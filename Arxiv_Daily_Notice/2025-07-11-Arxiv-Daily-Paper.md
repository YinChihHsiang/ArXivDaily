 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have identified a class of compact galaxies at high redshifts ($4 \lesssim z \lesssim 11$), dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs). The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of $10^{5-8}{\rm\,M}_{\odot}$ in LRDs favor a heavy-seed origin. We propose a mechanism for their formation: Clusters of primordial black holes, formed through long-short mode coupling on small scales in the early Universe, undergo sequential mergers over extended timescales. This mechanism can evade cosmic microwave background distortions and result in heavy-seed SMBHs via runaway mergers. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to solve the Smoluchowski coagulation equation and determine the runaway merging timescale. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave background offers a distinct signature of this process, and the forming SMBHs can be highly spinning at their formation due to the spin residual of the cluster from tidal fields. This mechanism may explain the rapidly spinning SMBHs in LRDs under the assumption of obscured active galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 We present GokuNEmu, a ten-dimensional neural network emulator for the nonlinear matter power spectrum, designed to support next-generation cosmological analyses. Built on the Goku $N$-body simulation suite and the T2N-MusE emulation framework, GokuNEmu predicts the matter power spectrum with $\sim 0.5 \%$ average accuracy for redshifts $0 \leq z \leq 3$ and scales $0.006 \leq k/(h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}) \leq 10$. The emulator models a 10D parameter space that extends beyond $\Lambda$CDM to include dynamical dark energy (characterized by $w_0$ and $w_a$), massive neutrinos ($\sum m_\nu$), the effective number of neutrinos ($N_\text{eff}$), and running of the spectral index ($\alpha_\text{s}$). Its broad parameter coverage, particularly for the extensions, makes it the only matter power spectrum emulator capable of testing recent dynamical dark energy constraints from DESI. In addition, it requires only $\sim $2 milliseconds to predict a single cosmology on a laptop, orders of magnitude faster than existing emulators. These features make GokuNEmu a uniquely powerful tool for interpreting observational data from upcoming surveys such as LSST, Euclid, the Roman Space Telescope, and CSST.

 - **Abstract**
 Dense star clusters are thought to contribute significantly to the merger rates of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. We combine $N$-body dynamic models of realistic dense star clusters with cluster formation histories to estimate the merger rate distribution as a function of primary mass for merging BBHs formed in these environments. It has been argued that dense star clusters -- most notably old globular clusters -- predominantly produce BBH mergers with primary masses $M_p\approx30\,M_{\odot}$. We show that dense star clusters forming at lower redshifts -- and thus having higher metallicities -- naturally produce lower-mass BBH mergers. We find that cluster BBH mergers span a wide range of primary mass, from about $6\,M_{\odot}$ to above $100\,M_{\odot}$, with a peak near $8\,M_{\odot}$, reproducing the overall merger rate distribution inferred from gravitational wave detections. Our results show that most low-mass BBH mergers (about $95\%$ with $M_p\lesssim 20\,M_{\odot}$) originate in metal-rich ($Z \sim Z_{\odot}$) dense star clusters, while more massive BBH mergers form predominately in metal-poor globular clusters. We also discuss the role of hierarchical mergers in shaping the BBH mass distribution. Gravitational wave detection of dynamically-formed low-mass BBH mergers -- potentially identifiable by features such as isotropic spin distributions -- may serve as probes of cluster formation histories in metal-rich environments at low redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observational results from the DESI collaboration reveal tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and favor a scenario in which dark energy (DE) decays over time. The DESI DR2 data also suggest that the DE equation of state (EoS) may have been phantom-like ($w < - 1$) in the past, evolving to $w > - 1$ at present, implying a recent crossing of the phantom divide at $w = - 1$. Scalar field models of DE naturally emerge in ultraviolet-complete theories such as string theory, which is typically formulated in higher dimensions. In this work, we investigate a class of thawing scalar field models propagating on a (4+1)-dimensional phantom braneworld, and demonstrate that their effective EoS exhibits a phantom-divide crossing. Alongside the Hubble parameter and EoS of DE, we also analyse the evolution of the Om diagnostic, and demonstrate that the time dependence of these quantities is in excellent agreement with the DESI DR2 observations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, and find that the $\chi^2$ values for all our models are remarkably close to that of the widely used CPL parametrisation, indicating that our models fit the data very well.
#### AT2019cmw: A highly luminous, cooling featureless TDE candidate from the disruption of a high mass star in an early-type galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 We present optical/UV photometric and spectroscopic observations, as well as X-ray and radio follow-up, of the extraordinary event AT2019cmw. With a peak bolometric luminosity of ~$\mathrm{10^{45.6}\,erg\,s^{-1}}$, it is one of the most luminous thermal transients ever discovered. Extensive spectroscopic follow-up post-peak showed only a featureless continuum throughout its evolution. This, combined with its nuclear location, blue colour at peak and lack of prior evidence of an AGN in its host lead us to interpret this event as a `featureless' tidal disruption event (TDE). It displays photometric evolution atypical of most TDEs, cooling from ~30 kK to ~10 kK in the first ~300 days post-peak, with potential implications for future photometric selection of candidate TDEs. No X-ray or radio emission is detected, placing constraints on the presence of on-axis jetted emission or a visible inner-accretion disk. Modelling the optical light curve with existing theoretical prescriptions, we find that AT2019cmw may be the result of the disruption of a star in the tens of solar masses by a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Combined with a lack of detectable star formation in its host galaxy, it could imply the existence of a localised region of star formation around the SMBH. This could provide a new window to probe nuclear star formation and the shape of the initial mass function (IMF) in close proximity to SMBHs out to relatively high redshifts.
#### Investigating non-Keplerian motion in flare events with astrometric data

 - **Abstract**
 The GRAVITY interferometer has achieved microarcsecond precision in near-infrared interferometry, enabling tracking of flare centroid motion in the strong gravitational field near the Sgr A*. It might be promising to serve as a unique laboratory for exploring the accretion matter near black holes or testing Einstein's gravity. Recent studies debated whether there is a non-Keplerian motion of the flares in the GRAVITY dataset. It motivates us to present a comprehensive analysis based on error estimation under the Bayesian framework. This study uses asctrometric flare data to investigate the possibility that the flares exhibit deviations from the circular Keplerian motion. By fixing the black hole mass of Sgr A* and using the averaged astrometric data from the four flares, our results find that the super-Keplerian orbit is favored at the near $1\sigma$ confidence level, where the non-Keperian parameter is $\omega/\omega_k=1.45^{+0.35}_{-0.38}$. By treating the black hole mass as a free parameter, both the averaged and individual data exhibit no significant evidence in favor of non-Keplerian motions, where the non-Keplerian parameter is close to $1$ within $1\sigma$ confidence level. We further analyze flares undergoing planar geodesic motion, where the orbital circularity parameter is $\gamma = 0.99_{-0.10}^{+0.07}$. This indicates that the astrometric data favor the circular orbits. Future improvements in astrometry precision might enable stronger constraints on the kinematical behavior of the flares, potentially offering insights into black hole physics or accretion matter in the strong-field regime.
#### The Impact of Natal Kicks on Black Hole Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 In massive binary-star systems, supernova explosions can significantly alter the orbit during the formation of compact objects. Some compact objects are predicted to form via direct collapse, a scenario with negligible mass loss and no baryonic ejecta emitted. In this scenario, most of the energy is released via neutrinos, and any resulting natal kick arises from asymmetries in their emission. Here I investigate stellar collapse leading to binary black hole (BH) formation, with a focus on how the natal kick influences the gravitational-wave-driven merger time. Broadly, I find three regimes. For low natal kicks, the effect on the time-to-coalescence is negligible. For moderate natal kicks, if the binary remains bound, up to 50% of binary BHs experience a decrease in their time-to-coalescence by more than an order of magnitude. For large natal kicks, although most binaries become unbound, those that remain bound may acquire retrograde orbits and/or lead to shorter time-to-coalescence. For binary BH mergers, large natal kicks ($\gtrsim100$ km/s) are hard to reconcile with both neutrino natal kicks and the complete collapse scenario. This suggests that retrograde orbits and shortened merger times could only arise in volatile BH formation scenarios or if spin-axis tossing is at work. Consequently, electromagnetic observations of BHs in massive star binaries within the Local Group offer a more effective means to probe the physics behind complete collapse. Another promising population for deciphering the complete collapse scenario is that of massive, wide binaries. Although Gaia may help shed light on these systems, longer observational baselines will likely be needed to fully understand the roles of neutrino natal kicks and stellar collapse in BH formation.
#### Whispers from the Early Universe: The Ringdown of Primordial Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by the ringdown phase of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe. As the ringdown signal is independent of the PBH formation mechanism, the resulting SGWB offers a model-independent probe of PBHs. We numerically compute the ringdown waveform and derive the corresponding SGWB. We show that such a signal could be detected by future pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) for PBHs heavier than the solar mass. Additionally, we evaluate the SGWB from binary PBH mergers and demonstrate that it lies within the sensitivity bands of next-generation ground-based interferometers such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, suggesting a multi-band observational strategy for probing the PBH dark matter scenario.
#### Simulation of Binary-Single Interactions in AGN Disks II: Merger Probability of Binary Black Holes during Chaotic Triple Process

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass binary black hole\,(BBH) mergers resulting from binary-single interactions\,(BSIs) in active galactic nucleus\,(AGN) disks are a potential source of gravitational wave\,(GW) events with measurable eccentricities. Previous hydrodynamical simulations have shown that ambient gas can significantly influence the dynamics of BSIs. However, due to limitations such as the use of purely Newtonian dynamics and small sample sizes, a direct estimation of the BBH merger probability during BSI has remained elusive. In this work, we directly quantify the merger probability, based on a suite of 1800 two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations coupled with post-Newtonian \emph{N}-body calculations. Our results demonstrate that dense gas can enhance the merger probability by both shrinking the spatial scale of the triple system and increasing the number of binary-single encounters. These two effects together boost the merger probability by a factor of $\sim$5, from 4\% to as high as 20\%. Among the two effects, our analysis suggests that the increase in encounter frequency plays a slightly more significant role in driving the enhancement. Moreover, this enhancement becomes more significant at larger radial distances from the central SMBH, since the total gas mass enclosed within the Hill sphere of the triple system increases with radius. Finally, the BSI process in AGN disks can naturally produce double GW merger events within a timescale of $\sim$year, which may serve as potential observational signatures of BSI occurring in AGN disk environments.
#### Exploring non-cold dark matter in a scenario of dynamical dark energy with DESI DR2 data

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of DESI hint that dark matter (DM) may not be cold but have a non-zero equation of state (EoS) parameter, and that dark energy (DE) may not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we explore the possibility of a non-zero DM EoS parameter within the framework of dynamical DE. We perform analysis by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia supernova (SN) data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. When using the combination of CMB, BAO, and SN data, our results indicate a preference for a non-zero DM EoS parameter at the $2.8\sigma$ and $3.3\sigma$ level within the content of a constant DE EoS. In contrast, for a time-evolving DE EoS parameterized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, this preference decreases to $0.8\sigma$ and $1.1\sigma$. Furthermore, allowing a non-zero DM EoS yields best-fit values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ that exhibit smaller deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM expectations, and Bayesian evidence analysis shows a comparable preference for this model relative to $\Lambda$CDM. The overall results of this work indicate that a non-zero DM EoS parameter warrants further exploration and investigation.
#### Probing small-scale primordial power spectra with tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale primordial perturbations have been well constrained by current cosmological observations, but the properties of small-scale perturbations remain elusive. This study focuses on second-order tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves (TSIGWs) generated by large-amplitude primordial scalar and tensor perturbations on small scales. We provide the analytical expressions for the kernel functions and the corresponding energy density spectra of second-order TSIGWs. By combining observations of SGWB across different scales, TSIGWs can be used to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations and primordial gravitational waves. Furthermore, we discuss the feasibility of TSIGWs dominating the current PTA observations under various primordial power spectra scenarios. Our results indicate that TSIGWs generated by monochromatic primordial power spectra might be more likely to dominate the current PTA observations.
#### A case study of GW190425 for classifying binary neutron star versus binary black hole mergers and constraining asymmetric dark matter with gravitational wave detectors

 - **Abstract**
 The LIGO Scientific, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration has identified two binary neutron star merger candidates, GW170817 and GW190425, along with several binary black hole candidates. While GW170817 was confirmed as a BNS merger through its electromagnetic counterparts, GW190425 lacked such observations, leaving its classification uncertain. We examine the possibility that GW190425 originated from black holes that merged after dark matter accretion caused their progenitor neutron stars to implode. Using this event, we place constraints on dark matter parameters, such as its mass and interaction cross section. We simulate GW190425-like events and analyze them using future gravitational wave detector networks, including upcoming upgrades to current detector networks and next-generation observatories. We show that a network with A+ sensitivity can not classify a GW190425-like event with sufficient confidence. Detector networks with A# sensitivity can classify such events only if the neutron stars follow a relatively stiff equation of state, whose stronger tidal imprint differs measurably from a binary black hole waveform. Next-generation observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer recover the tidal signature even for soft, compact stars, enabling confident classification. Finally, we forecast the dark matter constraints that future gravitational wave networks could achieve for similar events.
#### Gravitational Quasinormal Modes and Grey-Body Factors of Bonanno-Reuter Regular Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 We study gravitational perturbations of the Bonanno--Reuter quantum-corrected black hole arising in the asymptotic safety scenario, focusing on QNMs and grey-body factors. Assuming the RG parameter $\tilde{\omega}$ is fixed to its phenomenologically motivated value, we treat the interpolation parameter $\gamma$ as free and investigate how it modifies the black hole's response to axial gravitational perturbations. Quasinormal frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB method with Padé approximants, and their dependence on $\gamma$ and the black hole mass $M$ is analyzed. We find that the Schwarzschild limit is rapidly recovered for large $M$ or large $\gamma$, while significant deviations arise in the quantum regime. The accuracy of the WKB results is confirmed by time-domain integration of the wave equation. Comparison of grey-body factors computed via both the WKB method and the quasinormal mode correspondence are in a good concordance. Our findings indicate that quantum corrections can leave significant imprints in the ringdown and radiation spectra, while preserving consistency with classical results in the appropriate limit.
#### Post-Newtonian expansion of fluxes from a scalar charge on an inclined-spherical orbit about a Kerr black hole

 - **Abstract**
 Efforts are underway to accurately model extreme-mass-ratio inspirals for binaries with a spinning (Kerr) primary. At lowest order the adiabatic evolution depends on the radiation fluxes. Fluxes and other self-force quantities can be expanded analytically in post-Newtionian (PN) series allowing the early evolutionary phase to be understood. When it comes to more complicated background geodesic orbits, it proves useful to use the scalar field model problem to guide development and testing of techniques. In this paper, we present analytical expressions for the scalar fluxes from a scalar point-charge in inclined-spherical orbit about a Kerr black hole up to 12PN relative order, with expressions that are exact in terms of the inclination parameter $x$ and black hole spin $a$. The expressions are constructed using the Mano, Suzuki, and Takasugi (MST) method of solving the scalar wave equation in a Kerr background. We compare the numerical evaluation of these flux expressions to full numerical ($s=0$) Teukolsky code results, examining their degree of utility as the strong-field region is approached.
#### Polymer Black Hole Surrounded by Quintessence

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study the polymer black hole solution surrounded by a quintessence field. The influence of quintessence on the polymer black hole is investigated through its thermodynamic properties, such as the Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat, which allow us to address the question of thermodynamic stability. We then calculate bounds on the electromagnetic greybody factors and photon emission rates of the black hole, highlighting the interplay between quintessence and quantum gravity effects in determining these phenomena. We also examine the effects of quintessence and quantum gravity on the geodesics and shadows of massless particles around the black hole. Our results are further compared with observational data of the Sagittarius A black hole from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration.
#### Implications of Rastall Theory on Stellar Solutions admitting Vanishing Complexity: A New Perspective

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07425

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, the notion of complexity factor and its implication is extended to the framework of non-conserved Rastall theory of gravity. First of all, the field equations governing a static spherical geometry associated with the anisotropic fluid are formulated. The mass function corresponding to the considered geometry is defined in terms of both matter and geometric quantities. The orthogonal decomposition of the Riemann tensor is then performed through which a family of scalar quantities, known as structure scalars, is obtained. Using the Herrera's recent definition, one of the scalars among them is claimed as the complexity factor, \emph{i.e.}, $\mathcal{Y}_{TF}$. Since there are extra degrees of freedom in the gravitational equations, some constraints are needed to make their solution possible to obtain. In this regard, a well-known vanishing complexity condition is introduced along with three different constraints which ultimately lead to distinct stellar models. In order to check their physical feasibility, a detailed graphical interpretation is provided using multiple values of the Rastall parameter. It is concluded that the obtained results in all three cases are consistent with those of general relativity. Further, the Rastall theory provides more suitable results in the case of model 2, indicating its superiority over Einstein's gravity theory.

 - **Abstract**
 As first discovered by Choptuik, the black hole threshold in the space of initial data for general relativity shows both surprising structure and surprising simplicity. Universality, power-law scaling of the black hole mass, and scale echoing have given rise to the term ``critical phenomena''. They are explained by the existence of exact solutions which are attractors within the black hole threshold, that is, attractors of codimension one in phase space, and which are typically self-similar. Critical phenomena give a natural route from smooth initial data to arbitrarily large curvatures visible from infinity, and are therefore likely to be relevant for cosmic censorship, quantum gravity, astrophysics, and our general understanding of the dynamics of general relativity. Major additions since the 2010 version of this review are numerical simulations beyond spherical symmetry, in particular of vacuum critical collapse, and new sections on mathematical results in PDE blowup (as a toy model for singularity formation) and on naked singularity formation in GR.
#### Tidal effects in gravitational and scalar waveforms and fluxes to one post-Newtonian order in massless scalar-tensor theories

 - **Abstract**
 Within scalar-tensor (ST) theories, neutron stars in binary systems experience tidal deformations caused by both their companion and the scalar field. These deformations are strongly correlated to the star's internal structure and composition. Accurately modeling their imprint on the emitted gravitational waves will be essential for interpreting the high-precision data expected from future detectors and for disentangling potential signatures of modified gravity from those arising due to the properties of neutron star matter. Using the post-Newtonian multipolar-post-Minkowskian formalism adapted to ST theories, and working within the adiabatic approximation, we compute the tidal corrections to the gravitational and scalar energy fluxes, and to the waveform phasing, at the first post-Newtonian (PN) order beyond the standard quadrupole radiation in general relativity. This corresponds to 2PN order beyond the leading-order dipolar tidal contribution. At this accuracy, three independent types of tidal deformability (scalar, tensorial, and mixed scalar-tensorial) contribute to the signal. We also derive the gravitational and scalar waveform amplitude modes, including the memory ones, to the same accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the quantum dynamics of a closed bosonic string in the curved spacetime of an AdS$_5$-Schwarzschild black hole. Starting from the Polyakov action, we perform a canonical quantization of the string and formulate its quantum mechanical equation of motion in the Schrödinger (string coordinate) representation. This framework facilitates in obtaining quantum mechanical wave equation governing the radial and angular modes of the string. A central result of our analysis is the emergence of a trapping radius in the exterior region of the black hole. Near this radius, the radial motion of the string is governed by an effective potential that supports small, quantized oscillations, akin to a quantum harmonic oscillator. This behavior indicates a localization of the string at the trapping surface, where it becomes dynamically confined. The angular sector of the wave function is found to be governed by the confluent Heun equation, yielding confluent Heun functions as the angular part of the wave function. The emergence of a trapping surface is analogous to the stretched horizon proposed by Susskind in the context of black hole complementarity. The quantized harmonic oscillation of the string at the trapping radius complements with the Planck's black body whence the string can emit black-body radiation. Thus, the quantum dynamics of strings in black hole spacetimes offers a novel path to probing the quantum origin of Hawking radiation.
#### Metric reconstruction and the Hamiltonian for eccentric, precessing binaries in the small-mass-ratio limit

 - **Abstract**
 We calculate the first-order (in the mass-ratio) metric perturbation produced by a small body on an eccentric, precessing bound orbit about a Kerr black hole. We reconstruct the metric perturbation from the maximal spin-weight Weyl scalars, $\psi_0$ and $\psi_4$, using four different methods. The first two follow the work of Chrzanowski, Cohen, Kegeles, and Wald and reconstruct the metric perturbation from either $\psi_0$ or $\psi_4$, leading to perturbations in the ingoing or outgoing radiation gauges. The other two methods build upon the work of Aksteiner, Andersson, and B{ä}ckdahl and reconstruct the metric perturbation from both $\psi_0$ and $\psi_4$. We compare the local and asymptotic behaviors of the metric across different gauges. We also calculate the generalized redshift invariant along eccentric, precessing orbits in Kerr spacetime for the first time and make the numerical methods employed in these calculations openly available through the Python library \texttt{pybhpt}. Building off recent work by Lewis \emph{et al.}, we also relate our redshift data to the Hamiltonian of the system. Combining our numerical data with this Hamiltonian formulation provides a method for generating waveforms that include post-adiabatic conservative effects and acts as a useful bridge between results in self-force, effective-one-body, and post-Newtonian theory.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, a gauge theory of unified gravity [Rep. Prog. Phys. 88, 057802 (2025)] has been developed to extend the Standard Model to include gravity. Here we present unified gravity using the ordinary four-vector and tensor field notation of the Standard Model. The main goal of the present work is to extend the original Minkowski spacetime formulation of the theory to account for graviton-graviton interaction. This is a necessary extension for problems involving interactions between gravitational fields, for example, in the propagation of gravitational waves in external gravitational potentials. The 4xU(1) gauge invariance of unified gravity is preserved in this extension.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel method to efficiently search for long-duration gravitational wave transients emitted by new-born neutron star remnants of binary neutron star coalescences or supernovae. The detection of these long-transient gravitational waves would contribute to the understanding of the properties of neutron stars and fundamental physics. Additionally, studying gravitational waves emitted by neutron stars can provide valuable tests of general relativity and offer insights into the neutron star population, of which only a small fraction appears to be observable through current electromagnetic telescopes. Our approach uses GPUs and the JAX library in Python, resulting in significantly faster processing compared to previous methods. The efficiency of this code enables wide regions of the sky to be covered, eliminating the need for precise pinpointing of mergers or supernovae. This method will be deployed in searches for long-transient gravitational waves following any detection of a binary neutron star system merger in the latest O4 science run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration, which started in May 2023 with a significant improvement in sensitivity with respect to previous runs.

 - **Abstract**
 The asymptotic structure of space-time is studied by imposing conditions on the asymptotics of the metric. These conditions are weak enough to include large classes of physically relevant isolated space-times, but have a rich enough structure to be able to define important physically meaningful quantities like mass, angular momentum, and gravitational waves. By using a unified expansion of the metric in a neighborhood of spatial infinity that includes a piece of null infinity, we connect the asymptotic expansions of solutions to Einstein's equations in the different asymptotic regimes. Within the class of space-times under consideration, we find a connection between the peeling properties of the Weyl scalars and symmetries of initial data near spatial infinity. In particular, we show that for initial data that to leading order is symmetric under parity + time reversal, $\Psi_2$ has the usual $1/r^3$ fall-off rate at null infinity. If, in addition, the subleading part of the data is antisymmetric under parity + time reversal, then $\Psi_1$ has the usual $1/r^4$ fall-off rate at future null infinity.
