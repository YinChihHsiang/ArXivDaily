 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational wave event GW231123 detected by the LIGO interferometers during their fourth observing run features two black holes with source-frame masses of $137^{+22}_{-17} M_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52} M_\odot $ -- well within or above the pair-instability black hole mass gap predicted by standard stellar evolution theory. Both black holes are also inferred to be rapidly spinning ($\chi_1 \simeq 0.9$, $\chi_2 \simeq 0.8$). The primary object in GW231123 is the heaviest stellar mass black hole detected to date, which, together with its extreme rotation, raises questions about its astrophysical origin. Accounting for the unusually large spin of $\sim 0.9$ with hierarchical mergers requires some degree of fine tuning. We investigate whether such a massive, highly spinning object could plausibly form from the collapse of a single rotating massive star. We simulate stars with an initial core mass of $160 \rm M_\odot$ -- sufficient to produce BH masses at the upper edge of the 90% credible interval for $m_1$ in GW231123 -- across a range of rotation rates and $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rates. We find that: (i) rotation shifts the pair-instability mass gap to higher masses, introducing a significant ingredient that correlates masses and spins in gravitational wave predictions; and (ii) highly spinning BHs with masses $\gtrsim 150 \rm M_\odot$ can form above the mass gap, implying that stellar evolution alone is sufficient to explain GW231123. Our results suggest that the primary object of GW231123 may be the first directly observed black hole that formed via direct core collapse following the photodisintegration instability.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to retrieve cosmological parameters from photometric surveys, we need to estimate the distribution of the photometric redshift in the sky with excellent accuracy. We use and apply three different machine learning methods to publicly available Dark Energy Survey data release 2 (DR2): a) Artificial Neural Network for photometric redshifts (ANNz2); b) Gaussian processes for photometric redshifts (GPz); and c) Keras, a deep learning application programming interface in Python. We compare these different techniques applied to training data obtained from the VIPERS survey. To deal with the incompleteness of the VIPERS catalogue, we use a space-partitioning data structure (K-d Tree) to estimate the reliability of the obtained photometric redshifts. We build a catalogue which is robust to the lack of training data in certain regions of colour space. We use the photometric data to create maps of overdensity as a function of the redshift distribution for more than 500 million galaxies. These maps split the sky into several onion-like redshift slices, which can be readily used for cosmological parameter estimation. On each angular slice, we create and present maps of the angular distribution of galaxies in that slice as well as an estimate of the redshift distribution, $n(z)$, related to the galaxy distribution of that slice, which is recovered from the redshift estimation methods. We achieve a sub-sample of DES galaxies, which are well matched to the VIPERS sample with an accuracy of the photometric redshifts with a $\sigma_{68}\sim0.035$ and a catastrophic outlier rate of the order of 3 per cent.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. The analysis reveals that the matter density parameter, $\Omega_m$, changes with redshift, and this change is significantly influenced by the LRG1 datapoint from the DESI DR2 survey. We find that including LRG1 strongly affects the predictions of these models, especially for $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_0$, with the latter shifting from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 datapoint. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0>-1$, $\omega_a<0$, and $\omega_0+\omega_a<-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are excluded.

 - **Abstract**
 The latest observational data of Planck satellite shows nontrivial value of polarization rotation angle caused by cosmic birefringence in the early universe. Moreover, the asymmetry of baryons versus anti-baryons still remains mysterious. Both of them indicates that there should be hidden new physics such as fundamental symmetry breaking. In this paper, we try to interpret these two events in framework of nonmetricity modified gravity. We introduce an interaction term between nonmetricity-based function and matter current, and calculate both the rotation angle and baryon-to-photon ratio. We also constrain the model parameters using the current observational data. With some specific examples, we demonstrate that in nonmetricity gravity theory, these two events can be interpreted in a unified way.

 - **Abstract**
 Owing to sparse spectroscopic observations, the classification of faint satellites as either dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies or self-gravitating star clusters remains unresolved. The recently discovered Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 (UMa3/U1) object, with its measured velocity dispersion, provides a rare observational anchor in this regime. Despite its cluster-like compactness, its inferred dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M_dyn/L) suggests a dark matter-dominated nature, prompting interpretations of UMa3/U1 as a microgalaxy, though current measurements remain inconclusive. Thousand-level M_dyn/L values are not unique to galaxies; self-gravitating dark star clusters (DSCs) can reach comparable levels via energy injection driven by a centrally segregated black hole subsystem (BHSub), which accelerates the evaporation of luminous stars and leads to a super-virial appearance with elevated velocity dispersion. To assess whether UMa3/U1 is a DSC, we conducted direct N-body simulations and identified a model that successfully reproduces both its compact structure and elevated M_dyn/L, supporting a self-gravitating cluster origin. We find the cluster entered the DSC phase around 4 Gyr ago, with its luminous stars expected to be depleted within the next 1 Gyr, followed by the gradual disruption of the central BHSub over the subsequent Gyr. We broaden our analysis by mapping DSC evolutionary tracks in the size versus total luminosity (L) and M_dyn/L-L spaces, showing that DSCs occupy a region overlapping with faint, ambiguous satellites. In the M_dyn/L-L diagram, DSCs trace a transitional channel bridging globular clusters and dwarf galaxies as they rise from M_dyn/L ~ 2 to 10^4 M_sun/L_sun.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we investigate quark deconfinement in neutrons stars and their mergers, focusing on the effects of higher orders for the phase transition between hadronic and quark matter. The different descriptions we use to describe matter microscopically contain varying particle degrees of freedom, including nucleons, hyperons, Delta baryons, and light and strange quarks. We use tabulated equations of state from the CompOSE database in which the quark deconfinement phase transition is described as being first-order, and then smooth it out by introducing a percolation, replacing the single first-order phase transition with two transitions of second or third order. We then perform binary neutron-star merger simulations using these new equations of st ate, focusing on groups of binaries with the same single-star mass, radius, and tidal deformability, but different equations of state. We go on to discuss differences in their evolution, and the ramifications for interpreting future gravitational wave observations and the potential to learn about dense matter.

 - **Abstract**
 Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) are ubiquitous in many early-Universe processes accompanied by non-Gaussianity; hence, precise calculations of SIGWs involve a full understanding of non-Gaussianity. In this Letter, we propose to use the lattice simulations to directly calculate the energy density spectra of SIGWs with non-Gaussianity up to all orders. Our proposal has been first verified to match the existing semi-analytical results with non-Gaussianity, and then applied to more general cases, including high-order primordial non-Gaussianities, the logarithmic dependence in curvature perturbations, the curvaton model, and the ultra slow-roll model. We find that even a modest non-Gaussianity can significantly alter ultraviolet behaviors in SIGW spectra, necessitating special cautions in future detections as well as mutual constraints on/from primordial black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 The present thesis aims to tackle two critical aspects of present and future cosmological analysis of Large-Scale Structure (LSS): accurate modelling of the nonlinear matter power spectrum beyond $\Lambda$CDM, and efficient computational techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation. Both are crucial for testing alternative cosmologies and avoiding spurious results. We focus on the Dark Scattering (DS) model, describing pure momentum transfer between dark matter -- dark energy through the parameter $A_{\rm ds}$. To capture DS effects, we adopt the halo model reaction framework within $\tt{ReACT}$, compute the nonlinear DS spectrum, and validate it against $N$-body simulations. We further include baryonic feedback and massive neutrinos, finding degeneracies between DS and baryonic effects but not with neutrinos. We then constrain DS using cosmic shear from KiDS-1000, accelerated by neural emulators from $\tt{CosmoPower}$, which speed up predictions by $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$. Our DS emulator, trained on halo model reaction outputs, preserves percent-level accuracy and incorporates baryonic feedback. Analysing KiDS shear statistics, we obtain $\vert A_{\rm ds}\vert \lesssim 20$ b/GeV at $68 \%$ C.L. Combining KiDS with Planck CMB and BAO data, we find $A_{\rm ds}=10.6^{+4.5}_{-7.3}$ b/GeV at $68 \%$ C.L., suggesting the DS model as a promising resolution to the $S_8$ tension. Finally, we present weak lensing forecasts for Stage IV surveys using an automatically differentiable pipeline with $\tt{jax-cosmo}$ and gradient-based samplers in $\tt{NumPyro}$, reducing computational cost from months on CPUs to days on GPUs. Model evidence is evaluated with $\tt{harmonic}$ under multiple scale cuts. To put things into perspective, the modelling strategies and machine learning accelerations developed here provide powerful tools for the next generation of LSS cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise measurements of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at low redshifts ($z$) serve as one of the most viable keys to unlocking our understanding of cosmic expansion, isotropy, and growth of structure. The Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernovae (DEBASS) program will deliver the largest uniformly calibrated low-$z$ SN Ia data set in the southern hemisphere to date. DEBASS utilizes the Dark Energy Camera to image supernovae in conjunction with the Wide-Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) to gather comprehensive host galaxy information. By using the same photometric instrument as both the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the DECam Local Volume Exploration Survey, DEBASS not only benefits from a robust photometric pipeline and well-calibrated images across the southern sky, but can replace the historic and external low-$z$ samples that were used in the final DES supernova analysis. DEBASS has accumulated more than 400 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia in the redshift range of $0.01<z<0.08$ from 2021 to mid-2025, and, in this paper along with a companion paper Acevedo et al. submitted, we present an early data release of 77 SNe within the DES footprint to demonstrate the merit and constraining power of the data set. Here, we introduce the DEBASS program, discuss its scientific goals and the advantages it offers for supernova cosmology, and present our initial results. With this early data release, we find a robust median absolute standard deviation of Hubble diagram residuals of $\sim$0.10 mag and an initial measurement of the host-galaxy mass step of $0.06\pm0.04$ mag, both before performing bias corrections. This low scatter shows the promise of a low-$z$ SN Ia program with a well-calibrated telescope and high signal-to-noise ratio across multiple bands.

 - **Abstract**
 Inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), we investigate the Reissner-Nordström (RN) black hole (BH) solution coupled with a cloud of strings in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) background, surrounded by a quintessence-like fluid. We begin by analyzing the optical properties of the BH through null geodesic motion, deriving an effective potential that governs photon dynamics. This effective potential is central to understanding key phenomena such as photon trajectories, circular null orbits, photon sphere, and the resulting BH shadow. Subsequently, we study the dynamics of neutral test particles by deriving effective potential that describes their motion. Using the potential, we compute the specific energy and specific angular momentum of neutral particles in circular orbits around the BH and analyze the outcomes. We also investigate the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO) and demonstrate how various geometrical and physical properties influence the radius of ISCO. Furthermore, we explore the thermodynamic properties of the BH solution by deriving key quantities such as the Hawking temperature, entropy, Gibbs free energy, internal energy, and specific heat capacity. Throughout the study, we demonstrate that the geodesic structure, scalar field behavior, and thermodynamic properties are significantly influenced by parameters such as the string cloud, quantum correction, electric charge, the surrounding quintessence-like fluid, and the AdS curvature radius.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we calculate the mass distribution of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the matter-dominated (MD) era by the peak theory. We apply the Zel'dovich approximation to track the nonlinear evolution of overdensities and compute the PBH abundance and mass function by incorporating a PBH formation criterion based on the hoop conjecture. We find that the PBH abundance $\beta$ follows the scaling law $\beta \simeq A_\gamma \sigma_h^{*5}$ for $\sigma_h^*\ll 1$. Here, $\sigma_h^*$ is the quantity that characterizes the variance of the density fluctuation at the horizon entry. We also find that, in contrast to the previous estimates, the PBH spin is very small for $\sigma_h^*\ll 1$ but could be larger for larger $\sigma_h^*$ and broader power spectra. Finally, specializing to a monochromatic power spectrum, we prove analytically that the PBH mass distribution becomes effectively monochromatic and reveal that the resultant PBH abundance is approximately 19 times the previous prediction.

#### Precession of spherical orbits for the spacetime without $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry induced by NUT charge

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical evidence has hinted at the existence of a nonzero NUT charge, which breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of spacetime and induces novel features in geodesics. In this work, we investigate the Lense-Thirring precession of the spherical orbits in the Kerr-Taub-NUT spacetime, with particular emphasis on its connection to recent observations of black hole jet precession. We analyze the reflection symmetry breaking in trajectories of the spherical orbits and extract their precession angular velocity. It is worth noting that in the absence of spin, the spherical orbits reduce to tilted circular orbits without precession, whereas for nonzero spin, the precession angular velocity increases with the absolute value of the NUT charge. We then model the motion of particles near the warp radius of a tilted accretion disk using the spherical orbits and constrain the black hole parameter space based on the observed jet precession of M87*. The results indicate that regions with low spin and large NUT charge were excluded, and that the jet precession measurements cannot distinguish the sign of the NUT charge. The excluded region is larger for retrograde accretion disks than for prograde ones. We also find that this observation do not allow a clear distinction between black holes and naked singularities. Moreover, we also explore how black hole parameters influence the structure of accretion disk. These results have important theoretical and astronomical significance for us to deeply understand NUT space-time.

#### Revisiting the maximum mass limit of strange stars in higher-order curvature-matter coupled gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the maximum mass limit of strange stars within the framework of modified gravity described by $f(\tilde{R},T)=R+\alpha R^{2}+2\beta T$, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $T$ denotes the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ characterise the contributions from higher-order curvature terms and the coupling between matter and geometry, respectively. By deriving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations from the modified field equations and applying the MIT bag model equation of state, we obtain the corresponding mass-radius relationships for strange stars. Our results show that, for suitable choices of $\alpha$, $\beta$, and bag parameter $(B_{g})$, the maximum mass limit of strange stars exceeds their general relativistic counterpart. Specifically, our model yields a maximum mass up to $3.11~M_{\odot}$, suggesting that the lighter companion of GW190814 could plausibly be a strange star within this theoretical framework.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the recent introduction of the Dirac bracket framework to compute spinning observables for the scattering of Kerr black holes, we initiate the study of conserved quantities from an on-shell amplitude perspective. We establish new results for the conservation of energy, angular momentum, the Rüdiger invariant and the quadrupolar Carter constant using the spinning radial action extracted from the literature both in the probe limit and beyond, up to third post-Minkowskian order in the conservative sector. Furthermore, we offer a new perspective on the spin-shift symmetry of the radial action, clarifying its role in the dynamics. Finally, we define a new on-shell notion of asymptotic integrability in the Liouville sense and present strong evidence that it is surprisingly satisfied by a spinning probe in Kerr up to quartic order in the probe spin, to all orders in the post-Minkowskian expansion. We further establish integrability beyond the probe limit at low PM orders. Our results suggest important new implications for the dynamics of Kerr black holes.
