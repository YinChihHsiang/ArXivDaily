#### Primordial Gravitational Waves in Parity-violating Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity
 - **Authors:** Rongrong Zhai, Chengjie Fu, Xiangyun Fu, Puxun Wu, Hongwei Yu
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06984

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06984

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the inflationary phenomenology of parity-violating (PV) extensions of symmetric teleparallel gravity by applying this PV gravity theory to axion inflation. The presence of PV terms induces velocity birefringence in the tensor perturbations. During inflation, when the inflaton rapidly traverses the cliff-like region in its potential, the tensor modes at specific scales for one of the two circular polarization states undergo significant amplification due to tachyonic instability. Consequently, the resulting primordial gravitational waves (GWs), characterized by a one-handed polarization and a multi-peak structure in their energy spectrum, exhibit a significant amplitude potentially detectable by LISA and Taiji, and their chirality could be determined by the LISA-Taiji network. The detection of such a chiral GW signal provides an opportunity to probe inflation and PV gravity theory.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate observational signatures of ultralight vector dark matter with masses $m \sim 10^{-24}$-$10^{-22}$ eV in pulsar timing arrays, taking into account general polarization states of the vector field. We find that vector dark matter induces pulsar timing residuals with nontrivial directional dependence, reflecting the anisotropic property and polarization structure specific to vector dark matter, unlike scalar dark matter. We also derive angular correlation curves of the timing residuals. Intriguingly, circular polarization of the vector dark matter enhances the quadrupole nature of the correlation curve, resulting in a more notable bending of the Hellings-Downs curve. The derived correlation curves offer a useful means to distinguish gravitational wave and dark matter contributions and to probe the nature of dark matter.

#### Preheating and gravitational waves in large-field hilltop inflation

 - **Abstract**
 The combined Planck, BICEP/Keck Array and BAO measurements of the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio from the cosmic microwave background observations severely constrain or completely rule out several models of inflationary potentials. On the other hand, the data seems to favor concave potentials over convex ones. In this paper, we study preheating and gravitational waves after inflation in a large-field, regularized hilltop potential where inflation takes place in the concave plateau. The inflaton, $\phi$, is coupled to a subdominant scalar field, $\chi$, through a quartic coupling. After inflation ends, $\phi$ oscillates about the potential minimum and becomes inhomogeneous. The growth of the fluctuation modes, $\delta\phi_k$ and $\delta\chi_k$, in a homogeneous, oscillating background is analyzed in linear perturbation theory, revealing that small modes likely experience broad self-resonance or external parametric resonance. To determine if the resonances are sufficiently strong to cause unstable growth of the modes we perform a lattice simulation. The lattice simulations demonstrate that, although the initial inhomogeneities generate a stochastic gravitational wave background that remains below the present observational limit, the fluctuations do not grow exponentially, and the occupation numbers of $\delta\phi_k$ and $\delta\chi_k$ remain close to zero.

#### Gravitational Wave Signatures of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions: LISA Detection Prospects for RX J1301.9+2747
 - **Authors:** Leif Lui, Alejandro Torres-Orjuela, Rudrani Kar Chowdhury, Lixin Dai

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07961

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07961

 - **Abstract**
 One prominent model for quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) is that they originate from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) involving stellar-mass objects orbiting around massive black holes and colliding with their accretion disks. We compute the gravitational wave signals from such a model, demonstrating that orbiter-disk interactions result in small frequency shifts and high-frequency tails due to the excitation of non-discrete modes. Interestingly, we show that QPE RX J1301.9+2747 could be detectable by future space-based gravitational wave detectors, provided a moderate eccentricity around $0.25$ and a mass exceeding $35\,M_\odot$ for the orbiter. Moreover, based on this QPE model, we show that the signal-to-noise ratio of the gravitational wave signals from QPEs, if detectable, will be sufficiently high to distinguish such systems from vacuum EMRIs and shed light on the origin of QPEs and environments around massive black holes.

#### Probing gravity beyond general relativity with bispectrum multipoles of cosmological tracers: I. Theoretical Foundations
 - **Authors:** Sukhdeep Singh Gill
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07990

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07990

 - **Abstract**
 The bispectrum, being sensitive to non-Gaussianity and mode coupling of cosmological fields induced by non-linear gravitational evolution, serves as a powerful probe for detecting deviations from General Relativity (GR). The signatures of modified gravity in the bispectrum are even more pronounced in redshift space, where anisotropies from peculiar velocities provide unbiased information on higher-order properties of gravity. We investigate the potential of all non-zero angular multipoles $B_l^m$ of redshift space bispectrum across all possible triangle configurations to probe degenerate higher-order scalar tensor (DHOST) theory. We show that the higher-order multipoles of the bispectrum with $l=2,4,6$ are more sensitive to the modifications in gravity than the spherically averaged monopole moment $l=0$. These multipoles demonstrate remarkable sensitivity to the higher-order growth history, which varies across triangle configurations, with acute triangles generally being the most sensitive to modification in GR. The values of various multipoles exhibit opposite signs in modified gravity compared to those predicted in GR, which serves as a robust indicator of the deviation from GR. We demonstrate that, unlike $l=2$ and $4$ multipoles, the $l=6$ multipoles with $m\leq 4$ are not affected by the quadratic bias and second-order tidal bias parameters, emphasising the need to leverage their capabilities in analyses. The $(l=6, m > 4)$ multipoles fail to capture the second-order growth, while all $l=8$ multipoles lack any independent information regarding modified gravity in both linear and nonlinear regimes.

#### Parametrizing the Hubble function instead of dark energy: Many possibilities
 - **Authors:** Sivasish Paul, Raj Kumar Das, Supriya Pan

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08072

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08072

 - **Abstract**
 In the present article, we propose a very simple parametrization of the Hubble function without parametrizing the dark components of the Universe. One of the novelties of the parametrization is that it may include a wide variety of the cosmological models, such as dark energy (both noninteracting and interacting fluids), modified gravity, cosmological matter creation and other known scenarios. The model is constrained with the latest astronomical probes from Hubble parameter measurements, three distinct versions of Type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+, DESY5, Union3) and baryon acoustic oscillations from Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument data releases 1 and 2. Our results suggest a mild deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model for most of the combined datasets. We also find that our model is thermodynamically consistent and performs well in the model comparison tests.

#### Coupled Time-Dependent Proton Acceleration and Leptonic-Hadronic Radiation in Turbulent Supermassive Black Hole Coronae

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08233

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulent coronae of supermassive black holes can accelerate non-thermal particles to high energies and produce observable radiation, but capturing this process is challenging due to comparable timescales of acceleration, cooling, and the development of cascades. We present a time-dependent numerical framework that self-consistently couples proton acceleration -- modeled by the Fokker-Planck equation -- with leptonic-hadronic radiation. For the neutrino-emitting Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, we reproduce the neutrino spectrum observed by IceCube, while satisfying gamma-ray constraints. We also consider a transient corona scenario, potentially emerging in non-jetted tidal disruption events like AT 2019dsg, and show that early-stage cascade feedback can impact proton acceleration and radiation processes in weaker coronae, producing delayed optical/ultraviolet, X-ray, and neutrino emissions of $\mathcal O(100~\rm d)$. This flexible code efficiently models multi-messenger signals from both steady and transient astrophysical sources, providing insights in combining particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08238

 - **Abstract**
 We show that primordial black holes (PBHs) in the $\textit{Stupendously Large Black Hole}$ mass range ($M \gtrsim 10^{11}\,M_\odot$) produce isocurvature perturbations exceeding current $\textit{Planck}$ Cosmic Microwave Background limits, thereby excluding them as a significant dark matter component.

#### Refined Thermodynamic Analysis of Perfect Fluid Dark Matter Black Holes in a Phantom Background

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06578

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we examine the thermodynamics of black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) by employing the Misner-Sharp energy framework. We extend the analysis to include the thermal fluctuations of these black holes when size reduces to small size, redefining key thermodynamic variables such as pressure, volume, temperature, internal energy, and entropy within the context of PFDM. Using these newly defined variables, we systematically calculate the enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat of PFDM black holes, incorporating perturbative thermal corrections. To assess the stability of these black holes, we perform a detailed graphical analysis of the specific heat as a function of the horizon radius, providing insights into the thermal stability of PFDM black holes. This comprehensive approach enhances our understanding of the thermodynamic properties and stability of black holes in the presence of dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 The primary aim of this work is to explore feasible bouncing cosmological solutions in the framework of $f(\mathcal{Q}, \mathcal{C})$ gravity, where $\mathcal{Q}$ denotes non-metricity and $\mathcal{C}$ indicates the boundary term. To achieve this, we analyze the dynamics of a Bianchi type-I spacetime with perfect fluid distribution. We consider various functional forms of $f(\mathcal{Q,C})$ theory to assess how this modified gravity framework influences cosmic evolution. Additionally, we examine the dynamics of different cosmological parameters to explore non-singular bounce solutions. We also use linear perturbation to study the stability analysis. Our findings reveal the breach of the null energy conditions, which is required for the existence of viable bounce solutions. The equation of state parameter demonstrates either a quintessence phase or a phantom regime of the universe, demonstrating that the cosmos is undergoing accelerating expansion. This gravitational framework presents a promising alternative to the standard cosmological model, presenting an innovative viewpoint on gravitational interactions and the dynamics of the early universe.

#### Cosmic Hysteresis in Reconstructed \textit{f(R)} Bounce Models: A Thermodynamic Study

 - **Abstract**
 We study the emergence of cosmic hysteresis in cyclic bouncing universes within the framework of analytically reconstructed $f(R)$ gravity. Using exact bouncing scale factor solutions of exponential and power-law forms, we reconstruct the corresponding $f(R)$ models and investigate the thermodynamic behavior of a minimally coupled scalar field in these geometries. The pressure evolution during expansion and contraction phases is shown to be asymmetric, leading to a non-vanishing thermodynamic work integral over each cycle, defined by $\oint p_\phi\, dV$. We identify closed hysteresis loops in the equation-of-state space and quantify the net energy transfer per cycle. Our results reveal that such reconstructed $f(R)$ models generically support irreversible evolution, demonstrating a natural emergence of the thermodynamic arrow of time. These findings provide new insight into the dissipative features of modified gravity and the long-term dynamics of cyclic cosmological scenarios.

#### Conditional non-linear stability of Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes in the full subextremal range

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06620

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06620

 - **Abstract**
 We show the stability of Kerr-de Sitter black holes, in the full subextremal range, as solutions of the vacuum Einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant under the assumption that mode stability holds for these spacetimes. The method is similar to the (unconditional) proof in the slowly rotating case by Hintz and Vasy. The key novelties are the implementation of constraint damping in the full subextremal range as well as the verification of a subprincipal symbol condition at the trapped set.

#### Reconciling Inflation with Hubble Anisotropies

 - **Abstract**
 There have been persistent suggestions, based on several diverse data sets, that the cosmic expansion is not exactly isotropic. It is not easy to develop a coherent theoretical account of such a ``Hubble anisotropy'', for, in standard General Relativity, intuition suggests that it contradicts the predictions of the very successful Inflationary hypothesis. We put this intuition on a firm basis, by proving that if we [a] make use of an Inflationary theory in which Inflation isotropises spatial geometry -- $\,$ this, of course, includes the vast majority of such theories -- $\,$ and if [b] we insist on assuming that spacetime has a strictly metric geometry (one in which the geometry is completely determined by a metric tensor), then indeed all aspects of the ``Hubble field'' must be isotropic. Conversely, should a Hubble anisotropy be confirmed, then either we must contrive to build anisotropy into Inflation from the outset, or we will have to accept that spacetime geometry is not strictly metric. We argue that allowing spacetime torsion to be non-zero would be by far the most natural way to accommodate such observations. Such theories make firm predictions, as for example that there should be a correlation between the degree of anisotropy at the end of Inflation and a certain specific component of the Hubble tension.

#### Analysis of Pantheon+ supernova data suggests evidence of sign-changing pressure of the cosmological fluid

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06861

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we revisit/reinterpret/extend the model-independent analysis method (which we now call spread - luminosity distance fitting, spread-LDF) from our previous work. We apply it to the updated supernova type Ia catalogue, Pantheon+ and recent GRB compilations. The procedure allows us, using only FLRW assumption, to construct good approximations for expansion history of the universe, re-confirming its acceleration to be a robust feature. When we also assume General Relativity ("GR"), we can demonstrate, without any matter/energy model in mind, the need for (possibly nonconstant) dark energy ("GDE"). We find hints for positive pressure of GDE at z>1 with implications on either the complexity of dark energy, or the validity of one of the cosmological principle, interpretation of SN Ia data, or GR.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive assessment of multiparameter tests of general relativity (GR) in the inspiral regime of compact binary coalescences using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Our analysis is based on an extensive set of simulated gravitational wave signals, including both general relativistic and non-GR sources, injected into zero-noise data colored by the noise power spectral densities of the LIGO and Virgo detectors at their designed sensitivities. We evaluate the performance of PCA-based methods in the context of two established frameworks: TIGER and FTI. For GR-consistent signals, we find that PCA enables stringent constraints on potential deviations from GR, even in the presence of multiple free parameters. Applying the method to simulated signals that explicitly violate GR, we demonstrate that PCA is effective at identifying such deviations. We further test the method using numerical relativity waveforms of eccentric binary black hole systems and show that missing physical effects-such as orbital eccentricity-can lead to apparent violations of GR if not properly included in the waveform models used for analysis. Finally, we apply our PCA-based test to selected real gravitational-wave events from GWTC-3, including GW190814 and GW190412. We present joint constraints from selected binary black hole events in GWTC-3, finding that the 90% credible bound on the most informative PCA parameter is $0.03^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$ in the TIGER framework and $-0.01^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ in the FTI framework, both of which are consistent with GR. These results highlight the sensitivity and robustness of the PCA-based approach and demonstrate its readiness for application to future observational data from the fourth observing runs of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA.

#### Nonlinear Ringdowns as Sources and Detectors of Quantum Gravitational Waves

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07348

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07348

 - **Abstract**
 Is gravity quantum mechanical? If so, we argue that nonlinear effects in black hole ringdowns - notably second harmonic generation - generates gravitational waves in non-classical states. While quantum features of these states such as sub-Poissonian statistics or entanglement could in principle be measured at interferometric detectors, the tiny coupling of gravity to matter makes this extremely challenging. Drawing on ideas from quantum optics, we instead propose that the nonlinearities in ringdowns could be used as strongly coupled detectors of quantum gravitational radiation, potentially offering a new route to probing the quantum nature of gravity.

#### Observational signatures and polarized images of rotating charged black holes in Kalb-Ramond Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the shadow images of rotating charged black holes in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity, using an accretion disk that is both optically and geometrically thin and located on the equatorial plane as the light source model. The results show that, compared to Sgr A*, the observational data of M87* impose stronger constraints on the charge parameter Q and the Lorentz-violating parameter G. Under the thin accretion disk model, a larger observer inclination theta_o deforms the inner shadow into a hat-like structure. The parameters (a, Q, G) mainly affect the size of the inner shadow and the brightness of the critical curve, where increasing these parameters reduces the shadow size and enhances the distinguishability of the critical curve. In the retrograde accretion disk case, the gravitational redshift significantly reduces the observed brightness of the image. In addition, we compute the distribution of the redshift factor on the projection screen. The results indicate that the Doppler effect induced by large theta_o enhances the blueshift in the image, while the light emitted by particles plunging into the black hole leads to strong redshift near the inner shadow. Finally, we study the polarization images under synchrotron radiation and find that the polarization intensity P_o reaches its maximum around the lensed image and higher-order images, whereas no polarization vectors appear within the inner shadow. This stands in sharp contrast to horizonless compact objects. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the shadow properties of charged black holes within Lorentz-violating gravity.

#### Comparing a Mass Shell Model for Compact Binaries with Observed Gravitational Waves

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07499

 - **Abstract**
 A recent study modeled coalescing compact binaries as a spinning and contracting mass shell geometry, reinterpreting the effective one-body model. Besides obtaining the respective waveform profiles that include rates of change in binary separation and orbital frequency, an expression for the mass-shell surface energy was derived to compute the anticipated energy radiated as gravitational waves. In this study, we revisit the surface energy derivation using a variational method that was recently used, and we recover the energy's dependence on the compact binary's reduced mass, symmetric mass ratio, and the normalized rotational speed at merger. For 31 out of 93 cataloged GW events within the O1, O2 and O3 observation runs, we compute the anticipated energy radiated as gravitational waves and compare these values with the observed energy, either directly measured or extracted from the total-minus-remnant mass difference. It is shown that the model presented in this work agrees well with observed energy measurements, within the error range and via 1:1 ratios spanning from $0.828$ to $0.997$ across 29 example events (the mean value of these 29 ratios being $0.941$), with GW190403_051519 serving as an outlier with the 1:1 ratio of $0.462$, demonstrating the precision and universality of the energy expression to be applied to current and future detections.

#### Dynamical Black Hole in the accelerating Universe approaching the future singularity -- Possible origin of (super-)massive black holes

 - **Abstract**
 We construct and investigate the dynamical black hole spacetime embedded in the expanding universe filled with cosmic fluid, such as dark energy. When the equation of state (EoS) parameter of the fluid is a constant, we find exact solutions of the Einstein equation where the Schwarzschild black hole is embedded in the expanding universe. This solution differs from the well-known McVittie metric, where the EoS parameter is not a constant but rather depends on the radial coordinate. It is shown that a dynamical black hole grows with the expansion of the universe. If primordial black holes are created before or during inflation, above dynamical black holes might be the origin of the supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies, massive black holes suggested by the GW231123 event, and also the dark matter. The case where the cosmic fluid EoS is more general is also considered so that the universe enters the epoch of finite-time future singularity. Thermodynamics and the behaviour of black holes around different future singularities are carefully investigated. It is then demonstrated that the black hole horizon enhances the tidal force, but near the horizon, the tidal force works to press the extended object, which is in contrast with a massive body near to future singularity. We also propose a new type of future singularity where the singularity inside the black hole is a sphere with a finite radius. When the radius of the spherical singularity becomes larger than the radius of the black hole horizon, it becomes naked. The universe may end up with a cosmic doomsday when the radius of the singularity becomes infinite.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07655

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the $k$-self-similar naked singularity solutions of the spherically symmetric Einstein--Scalar field system are unstable to black hole formation under perturbations that are totally supported in the interior region, in all regularities strictly below the threshold. The instability below the threshold is also established for exterior perturbations. We also show that general naked singularity solutions are unstable under interior BV perturbations, which provides a new insight into understanding the weak cosmic censorship conjecture for this model. In contrast to all previous results on the exterior instability of naked singularities (and even trapped surface formation), where only a single incoming null cone is considered, the novel approach to proving the interior instability is analyzing a family of incoming null cones becoming more and more singular.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the thermodynamic phase transition of ModMax anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes using Lyapunov exponents of massless and massive particles in unstable circular orbits. Our results demonstrate that the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponent serves as an efficient probe of the black hole's phase structure. We calculate the discontinuity in the Lyapunov exponent across the transition and show that it acts as an order parameter, exhibiting a critical exponent $\delta=1/2$ in the vicinity of the critical point. Furthermore, we explore the violation of the chaos bound, finding that the bound is violated when the horizon radius falls below a threshold value. We also examine how the ModMax parameter and the particle's angular momentum modify this threshold, revealing their role in controlling the onset of chaos bound violation.

 - **Abstract**
 The five-dimensional loop quantum Kaluza-Klein cosmology is constructed based on the symmetric reduction of the connection formulation of the full theory. Through semiclassical analysis, the effective scalar constraint for the cosmological model coupled with a dust field is derived, incorporating the quantum fluctuations of geometry as a subleading order correction. It demonstrates that the quantum model has the correct classical limit. The explicit solutions to the equations of motion show that the classical big bang and past big rip singularities in the classical model are avoided by a quantum bounce and a quantum collapse respectively in the effective model. In a particular scenario, the dynamical compactification of the extra dimension is realized, while the observable four-dimensional universe transitions through three distinct epochs: (i) a super-inflationary phase generating 55 e-folds with particular choices of the initial value, (ii) a decelerated expansion era, and (iii) a late-time accelerated expansion phase driven by quantum fluctuations. These results suggest that both cosmic inflation and dark energy may originate from the interplay between the compactified extra dimension and quantum geometric effects.

 - **Abstract**
 The event horizon is a source of irreversibility, analogous to statistical irreversibility. This is why for systems with an event horizon there is no difference between quantum and thermal fluctuations. Quantum processes of quantum tunneling determine the thermodynamics of these systems, their temperatures, entropies and fluctuations. We considered three examples of entropy variance that support this point of view: (i) the variance of the area of the black hole horizon, obtained by consideration of quantum fluctuations; (ii) the variance of the entropy of the Hubble volume in the de Sitter state, obtained by consideration of thermal fluctuations; and (iii) the variance of entropy in integers in the Planckon model, determined by the Poisson distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes, like any other object - respond to external fields like background electric and gravitational fields. At lowest order, the response of a black hole to, (e.g.) a gravitational wave in the $l^{th}$ spherical harmonic mode is to develop a generalized `quadrupole moment' in the same symmetry channel. The induced moment of the black hole is proportional to the external forcing field. The constant of proportionality between the field and the response is a function of the frequency $\omega$ of the incident perturbation. These constants of proportionality are sometimes called `Love' numbers in the study of astrophysical black holes. Using the `Large $D$ Membrane Paradigm' formalism, we compute gravitostatic black hole `Love' numbers (at $\omega \to 0$ limit), in large $D$. This work opens the road of using Large $D$ Membrane Paradigm formalism to extend the computation of these black hole `Love' numbers for all values of $\omega$ in large $D$ - which we announce in this paper.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the microstructure of asymptotically flat charged black holes through the lens of nonextensive Rényi statistics. A modified form of the Rényi entropy is proposed to incorporate compressibility effects, and geometrothermodynamics is applied within such a framework. Besides, by quantizing the black hole horizon area, we derive a microscopic description in terms of discrete degrees of freedom, with Rényi entropy providing a nonextensive generalization of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We compute the Rényi partition function and probability distribution in the canonical ensemble, highlighting significant deviations from Boltzmann-Gibbs behavior at finite temperature due to nonextensive effects. The black hole undergoes a first-order Van der Waals-like phase transition between small and large configurations, characterized by discontinuities in entropy and latent heat, both of which are shown to depend on the number of area quanta. A critical threshold emerges beyond which the transition becomes athermal. Additionally, we establish a thermodynamic duality between charged-AdS black holes in Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics and charged-flat Rényi black holes, expressed via a conformal transformation of state variables. This duality extends naturally to higher dimensions. Our results provide new insights into the microstructure of black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We argue that the special extremal slice inside an AdS black hole is dual to an absolutely maximally entangled (AME) state. We demonstrate this by confirming the $n$-independence of holographic $n$-th Renyi entropies for any bi-partite subsystems. Our result gives an AME state in an infinite-volume system, where the local bond dimension is set by the black hole entropy. In particular, our construction provides concrete support from the gravity side for the emergence of random structures and an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space in recent non-isometric holographic codes.
