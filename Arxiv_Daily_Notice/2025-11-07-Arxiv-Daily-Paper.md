#### Photon Orbit Signatures in Spectra of Black Hole Accretion Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Light orbiting an accreting black hole may impact the disk or jet multiple times before escaping to the observer, at a variety of angles with respect to the local magnetic field. In this letter, we characterize the imprints of these long path lengths and disparate magnetic field impacts in synchrotron spectra of hot accretion disks, as the strongly lensed ``photon ring'' exhibits a higher synchrotron turnover frequency in each lensed sub-image. We apply tools of varying complexity: first, we develop a minimal, unlensed one-zone model that isolates the first two sub-images of the accretion flow. By varying the magnetic field geometry encountered by each sub-image, we show that distinctive spectral signatures emerge in both total intensity and fractional linear polarization. Second, we examine a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model, in which we find that there is generally a frequency at which the first indirect image outshines the direct image even in total flux density. Lastly, we demonstrate that even general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation snapshots show this spectral character. We find a typical correction to the unresolved spectrum of order $10\%$ near the turnover frequency that grows with increasing viewing inclination, growing to order unity at higher frequencies. We predict sensitive spectral studies of the cores of Messier 87* and Sagittarius A* at frequencies exceeding $300$ GHz to constrain the existence of the photon ring even without imaging, with prospects for photon ring detection even in other sources with unresolved shadows.

#### Low redshift observational constraints on dark energy models using ANN - CosmicANNEstimator

 - **Abstract**
 We present CosmicANNEstimator (Cosmological Parameters Artificial Neural Network Estimator), a machine learning approach for constraining cosmological parameters within the Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) framework. Our methodology employs two specialized artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed to analyze Hubble parameter and Supernova data independently. The estimator is trained on synthetic data covering broad parameter ranges, with Gaussian random noise incorporated to simulate observational uncertainties. Our results demonstrate parameter estimates and associated uncertainties comparable to traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, establishing machine learning as an efficient alternative for cosmological parameter estimation. This work underscores the potential of neural network-based inference to complement traditional Bayesian methods and accelerate future cosmological analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Some of the first stars in the Universe might be powered by Dark Matter (DM) annihilations, rather than nuclear fusion. Those objects, i.e. Dark stars (DS), offer a unique window into understanding DM via the observational study of the formation and evolution of the first stars and their Black Hole (BH) remnants. In \cite{NNSMDSPhot} (Paper~I) we introduced a feedforward neural network (FFNN) trained on synthetic DS photometry in order to detect and characterize dark star {\it photometric} candidates in the early universe based on data taken with the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In this work we develop a FFNN trained on synthetic DS spectra in order to identify {\it spectroscopic} dark star candidates in the data taken with JWST's NIRSpec instrument. In order to validate our FFNN model we apply it to real data for the four spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS) candidates recently identified in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar} and reconfirm that indeed \JADESeleven, \JADESzthirteen, \JADESfz, and \JADESfo have spectra that are consistent with those of Supermassive Dark Stars. The main advantage of our FFNN model, in comparison to the Nedleaer-Mead Monte Carlo parameter estimator used in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}, is that the approach introduced here predicts parameters in milliseconds, over 10,000 times faster than the traditional method used in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}. With this in mind, the FFNN model we developed and validated in this work will be adapted for Bayesian uncertainty analyses and automatic analyses of NIRSpec publicly available data for high redshift objects. This study establishes a robust and efficient tool for probing Dark Stars and understanding their role in cosmic evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 A hierarchical three-body model can be widely applied to diverse astrophysical settings, from satellite-planet-star systems to binaries around supermassive black holes. The octupole-order perturbation on the inner binary from the tertiary can induce extreme eccentricities and cause orbital flips of the binary, but short-range forces such as those due to General Relativity (GR) may suppress extreme eccentricity excitations. In this paper, we consider restricted hierarchical three-body systems, where the inner binary has a test-mass component. We investigate the maximum possible eccentricity (called "limiting eccentricity") attainable by the inner binary under the influence of the tertiary perturbations and GR effect. In systems with sufficiently high hierarchy, the double averaging (DA) model is a good approximation; we show that the orbits which can flip under the octupole-order perturbation reach the same limiting eccentricity, which can be calculated analytically using the quadrupole-order Hamiltonian. In systems with moderate hierarchy, DA breaks down and the so-called Brown Hamiltonian is often introduced as a correction term; we show that this does not change the limiting eccentricity. Finally, we employ the single averaging (SA) model and find that the limiting eccentricity in the SA model is higher than the one in the DA model. We derive an analytical scaling for the modified limiting eccentricity in the SA model.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explain the recently reported a nHz-band gravitational-wave background from NANOGrav 15-year through the merger of binary super-massive black holes with masses of $10^9 M_{\odot}$ formed by the growth of primordial black holes. When a primordial black hole accretes at a high accretion rate, it emits a large number of high-energy photons. These heat the plasma, causing high-redshift cosmological 21cm line emission. Since this has not been detected, there is a strict upper bound on the accretion rate. We have found that with the primordial black hole abundance $10^{-14} \lesssim f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-12}$ and the mass $1 M_{\odot} \lesssim m_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^3 M_{\odot}$, we successfully fit the nHz band gravitational wave background from NANOGrav 15-year while avoiding the 21 cm line emission. We propose that future observations of the gravitational wave background and the cosmological 21cm line can test this scenario.

#### Revealing an Oscillating and Contracting Compact Corona near the Event Horizon of the Supermassive Black Hole in 1ES 1927+654

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamic processes in the accretion flow near black holes produce X-ray flux variability, sometimes quasi-periodic. Determining its physical origin is key to mapping accretion geometry but remains unresolved. We perform a novel phase-resolved analysis on a newly discovered quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the active galactic nucleus 1ES 1927+654. For the first time in a supermassive black hole (SMBH), we detect a unique `U'-shaped QPO lag-energy spectrum and observe coronal spectral variability over the QPO phase. We find that the QPO is adequately explained by plasma resonant oscillations within a corona. Modeling of QPO spectral properties and reverberation mapping reveal that the corona is contracting and confined to only a few gravitational radii regions near the SMBH, consistent with theoretical predictions for a decreasing QPO period of near 10 minutes. These results present the first observational evidence for an oscillating and contracting compact corona around an SMBH.

#### Constraining gravity with the decay rate of cosmological gravitational potential
 - **Authors:** Xinyi Zhao, Pengjie Zhang, Fuyu Dong

 - **Abstract**
 A key task in cosmology is to test the validity of general relativity (GR) at cosmological scales and, therefore, to distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity (MG) as the driver of the late-time cosmic acceleration. The decay rate ($DR$) of cosmological gravitational potential, being sensitive to gravity and being immune to various astrophysical uncertainties, enables GR tests independent to other structure growth probes. Recently we have measured $DR$ at $0.2\leq z\leq 1.4$, combining the DR9 galaxy catalog from the DESI imaging surveys and Planck cosmic microwave background maps \citep{arXiv:2411.12594}. Here we use this measurement to test gravity, and restrict the analysis to one-parameter extensions to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We consider four one-parameter MG parameterizations. One is $f(a)=\Omega_m^\gamma(a)$. The other three adopt the gravitational slip parameter $\eta=1$ and consider variations in the effective gravitational constant $G_{\rm eff}/G$ with the parameterization $\Sigma(a)=\Sigma_\Lambda \Omega_\Lambda(a)/\Omega_\Lambda$, $\Sigma(a)=\Sigma_1 a$ or $\Sigma(a)=\Sigma_2 a^2$. We find $\gamma=0.47^{+0.22}_{-0.15}$, consistent with the GR prediction $\gamma\simeq 0.55$. We also find $\Sigma_\Lambda=0.018^{+0.052}_{-0.053}$, $\Sigma_1=0.020^{+0.065}_{-0.062}$, and $\Sigma_2=0.027^{+0.067}_{-0.069}$, fully consistent with the GR case of $\Sigma=0$, regardless of parameterizations of $\Sigma(a)$. The constraining power is already competitive, while a factor of 2 further improvement is expected for the upcoming full-sky galaxy surveys.

#### Study the nature of dynamical dark energy by measuring the CMB polarization rotation angle

 - **Abstract**
 Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) support the dynamical dark energy. Intriguingly, the data favor a transition of the dark energy equation of state across $w=-1$, a hallmark of the Quintom scenario. In this paper, we consider a different approach to the dynamical nature of dark energy by investigating its interaction with ordinary matters, specifically the Chern-Simons (CS) interaction with photons. In cosmology, this interaction rotates the polarized plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons, which induces non-zero polarized TB and EB power spectra. We forecast this measurement with the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT) experiment. We take the best-fit value of the isotropic rotation angle from Planck data as our fiducial input. We project that 11 module-year (modyr) of observations will yield an improved detection sensitivity with a significance $\sim 5\sigma$, given a calibration precision of $0.1^\circ$ in the polarization angle. We also forecast AliCPT's sensitivity to the amplitude of a scale invariant spectrum of the anisotropic polarization rotation field. With $50$~modyr of observations, the large-aperture configuration is expected to reach $\sigma_{A_{\mathrm{CB}}}\sim10^{-2}$, offering a sixfold improvement over the small-aperture design and enabling competitive tests of spatial fluctuations in the dark energy field.

#### Addressing the DESI DR2 Phantom-Crossing Anomaly and Enhanced $H_0$ Tension with Reconstructed Scalar-Tensor Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological data, including DESI DR2, highlight significant tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. When analyzed in the context of General Relativity (GR), the latest DESI data favor a dynamical dark energy (DDE) equation of state, $w(z)$, that crosses the phantom divide line $w=-1$. However, this framework prefers a lower Hubble constant, $H_0$, than Planck 2018, thereby worsening the tension with local measurements. This phantom crossing is a key feature that cannot be achieved by minimally coupled scalar fields (quintessence) within GR. This suggests the need for a new degree of freedom that can simultaneously: (A) increase the best-fit value of $H_0$ in the context of the DESI DR2 data, and (B) allow the crossing of the $w=-1$ line within a new theoretical approach. We argue that both of these goals may be achieved in the context of Modified Gravity (MG), and in particular, Scalar-Tensor (ST) theories, where phantom crossing is a natural and viable feature. We demonstrate these facts by analyzing a joint dataset including DESI DR2, Pantheon+, CMB, and growth-rate (RSD) data in the context of simple parametrizations for the effective gravitational constant, $\mu_G(z) \equiv G_{eff}/G_N$, and the DDE equation of state, $w(z)$. This MG framework significantly alleviates the tension, leading to a higher inferred value of $H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.7 \, \text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$. We also present a systematic, data-driven reconstruction of the required underlying ST Lagrangian and provide simple, generic analytical expressions for both the non-minimal coupling $F(\Phi) = 1+\xi\Phi^{2}e^{n\Phi}$ and the scalar potential $U(\Phi) = U_{0}+ae^{b\Phi^{2}}$, which well-describe the reconstructed functions.

#### KGB-evolution: a relativistic $N$-body code for kinetic gravity braiding models

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04676

 - **Abstract**
 We present KGB-evolution, a relativistic $N$-body simulation code that extends the $k$-evolution code by incorporating an effective field theory parameterization of kinetic gravity braiding, while also including the $k$-essence model as a limiting case. As a first step, we implement the linearized dark energy stress-energy tensor and scalar field equations, providing the groundwork for a future full Horndeski theory extension. We validate KGB-evolution by comparing its power spectra against linear predictions from hi$\_$class, finding excellent agreement on large scales at low redshifts and over all scales at high redshifts. We demonstrate that nonlinear growth of matter and metric perturbations on small scales drives the linearized dark energy field into a nonlinear clustering regime, which in turn feeds back on the growth of cosmic structure. In contrast to the $k$-essence limit, a nonzero braiding considerably amplifies this backreaction, producing a significantly stronger alteration of structure formation in the kinetic gravity braiding model.

 - **Abstract**
 Data-driven approaches using deep learning are emerging as powerful techniques to extract non-Gaussian information from cosmological large-scale structure. This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI) pipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for a forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model based on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one million self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level. Leveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural networks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn low-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with target parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation of the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter space spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias parameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear bias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference pipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic contaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs. Our forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter constraints, achieving $2-3\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\Omega_m - S_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and effectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These results demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for upcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys.

#### Ringdown modulation of acceleration radiation in the Schwarzschild background

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03766

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analytic, first-order description of how black hole ringdown imprints on the operational signature of near-horizon thermality. Building on a static Schwarzschild baseline in which a freely falling two-level system coupled to a single outgoing mode exhibits geometric photon statistics and a detailed-balance ratio set by the surface gravity, we introduce an even-parity, axisymmetric quadrupolar perturbation and work in an ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein, horizon-regular framework. The perturbation corrects the outgoing eikonal through a gauge-invariant double-null contraction of the metric, yielding a compact redshift map that, when pulled back to the detector worldline, produces a universal, decaying-oscillatory modulation of the Boltzmann exponent at the quasinormal frequency. We derive a closed boundary formula for the response coefficient at the sampling radius, identify the precise adiabatic window in which the result holds, and prove that the modulation vanishes in all stationary limits. Detector specifics (gap, switching wavepacket width) enter only through a smooth prefactor, while the geometric content is captured by the quasinormal pair and the response coefficient. The analysis clarifies that near-horizon "thermality" is robust but not rigid: detailed balance persists as the organizing structure and is gently driven by ringdown dynamics. The framework is minimal yet extensible to other multipoles, parities, and slow rotation, and it suggests direct numerical and experimental cross-checks in controlled analog settings.

#### Boson Stars Hosting Black Holes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03788

 - **Abstract**
 We study a system of a self-gravitating condensate, a boson star, formed from scalar ultra-light dark matter (ULDM), with a black hole hosted at its center. We numerically solve the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium in the non-relativistic limit, consistently incorporating the gravitational potential of the black hole, to obtain all possible configurations of this BS-BH system for different boson star masses, interaction types, and black hole masses. We also propose an analytic expression for the density profile and compare it with the numerical results, finding good agreement for attractive interactions and for a finite range of mass ratios between the black hole and boson star. Finally, considering the inspiral of this BS-BH system with a second, smaller black hole, we study the dephasing of gravitational waves due to the presence of the ULDM environment. A Fisher matrix analysis reveals the regions of parameter space of the ULDM mass and self-coupling that future gravitational-wave observatories such as LISA can probe.

 - **Abstract**
 The horizon-scale images of supermassive black holes (BHs) by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHT) have provided new opportunities to test general relativity and other theories of gravity. In view of future projects, such as the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and the Black-Hole Explorer (BHEX), having the potential of enhancing our ability to probe extreme gravity, it is natural to ask: \textit{how much can two black-hole images differ?} To address this question and assess the ability of these projects to test theories of gravity with black-hole shadows, we use general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic and radiative-transfer simulations to investigate the images of a wide class of accreting BHs deviating from the Kerr solution. By measuring the mismatch between images of different BHs we show that future missions will be able to distinguish a large class of BHs solutions from the Kerr solution when the mismatch in the images exceeds values between $2\%$ and $5\%$ depending on the image-comparison metric considered. These results indicate future horizon-scale imaging with percent-level image fidelity can place meaningful observational constraints on deviations from the Kerr metric and thereby test strong-field predictions of general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 We identify a general class of spacetime metrics that mimic the properties of black holes without possessing a true event horizon. These metrics are constrained by the requirements of being singularity-free and geodesically complete. Specifically, we study metrics that do not possess $Z_2$ symmetry and may deviate slightly or significantly from the symmetric case. Focusing on scalar perturbations propagating on such backgrounds, we analyze the resulting effective radial potentials and their dependence on different corners of the mimicker landscape. We further investigate the corresponding quasinormal modes and explore their characteristic features. Finally, we survey the landscape for potential observational signatures, including shadow properties and the possible presence or absence of echo effects.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore charged black holes in Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG), unveiling their distinctive features across multiple physical domains. Our topological analysis reveals that the STVG coupling parameter $\alpha$ bolsters thermal stability while electromagnetic charge $Q$ weakens it. Using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we find that $\alpha$ amplifies light deflection and enlarges shadow silhouettes, with $Q$ generating opposite effects. Our quantum-corrected models with exponential entropy terms pinpoint phase transitions in the microscopic regime, modifying conventional thermodynamic relationships. Calculations of strong gravitational lensing, shadow geometry, and Hawking emission show clear STVG signatures that diverge from Einstein's predictions. Notably, our accretion disk analysis uncovers an intriguing phenomenon: specific combinations of $\alpha$ and $Q$ can produce radiation patterns resembling spinning Kerr black holes, creating potential identification challenges for observers. These findings establish concrete observational tests for STVG theory through next generation astronomical imaging and lensing campaigns. By connecting theoretical predictions to measurable quantities, we outline specific pathways to confirm or constrain STVG using data from current and future space telescopes.

#### Apparent horizon as a membrane

 - **Abstract**
 The requirement that a trapped spacetime domain forms in finite time for distant observers is logically possible and sometimes unavoidable, but its consequences are not yet fully understood. In spherical symmetry, the characterization of the near-horizon geometry of these physical black holes is complete and shows marked differences from their eternal counterparts. Whether these differences lead to observable signatures remains unclear. We construct an approximate near-horizon metric that encapsulates them and is suitable for modeling. The timelike apparent horizon of physical black holes provides a natural surface for a consistent membrane description: we obtain closed-form expressions for the redshift, proper acceleration, and extrinsic curvature, and assign a two-dimensional viscous-fluid stress tensor via junction conditions. These results also provide an additional perspective on the relation between Rindler and near-horizon geometries. Among dynamical generalizations of surface gravity, only a subset applies to these models. We complete their analysis and recover the intuitive definition of surface gravity -- the acceleration in the frame of a near-horizon observer, redshifted to infinity -- directly from the membrane acceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 We numerically investigate the superradiant amplification effect of a charged scalar filed in the scattering experiment and the black hole bomb model in a charged black-bounce spacetime. Due to the shallowing effect on the effective potential by the introduced quantum parameter $ł$, superradiance in both the above cases are verified to be weakened. In a scattering experiment, the quantum parameter and the field mass suppress the amplification in all frequency ranges, while the black hole and field charge influence it differently in high and low frequencies. In a Type I black hole bomb model, where the reflective mirror is placed outside the ergo-region, we find a new distinct eigen-mode for the scalar field evolution in a high $ł$ value, which is however absent in the case of Type II black bomb where the mirror is set inside the ergo-region. Moreover, we investigate the heavy field mass scenario in a Type II black hole bomb and find no amplification effect in this confined configuration.

 - **Abstract**
 According to General Relativity (GR), gravitational waves (GWs) should travel at the speed of light $c$. However, some theories beyond GR predict deviations of the velocity of GWs $c_{\rm gw}$ from $c$, and some of those expect vacuum dispersion. Therefore, probing the propagation effects of GWs by comparing the wave format detectors against the one at emission excepted from GR. Since such propagation effects accumulate through larger distance, it is expected that super-massive black holes binary (SMBHB) mergers serve as better targets than their stellarmass equivalent. In this paper, we study with simulations on how observations on a population of SMBHs can help to study this topic. We simulate LISA observations on three possible SMBHB merger populations, namely Pop\MakeUppercase{\romannumeral 3}, Q3-nod and Q3-d over a 5-year mission. The resulting constraints on the graviton mass are \(9.50\), \(9.33\), and \(9.05 \times 10^{-27} \, \mathrm{eV}/c^2\), respectively. We also obtain the corresponding constraints on the dispersion coefficients assuming different dispersion scenarios. If the electromagnetic wave counterparts of SMBHB merger can be detected simultaneously, the $c_{\rm gw}$ can be constrained waveform-independently to \(\Delta c/c\) to \(10^{-13}-10^{-12}\), corresponding to graviton mass constraints of \(10^{-26}-10^{-24} \mathrm{eV}/c^2\).

 - **Abstract**
 It is widely believed that Sgr A$^*$, located at the center of our Galaxy, is a supermassive black hole. Recent observations of its shadow and long-term monitoring of the S2 star have provided compelling evidence supporting this hypothesis. These observational advancements also offer valuable opportunities to explore the physical properties of the black hole and its surrounding environment. Since a dark matter halo is expected to exist in the Milky Way and around Sgr A$^*$, investigating the behavior of the Galactic Center black hole embedded in such a halo provides a crucial means to simultaneously probe both black hole physics and dark matter properties. In this work, We develop a black hole metric that incorporates a generalized double power law dark matter halo, and analyze the corresponding null and timelike geodesics to investigate how the halo parameters affect the black hole shadow and the motion of the S2 star. Furthermore, by comparing our theoretical predictions with observational data of the shadow and the S2 orbit, we constrained the dark matter halo parameters. The results of this study provide both theoretical and phenomenological insights into the nature of Sgr A$^*$ and the distribution of dark matter in our Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The deep connection between black hole thermodynamics and spacetime geometry remains a central focus of general relativity. While recent studies have revealed a precise correspondence for null orbits, given by $K = -\lambda^2$ between the Gaussian curvature $K$ and the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$, its validity for timelike orbits had remained unknown. Our work introduces the massive particle surface (MPS) framework and constructs a new geometric quantity $\mathcal{G}$. We demonstrate that $\mathcal{G} \propto -\lambda^2$ on unstable timelike orbits, thus establishing the geometry-dynamics correspondence for massive particles. Crucially, near the first-order phase transition of a black hole, $\mathcal{G}$ displays synchronized multivalued behavior with the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ and yields a critical exponent $\delta=1/2$. Our results demonstrate that spacetime geometry encodes thermodynamic information, opening a new pathway for studying black hole phase transitions from a geometric perspective.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a general formalism linking modified entropy functions directly to a modified spacetime metric and, subsequently, to an effective matter sector of entropic origin. In particular, within the framework of general relativity, starting from the first law of black-hole thermodynamics we establish an explicit correspondence between the entropy derivative and the metric function, which naturally leads to an emergent stress-energy tensor representing an anisotropic effective fluid. This backreaction effect of horizon entropy may resolve possible inconsistencies recently identified in black hole physics with modified entropies. As specific examples, we apply this procedure to a wide class of modified entropies, such as Barrow, Tsallis-Cirto, Renyi, Kaniadakis, logarithmic, power-law, loop-quantum-gravity, and exponential modifications, and we derive the associated effective matter sectors, analyzing their physical properties and energy conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Finslerian extensions of Special and General Relativity -- commonly referred to as Very Special and Very General Relativity -- necessitate the development of a unified Lorentz-Finsler geometry. However, the scope of this geometric framework extends well beyond relativistic physics. Indeed, it offers powerful tools for modeling wave propagation in classical mechanics, discretizing spacetimes in classical and relativistic settings, and supporting effective theories in fundamental physics. Moreover, Lorentz-Finsler geometry provides a versatile setting that facilitates the resolution of problems within Riemannian, Lorentzian, and Finslerian geometries individually. This work presents a plain introduction to the subject, reviewing foundational concepts, key applications, and future prospects. The reviewed topics include (i) basics on the setting of cones, Finsler and Lorentz-Finsler metrics and their (nonlinear, anisotropic and linear) connections, (ii) the global structure of Lorentz-Finsler manifolds and its space of null geodesics, (iii) links among Riemannian, Finsler and Lorentz geometries, (iv) real world applications for wildfires and seisms, and discretization in classical and relativistic settings with quantum prospects, and (v) Finslerian variational approach to Einstein equations. The new results include the splitting of globally hyperbolic Finsler spacetimes, in addition to the analysis of several extensions as the case of timelike boundaries.

#### Twist and higher modes of a complex scalar field at the threshold of collapse

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the threshold of collapse of a massless complex scalar field in axisymmetric spacetimes under the ansatz of Choptuik et al. 2004, in which a symmetry depending on the azimuthal parameter $m$ is imposed on the scalar field. This allows for both non-vanishing twist and angular momentum. We extend earlier work to include higher angular modes. Using the pseudospectral code bamps with a new adapted symmetry reduction method, which we call $m$-cartoon, and a generalized twist-compatible apparent horizon finder, we evolve near-critical initial data to the verge of black hole formation for the lowest nontrivial modes, $m=1$ and $m=2$. For $m=1$ we recover discrete self-similarity with echoing period $\Delta\simeq0.42$ and power-law scaling with exponent $\gamma\simeq0.11$, consistent with earlier work. For $m=2$ we find that universality is maintained within this nonzero fixed-$m$ symmetry class but with smaller period and critical exponents, $\Delta\simeq0.09$ and $\gamma\simeq0.035$, establishing an explicit dependence of the critical solution on the angular mode. Analysis of the relation between the angular momentum and the mass of apparent horizons at the instant of formation, $J_{\mathrm{AH}}{-}M_{\mathrm{AH}}$, shows that the effect of angular momentum is minimal at the threshold, with $\chi_{\mathrm{AH}}=J_{\mathrm{AH}}/M_{\mathrm{AH}}^2\to0$, and, therefore, excludes extremal black holes for the families under consideration. Our results demonstrate that while universality and DSS hold within each $m$-sector, the critical universal values vary with $m$, and neither extremality nor bifurcation occur in the complex scalar field model within the families considered here.

 - **Abstract**
 Scalar fields with a global U(1) symmetry often appear in cosmology and astrophysics. We study the spherically-symmetric, stationary accretion of such a classical field onto a Schwarzschild black hole in the test-field approximation. Thus, we consider the relativistic Bondi accretion beyond a simplified perfect-fluid setup. We focus on the complex scalar field with canonical kinetic term and with a generic quartic potential which either preserves the U(1) symmetry or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is well known that in the lowest order in gradient expansion the dynamics of such a scalar field is well approximated by a perfect superfluid; we demonstrate that going beyond this approximation systematically reduces the accretion rate with respect to the perfect fluid case. Hence, black holes can provide a way to distinguish a perfect fluid from its ultraviolet completion in form of the complex scalar field.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe a holographic mechanism for black hole formation via the collision of two shockwaves in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. In the dual conformal field theory (CFT), a two-shockwave state corresponds to the insertion of two boosted precursor operators in complementary Rindler patches. Their operator product expansion is initially described by a universal mean field spectrum of exchanged states, which is dominated by operator dimensions that grow exponentially in the boost parameter. We propose their mean value as diagnosing the mass of the collision product in the bulk. It crosses the CFT heavy state threshold after two scrambling times, in accordance with expectations about black hole formation in general relativity. Our analysis also allows us to identify the scrambling characteristics usually associated with out-of-time-order correlation functions, using only the internal composition of thermal in-time-order correlators.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the long-standing puzzles in string theory has been on the existence of a four-dimensional de Sitter and quasi de Sitter configurations, the latter being defined with a temporally varying dark energy, in E_8 x E_8 and SO(32) heterotic theories. In this work, novel dynamical duality-sequences are devised that provide natural constructions of de Sitter and quasi de Sitter excited states in the aforementioned theories allowing no late-time singularities. The emergent positive dark energies -- including the intriguing possibility of their slow temporal variations -- appear from Borel resumming Gevrey series from the path-integral representations of such states. Additionally, precise ways to handle the equations of motion, Bianchi identities, flux quantizations and anomaly cancellations -- consistent with the underlying axionic cosmology and with the probability of forming wormholes that connect baby universes -- are presented for the SO(32) and the E_8 x E_8 theories within a framework that systematically incorporates perturbative and non-perturbative corrections in the far infrared. The temporally varying dark energy, which is much more natural in our set-up because of its emergent nature, surprisingly simplifies many of the aforementioned computations. Interestingly, our analysis also provides, probably for the first time, a set-up to consistently embed four-dimensional standard model degrees of freedom at late time in a realistic gravitational background with positive dark energy from string theory.

 - **Abstract**
 The thermodynamics of de Sitter black holes is complicated by the presence of two horizons and the absence of a globally defined timelike Killing vector. The standard choice of the Gibbons-Hawking Killing vector is at odds with the interpretation of the surface gravity as an acceleration measured by a physical observer at rest. Focusing on four-dimensional Reissner-Nordström de Sitter black holes we show that this issue can be resolved by adopting a normalization originally proposed by Bousso and Hawking, which defines thermodynamic quantities relative to the unique freely-falling observer at a fixed radial coordinate. Within this framework, we derive new first laws for the black hole and cosmological horizon and re-examine the black hole's heat capacity. We find that the heat capacity remains finite in the near-extremal Nariai limit, thus averting a breakdown of the semi-classical thermodynamic description. However, the heat capacity does vanish in the cold limit, as expected, and for Nariai black holes in the ultracold limit, indicating that fundamental limitations on the statistical description persist in these regimes. We discuss the implications of our results for log-$T$ corrections to near-extremal de Sitter black holes.

#### The Quantum Vacuum Self-Consistency Principle: Emergent Dynamics of Spacetime and the Standard Model

 - **Abstract**
 The principle of self-consistency of the quantum vacuum postulates that the classical backgrounds we observe -- spacetime, gauge fields, and the Higgs condensate -- are macroscopic order parameters of a single quantum state sustained by its own fluctuations. Building on this postulate, a background-field, heat-kernel based derivation is developed that yields the coupled low-energy effective field equations for the metric, gauge, and Higgs fields as vacuum "equations of state." The framework rigorously recovers the Einstein, Yang-Mills, and Higgs equations, augmented by the higher-derivative operators required by quantum consistency. Phenomenological consequences follow. First, the anomaly- and loop-induced R^2 operator generically drives Starobinsky-type inflation, compatible with Planck data. Second, the universally calculable quantum correction to Newton's potential and the Yukawa tails from massive spin-0 and spin-2 modes are quantified and shown to satisfy laboratory bounds. Third, constraints from GW170817 enforce luminal gravitational wave speed. The theory is predictive in its inflationary sector and in its universal low-energy corrections to gravity, reducing to General Relativity and the Standard Model at accessible scales with controlled corrections.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a family of exact neutral hairy black-hole solutions with spherical horizon topology in extended supergravity with Fayet--Iliopoulos terms. We consider a consistent dilaton truncation and analyze in detail a sector where the magnetic part of the FI terms vanishes. Using appropriate dilaton counterterms, we compute the thermodynamic quantities and show the existence of Hawking--Page phase transitions. As a holographic application, we derive the thermal superpotential in closed form and use it as a counterterm, explicitly demonstrating that no additional finite counterterms are required to regularize the Euclidean action and the quasi-local stress tensor. The dual stress tensor matches that of a thermal gas of massless particles and is consistent with mixed dilaton boundary conditions that preserve conformal symmetry.
