 - **Abstract**
 JWST's "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) are increasingly interpreted as active galactic nuclei (AGN) obscured by dense thermalized gas rather than dust as evidenced by their X-ray weakness, blackbody-like continua, and Balmer line profiles. A key question is how LRDs connect to standard UV-luminous AGN and whether transitional phases exist and if they are observable. We present the "X-Ray Dot" (XRD), a compact source at $z=3.28$ observed by the NIRSpec WIDE GTO survey. The XRD exhibits LRD hallmarks: a blackbody-like ($T_{\rm eff} \simeq 6400\,$K) red continuum, a faint but blue rest-UV excess, falling mid-IR emission, and broad Balmer lines ($\rm FWHM \sim 2700-3200\,km\,s^{-1}$). Unlike LRDs, however, it is remarkably X-ray luminous ($L_\textrm{2$-$10$\,$keV} = 10^{44.18}\,$erg$\,$s$^{-1}$) and has a continuum inflection that is bluewards of the Balmer limit. We find that the red rest-optical and blue mid-IR continuum cannot be reproduced by standard dust-attenuated AGN models without invoking extremely steep extinction curves, nor can the weak mid-IR emission be reconciled with well-established X-ray--torus scaling relations. We therefore consider an alternative scenario: the XRD may be an LRD in transition, where the gas envelope dominates the optical continuum but optically thin sightlines allow X-rays to escape. The XRD may thus provide a physical link between LRDs and standard AGN, offering direct evidence that LRDs are powered by supermassive black holes and providing insight into their accretion properties.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way's Galactic Center hosts the black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), which provides us with a close-up view into supermassive black hole accretion and feedback. Recent works have shown that the winds from $\sim 30$ Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars orbiting Sgr A* at about 4 arcsec are important contributors to feeding the supermassive black hole. A nuclear star cluster (NSC) with a mass of several $10^6 \, \text{M}_\odot$, of which $10^6 \, \text{M}_\odot$ is within 1 pc, also surrounds Sgr A*. The NSC contributes to the gravitational potential in the Galactic Center, affecting the orbits of the WR stars and their stellar winds. In this work, we examine the effects that the NSC has on the accretion of these stellar winds onto Sgr A* which have previously been neglected. We find that, on the parsec scale, the effect from the gravitational potential of the NSC is negligible on the wind-fed accretion flow, validating the existing simulations used in the literature.

#### Dark energy driven by an oscillating generalised axion-like quintessence field

 - **Abstract**
 Generalised axion-like scalar fields provide a well-motivated framework for describing the late-time acceleration of the Universe. As the field evolves, it rolls down its potential and, depending on its mass and initial conditions, it may either still be approaching the minimum or already oscillating around it. These two dynamical regimes require distinct treatments of cosmological perturbations. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of linear cosmological perturbations in the regime where the dark-energy scalar field undergoes coherent oscillations about the minimum of its potential. We show that the standard effective fluid description breaks down in this phase and develop a consistent field-based perturbation framework, which we use to assess the impact of oscillatory dark energy on the growth of cosmic structures.

 - **Abstract**
 The apsidal motion of a non-synchronous binary pulsar serves as a valuable probe of relativistic gravity, stellar stricture, and dynamical evolution of close binary systems, In this study, we investigate the combined influence of general relativity, stellar oblateness and tidal interaction on the apsidal motion of three binary pulsars: 1913+16, J0737-3039A/B, and J0621+1002. Zahn's tidal equations \cite{1977A&A....57..383Z, 1989A&A...220..112Z} were employed for numerical integrations to describe tidal effects and their role in orbital and spin evolution. We estimated the timescales for tidal synchronization and orbital circularization for each system. The results indicate that tidal effects play only a minor role in orbital decay compared with energy loss due to gravitational wave emission. This is evident in the compact system PSR 1913+16, where the orbital period decreases by approximately 76.5 $\mu$s/yr as a result of gravitational radiation. The double pulsar J0737-3039A/B exhibits faster orbital evolution, with synchronization occurring in about 8.4$\times10{^3}$ years, whereas the wider system J0621+1002 shows negligible orbital change over timescales exceeding 10$^{10}$ years. The simulations demonstrate clear trends of decreasing semi-major axis and eccentricity, accompanied by an increase in spin rate among the binary pulsars studied. The derived apsidal motion constants [$k\simeq0.1$] are consistent with theoretical expected values, and the corresponding tidal friction times (between a few hours to several days) agree well with theoretical predication. These results emphasize the dominant role of relativistic effects in neutron star binaries and highlight the importance of including gravitational-wave terms long-term orbital evolution

 - **Abstract**
 Building on the transformative success of optical redshift surveys, the emerging technique of neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping (IM) offers a novel probe of large-scale structure (LSS) growth and the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe. We present cosmological forecasts for the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations (BINGO), a pioneering HI IM experiment, quantifying its potential to constrain the \textit{Planck}-calibrated $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and extensions to the $w_0w_a$CDM dark energy model. For BINGO's Phase~1 configuration, we simulate the HI IM signal using a lognormal model and incorporate three dominant systematics: foreground residuals, thermal noise, and beam resolution effects. Using Bayesian inference, we derive joint constraints on six cosmological parameters ($\Omega_b h^2$, $\Omega_c h^2$, $100\theta_s$, $n_s$, $\ln 10^{10} A_s$, and $\tau_r$) alongside 60 HI parameters ($b_{\rm HI}^i$, $\Omega_{\rm HI}^i b_{\rm HI}^i$) across 30 frequency channels. Our results demonstrate that combining BINGO with the Planck 2018 CMB dataset tightens the confidence regions of cosmological parameters to $\sim$40\% the size of those from Planck alone, significantly improving the precision of parameter estimation. Furthermore, BINGO constrains the redshift evolution of HI density and delivers competitive measurements of the dark energy equation of state parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$). These results demonstrate BINGO's potential to extract significant cosmological information from the HI distribution and provide constraints competitive with current and future cosmological surveys.

#### Effect of Primordial Black Holes on the global 21-cm signal

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm global signal, a treasure trove of information about the nature of the first luminous sources of the Universe, has traditionally been modelled assuming that these early sources were predominantly star-forming galaxies. However, recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed several AGNs as early as z ~ 10 - 10.4 . In light of this, it is important to investigate the contribution of such AGNs to the 21-cm signal. Assuming that these AGNs are seeded by Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and employing an analytical PBH model, consistent with existing cosmological and astrophysical constraints, we show that these exotic objects can have a significant impact on the redshift evolution of the global signal.

#### Extracting intrinsic alignments in the Dark Energy Survey's year 1 data, using the self-calibration method and LSST-DESC tools

 - **Abstract**
 We present the implementation of a Self-Calibration of Intrinsic Alignments of galaxies as an extension to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC)'s weak lensing 3x2pt pipeline (TXPipe). As a demonstration, we have run this pipeline on the Dark Energy Survey (DES) year one data set. We find indications of a non-zero intrinsic alignment signal in the higher redshift bins, while in the lower bins our results look more uncertain. We believe this is caused by known issues with the individual galaxies photo-z estimation. This effect is particularly harmful for the self-calibration method, since it has high requirements for reliable estimation of the photo-$z$s, and the need for individual galaxy point estimates and tomographic binning to match. We show how different methods of recreating the redshift probability distribution can affect the detection of intrinsic alignment.

#### Active Galactic Nuclei and STaR fOrmation in Nearby Galaxies (AGNSTRONG). II: Results for Jetted Type-I AGNs with Strong Ionized Gas Outflows

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the correlation between ionized gas outflows, jets, and star formation in a sample of 42 local type-I active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibiting significant [O III] outflows. This study uses both new submillimeter (sub-mm) observations and archival data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Our analysis, which includes a correction for jet emission in the sub-mm bands, fitting spectral energy distribution, and analyzing spectra, enables us to derive star-formation rates (SFRs) through various methods. By comparing radio power and SFRs, we select a sub-sample of jetted AGNs of which radio emission is mostly from the jets. We find that jetted AGNs predominantly lie above the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, suggesting a correlation between jet activity and star formation. By comparing dust extinction, we demonstrate that jetted AGNs do not have more dust which is the fuel of both star formation and AGN activity. Therefore, this correlation is more likely to arise from AGN feedback. We also find that the Eddington ratio does not impact the specific SFRs (sSFRs) of our sample. Additionally, for jetted AGNs, stronger radio emission corresponds to higher sSFRs, suggesting that jet emission may promote star formation, i.e., positive feedback. Our results not only shed light on the feedback mechanisms of AGNs but also underscore the complex interplay between black hole activity and star formation in galaxy evolution.

#### Origins of the UV continuum and Balmer emission lines in Little Red Dots: observational validation of dense gas envelope models enshrouding the AGN

 - **Abstract**
 We present a statistical study on the origins of the UV continuum and narrow/broad emission lines in little red dots (LRDs), a newly discovered class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Leveraging all archived JWST/NIRSpec data, we build a sample of 28 spectroscopically-confirmed LRDs at $5<z_{\rm spec}<7.2$, by requiring broad H$\alpha$ emission, blue UV colors, V-shaped continua, and compact morphologies. We define a control sample of 9 blue, compact, broad-line AGNs without red optical continua (hereafter little blue dots; LBDs), and examine correlations between rest UV and the narrow/broad H$\alpha$ luminosities in these populations. In LRDs, both narrow and broad H$\alpha$ components are tightly correlated with the UV continuum, and the luminosity ratios are consistent with those in young starburst galaxies. In contrast, the UV to broad H$\alpha$ ratios in LBDs closely match local unobscured AGNs and are statistically different from LRDs. The Ly$\alpha$ occurrence rates and strengths do not differ between LRDs and LBDs and are comparable to normal star-forming galaxies. These results are consistent with a scenario where the central BH in LRDs is enshrouded by a dense opaque gas envelope -- in this model, the UV continuum as well as narrow and even broad H$\alpha$ emissions are not powered by AGNs but predominantly by young massive stars surrounding the envelope, while the envelope radiates as a $\sim 5000$ K blackbody. As the envelope dissipates, direct AGN emission can emerge, potentially transforming LRDs into LBDs and marking the end of a short-lived phase of rapid black hole growth.

#### Late-time acceleration without a vacuum term in ${f(R,L_m)}$ gravity: scaling deSitter dynamics and parameter constraints

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.10699

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate late-time cosmic acceleration in $f(R,L_m)$ gravity driven by nonlinear matter contributions, focusing on the class $f(R,L_m)=R/2+c_1 L_m+c_n L_m^{n}+c_0$ with the explicit choice $L_m=\rho_m$ and an uncoupled radiation sector. We analyze two realizations: (i) Case A: $f(R,L_m)=R/2+\beta \rho_m^{n}+\gamma$, where $\gamma$ acts as a vacuum term, and (ii) Case B: $f(R,L_m)=R/2+\beta \rho_m+\gamma \rho_m^{n}$, where the nonlinear sector can mimic dark energy without an explicit cosmological constant. For each case, we construct a bounded autonomous system, classify all critical points and their stability, and compute cosmographic diagnostics. The phase-space analysis shows that Case A reproduces the standard radiation$\to$matter$\to$de~Sitter sequence only for $n\gtrsim 4/5$, with acceleration essentially enforced by the vacuum term. In contrast, Case~B admits a qualitatively distinct and phenomenologically appealing branch: for $0<n<1/2$ the system possesses a physical \emph{scaling} de~Sitter future attractor inside the bounded simplex, yielding radiation$\to$matter$\to$acceleration with $q=-1$ and $\omega_{\rm eff}=-1$ and without introducing $c_0$. We confront both models with background data (CC, Union3, DESI BAO, plus a BBN prior on $\Omega_b h^2$) using nested sampling and perform model comparison via Bayesian evidence and AIC/BIC. The full data combination constrains $n=1.08\pm0.05$ in Case A and $n=0.05\pm0.10$ in Case B (68\% CL), the latter lying within the accelerating window while remaining statistically consistent with $\Lambda$CDM kinematics at the background level. We also record minimal consistency conditions for stability (tensor no-ghost and luminal propagation) and motivate a dedicated perturbation-level analysis as the next step to test growth and lensing observables.

#### Quantum Optical Inspired Models for Unitary Black Hole Evaporation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.09820

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we describe optically inspired models for unitary black hole (BH) evaporation. The goal of these models are (i) to be operationally simple, (ii) approximately preserve the thermal nature of the emitted Hawking Radiation (HR), and (iii) attempt to reproduce the Page Curve that purports that information flows forth from the BH when it has evaporated to approximately half its initial mass. We concentrate on modeling the BH as a single mode squeezed state successively interacting, by means of beam splitters and squeezers, with vacuum modes near the horizon, giving rise to entangled pairs representing the external Hawking radiation and its partner particle inside the horizon. Since all states and operations are Gaussian throughout, we use a symplectic formalism to track the evolution of the composite system through the evolving means and variances of their quadrature operators. This allows us to easily compute correlations and entanglement between the BH and the HR, as well as calculate correlations between the BH at early and late times.

#### Non-Monotonic Enhancement of the Magnetic Penrose Process in Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Spacetime and its Implication for Electron Acceleration

 - **Abstract**
 We studied the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (KBR) spacetime, an exact rotating electrovacuum solution describing a black hole (BH) immersed in an intrinsic, uniform electromagnetic field. We analyze the behavior of charged particles in this geometry and find that the spacetime structure itself responds non-monotonically to the background magnetic field $B$. Specifically, both the event horizon and the static limit surface first expand as $B$ increases, reach a maximum size at an intermediate field strength, and then contract toward the extremal limit. Although the ergoregion itself shrinks monotonically with $B$, this structural feature gives rise to a pronounced non-monotonic dependence of the energy extraction efficiency on the magnetic field $B$, i.e., the efficiency initially rises, attains a maximum value, and subsequently falls as the extremal condition is approached. This contrasts sharply with the monotonic trends usually associated with magnetic enhancements in the Kerr geometry. We further explore an astrophysical application of the MPP by estimating the maximum energy of electrons escaping from the ergoregion of the KBR BH. Modeling neutron beta decay occurring near the event horizon, we derive an analytical expression for the energy gained by electrons accelerated by the magnetic field. Applying our results to the supermassive BH at the Galactic center, $\mathrm{SgrA}^*$, we find that electrons can be accelerated up to energies of $\sim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{eV}$ for realistic values of the spin and magnetic field. Although these energies exceed the observed upper range of cosmic-ray electrons, radiative losses such as synchrotron emission and inverse-Compton scattering can efficiently reduce them to the observed $\mathrm{TeV}$ scale.

#### Hubble Tension and Dark Energy in Teleparallel Gauss-Bonnet Gravity: New Constraints from DESI BAO, Pantheon$^+$ and Hubble Data

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the cosmological dynamics of a teleparallel Gauss-Bonnet gravity model defined by the torsion scalar $T$ and the torsion-based Gauss-Bonnet invariant $T_{\mathcal{G}}$, deriving modified Friedmann equations for a flat FLRW Universe and corresponding linear scalar perturbation equations. Using a numerical approach, we solve these equations for pressureless matter, predicting the redshift evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis, incorporating late-time observations from Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon$^+$ with SH0ES, and DESI BAO (Data Release 1 and Data Release 2), constrains the model parameters, revealing that $f(T, T_{\mathcal{G}})$ mimics dark energy in the absence of a cosmological constant, presenting a viable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Stability is confirmed via scalar perturbation analysis of Hubble and matter density fluctuations, positioning $f(T, T_{\mathcal{G}})$ gravity as a robust framework to address cosmic acceleration challenges. The model yields a present-day effective equation of state $\omega_{\mathrm{eff}}(z=0) \approx -0.664$ to \(-0.693\), consistent with observations, and partially alleviates the Hubble tension with $H_0$ estimates of 69 to 71.5\kms. These findings highlight the potential of $f(T, T_{\mathcal{G}})$ gravity to resolve fundamental cosmological puzzles while aligning with late-time observational data.

#### Gravitational lensing beyond the eikonal approximation

 - **Abstract**
 Waves propagating through a gravitational potential exhibit wave-optics effects when their wavelength is not significantly smaller than the lensing scales. We study the propagation of a scalar wave, governed by the Klein-Gordon equation in curved spacetime, to focus on effects on amplitude and phase, while leaving aside the issue of wave polarization which affects electromagnetic and gravitational waves. Using the Newman-Penrose formalism, we obtain the first corrections beyond the geometric optics in the expansion in the inverse frequency. In vacuum, that is for Weyl tensor lensing, there is no wave effect at first order in $G$ and wave effects start at order $G^2$. Conversely, if the wave travels through a non-vanishing matter density, the first corrections start at order $G$. We check these analytic results by solving numerically the equations dictating the evolution of the corrections either in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole or through a transparent star.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate the geodesic motion of massless particles -- specifically photons -- in the spacetime of a charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) surrounded by a cloud of strings (CoS) within the framework of Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity. We analyze the effective potential that governs photon trajectories, explore the properties and location of the photon sphere (PS), and examine the effective radial force acting on photons. The resulting BH shadow is also studied, highlighting the roles of both the CoS parameter $\alpha$ and the KR field parameter $\ell$ in shaping its geometry. We constrain these parameters using observational data from M87* and Sgr A* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the motion of neutral test particles in the same gravitational background. By examining the impact of the CoS and KR field, we show how these additional fields modify the dynamics relative to standard charged BH scenarios. Finally, we study the fundamental frequencies associated with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of test particles, demonstrating how these frequencies are affected by the presence of the CoS and KR field. Our results reveal the rich structure of AdS-BH spacetimes influenced by string clouds and antisymmetric tensor fields, with potential observational consequences in gravitational wave and BH imaging astronomy.

#### Analyzing intermittent stochastic gravitational wave background I:Effect of detector response

 - **Abstract**
 With the growing number of gravitational-wave detections, particularly from binary black hole mergers, there is increasing anticipation that an astrophysical background, formed by an ensemble of faint, high-redshift events, will be observed in the near future by the ground-based detector network. This background is anticipated to exhibit non-Gaussian statistical properties. To develop a robust method for detecting such a non-Gaussian gravitational-wave background, we revisit optimal detection strategies based on the Gaussian-mixture likelihood model. In this work, we demonstrate that properly accounting for the detector antenna pattern is essential. Current approaches typically rely on the overlap reduction function averaged over the sky. Through simulations, we show that using such an averaged response introduces significant biases in parameter estimation. In addition, we propose a computationally feasible method that incorporates second-order corrections as an approximation of the full integral over the source distribution. Our results indicate that this approach effectively eliminates these biases. We also show that our method remains robust even when considering anisotropic backgrounds.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we apply the Simpson-Visser (SV) regularization scheme to Anti-de Sitter (AdS) charged black holes and investigate the resulting spacetime geometry in detail, with emphasis on both geodesic structure and thermodynamic behavior. In particular, we analyze the motion of massless particle, focusing on key features such as the photon sphere, black hole shadow, photon trajectory and the dynamics of charged particles, including the characteristics of the circular and type of orbits. Furthermore, we compare the theoretical predictions of the charged SV-AdS black hole with recent observations reported by the Event Horizon telescope (EHT) for M87* and Sgr~A*. Beyond the geodesic analysis, we explore the thermodynamics of the regularized charged SV-AdS black hole by deriving essential quantities such as the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. Through a systematic examination of these thermodynamic variables, we demonstrate how the regularization parameter inherent in the SV regularization influences particle dynamics, stability conditions, and the overall thermal properties of the modified black hole solution. This comprehensive study highlights the interplay between regularization effects and the physical observables associated with charged AdS black holes.

#### Rapid post-merger signal of circularly polarized gravitational wave from magnetic black hole superradiance: novel approach to detect magnetic monopole

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analytic framework demonstrating that a spinning black hole endowed with a net magnetic charge exhibits a dramatically amplified superradiant instability against charged scalar fields, enhanced by several orders of magnitude compared with the neutral Kerr case. The amplification arises from a monopole induced reduction of the centrifugal barrier. This shift deepens the gravitational bound-state potential well and produces a parametrically larger instability growth rate. This resulting rapid growth yields a macroscopic boson cloud that acts as a coherent source of near monochromatic continuous gravitational waves (GWs). We find an enhanced GW power. Monopole harmonic selection rules restrict the emission from the north (south) clouds corresponding to opposite helicities. Their superposition generates an (approximately) circularly polarized continuous GWs at a fixed sky location within even parity general relativity, distinct from the generic elliptical polarization of the Kerr case. In light of these new findings, we propose a potential smoking-gun search strategy for magnetic monopole and ultralight boson: the rapid post-merger follow-up GW signals from binary-black-hole merger remnants through ground-based and space-based GW experiments. In contrast to the Kerr case, where the signal turn-on can be delayed to decades-centuries, a magnetic remnant can form a cloud and emit a stronger, circularly polarized continuous GWs within weeks to months. Taking the magnetic supermassive remnants as an example, we demonstrate that the rapid follow-up GW signal in the mHz band appears just in few weeks after binary black hole mergers. Moreover, future polarization (ellipticity) measurements can distinguish the magnetic scenario from Kerr while providing a parity-even mechanism for circularly polarized GWs in general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 I solve the equations of the low-energy limit of string theory to obtain a solution corresponding to a microcanonical ensemble of highly-excited superstrings. This ``Superball of Strings'' is a static, spherically symmetric ``fuzzball'' of BPS strings with a size set by a random walk scaling. The solution can be embedded in string theory in a significant part of parameter space. While the solution does not constitute a Lorentzian interpretation for a Euclidean, horizonless solution by Chen, Maldacena, and Witten, a few connections are noted. A singular extremal black hole and the Superball of Strings exist as Supergravity solutions with the same asymptotic boundary conditions; however, I argue that the latter describes generic BPS microstates.
