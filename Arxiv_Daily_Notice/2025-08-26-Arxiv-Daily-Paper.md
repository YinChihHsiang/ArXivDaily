#### Estimating the Local Hubble Parameter from the Thermal Evolution of Earth and Mars

 - **Abstract**
 The problem of local (e.g., interplanetary) Hubble expansion is studied for a long time but remains a controversial subject till now; and of particular interest is a plausible value of the local Hubble parameter at the scale of the Solar system. Here, we tried to estimate the corresponding quantity by the analysis of surface temperatures on the Earth and Mars, which are formed by a competition between a variable luminosity of the Sun and increasing radii of the planetary orbits. Our work employs paleochemical and paleobiological data on the temperature of the ancient Earth, on the one hand, and geological data on the existence of an ocean of liquid water on the ancient Mars, on the other hand. As follows from our analysis, the martian data impose only a weak constraint on the admissible values of the Hubble parameter because of the unknown salinity - and, therefore, the freezing point - of the martian water. On the other hand, the terrestrial data turn out to be much more valuable, especially, for the Precambrian period, when temperature variation was sufficiently smooth and monotonic. For example, in the framework of standard LambdaCDM model with 70% of dark energy, contemporary value of the local Hubble parameter was found to be 70-90 km/s/Mpc under assumption that the Earth's surface temperature in the end of Precambrian equaled 45 C. This is in reasonable agreement both with the intergalactic data and with an independent estimate of the local Hubble parameter from tidal evolution of the Earth-Moon system.

 - **Abstract**
 I present written notes from three lectures given at the 54th Saas-Fee Advanced Course of the Swiss Society of Astrophysics and Astronomy in January 2025 entitled "Galaxies and Black Holes in the First Billion Years as seen by the JWST". I focused my lectures on progress in studies of cosmic reionisation, the properties of galaxies in the reionisation era, topics related to the redshift frontier and the search for Population III stars. The lectures were given to graduate students in astrophysics and cover both pedagogical material as well as observational results from the first two and half years of JWST science operations. The pace of discovery with JWST is, of course, rapid and so my lectures discuss long-term goals, analysis methods and their assumptions and limitations in the hope that the underlying material will retain value in the near future. In this written version, the visual material is that presented at Saas-Fee in January 2025 but I have provided updates on progress from the literature up to August 2025. The material is aimed at early career researchers and should not be considered as a scholarly review of the entire JWST literature on high redshift galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The $\Lambda$CDM model faces significant challenges, including an incomplete understanding of the dark sector and persistent tensions in the Hubble constant and the clustering amplitude. To address these issues, we propose a general disformal coupling between dark energy (DE) and dark matter from a field-theoretic action which can generate a rich variety of interactions including conformal and pure-momentum coupling scenarios. Our analysis reveals that a pure disformal coupling naturally produces a unique interacting Early Dark Sector, wherein the interactions with dark matter suppress the Hubble friction on the DE scalar field leading to a kinetic-driven cosmological constant-like behavior at early times followed by its dilution as $a^{-6}$ and eventually leading to a potential-driven epoch characteristic of late-time dark energy. In contrast to existing Early Dark Energy (EDE) models that rely on finely-tuned potentials, the EDE-like behavior, in our framework, is purely a consequence of the disformal coupling paired with the dilution of dark matter, offering a more fundamental and less ad hoc solution to cosmological tensions. This framework also predicts a suppression of power in the CMB temperature spectrum on large angular scales, offering a potential physical explanation for the observed low-$\ell$ anomaly. By deriving these effects from a fundamental action, our work provides a unified, testable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM that can be constrained by next-generation cosmological surveys and gravitational wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the impact of non-power-law spectra of matter perturbations with a bump or with a blue tilt at small scales on the evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) located the innermost part of galaxies. We study SMBH's mass growth rate and the epochs of their birth in four cosmological models using N-body simulations of dark matter within the box of $(100$~Mpc$/h)^3$. The simulations were populated with SMBHs using TRINITY semi-analytic model. We found that the most massive SMBHs at the redshifts $z=5-6$ are similar in all considered cosmologies, including the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. At larger $z$ the bumpy spectra can provide a tenfold increase (relative to $\Lambda$CDM model) in the masses of individual black holes without requiring super-Eddington accretion or heavy seeds. The nucleation of SMBHs starts at $z\sim 13$, which is earlier than in the standard $\Lambda$CMD model.

#### Gravitational Instability and Fragmentation in Collapsar Disks Supports the Formation of Sub-Solar Neutron Stars

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17183

 - **Abstract**
 We perform three-dimensional shearing-box hydrodynamical simulations to explore the outcome of gravitational instability in the outer regions of neutrino-cooled disks such as those formed from the collapse of rotating massive stars ("collapsars''). We employ a physical equation of state, optically-thin neutrino cooling, and assume an electron fraction set by the balance of electron/positron pair-capture reactions. Disks in a marginally stable initial state (Toomre parameter Q~ 1) undergo runaway cooling and fragmentation when the dimensionless cooling timescale obeys tau_cool = t_cool*Omega < 10, where Omega is the orbital frequency; these conditions correspond to accretion rates > Msun/s on the upper end of those achieved by collapsar progenitor stars. Fragmentation leads to the formation of neutron-rich clumps (electron fraction Ye ~ 0.1) spanning a range of masses ~0.01-1 Msun around the local Jeans value. Most clumps exceed the local Chandrasekhar mass M_Ch ~ Ye^2 and hence will continue to collapse to nuclear densities, forming neutron stars (NS) with sub-solar masses otherwise challenging to create through ordinary stellar core-collapse. Even cool disks dominated by alpha-particles (Ye ~ 0.5) can fragment and collapse into neutron-rich clumps capable of forming sub-solar NSs. Although our simulations cannot follow this process directly, if the disk-formed NSs subsequently pair into binaries, the gravitational wave chirps from their rapid mergers are potentially detectable by ground based observatories. The temporal coincidence of such a hierarchical NS merger chain with the collapsar gamma-ray burst and supernova would offer a uniquely spectacular multi-messenger "symphony''.

#### Crossing the phantom divide in scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17231

 - **Abstract**
 DESI observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) data, suggest that the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ crosses the phantom divide from $w_{\rm DE} < -1$ to $w_{\rm DE} > -1$ at low redshifts. In shift-symmetric Horndeski and generalized Proca theories with luminal gravitational-wave speed and no direct couplings to dark matter, we show that such a phantom-divide crossing is generically difficult without introducing theoretical pathologies. In Horndeski theories, however, breaking the shift symmetry allows this transition. We present an explicit model with broken shift symmetry, in which the scalar field has a potential in addition to a Galileon self-interaction and a higher-order derivative term. This model realizes the desired phantom-divide crossing at low redshifts while avoiding ghosts and Laplacian instabilities.

#### A Jetted Wandering Massive Black Hole Candidate in a Dwarf Galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Wandering massive black holes (MBHs) are thought to form through gravitational recoil or galaxy mergers, but observational confirmation of their displacement in dwarf galaxies, critical laboratories for early-universe SMBH seeding, remains scarce. Using multi-epoch very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), we identify a displaced MBH in the dwarf galaxy MaNGA 12772-12704, located 0.94 kilo-parsec from its optical center. The source exhibits unambiguous signatures of an accreting MBH: a brightness temperature exceeding $10^9$K, a parsec-scale jet, and flux density variability over a 30-year baseline. This system provides the first robust evidence that dynamical black hole interactions predicted in hierarchical galaxy evolution occur even in low-mass hosts. The discovery challenges models requiring centralized gas reservoirs for MBH growth and directly informs high-redshift seeding scenarios.

#### IGR J17091-3624: Newly Formed Periodic Dips Detected in the 2025 Outburst

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) candidate IGR J17091-3624 experienced a hard-state-only outburst in 2025. In this paper, we show that IXPE detected a series of intermittent X-ray dips, spanning a total interval of ~1 day. Subsequent observations with NICER, EP, NuSTAR, and Swift reveal that these dips recur with a period of 2.83$\pm$0.07 days and are accompanied by an increase in spectral hardness. This is the first time such quasi-periodic dipping behavior has been observed in this target since discovery. Our spectral analysis shows that the dips can be explained by obscuration from an ionized absorber characterized by an ionization parameter of $log{\xi}$ ~1-3 erg cm s$^{-1}$ and an equivalent hydrogen column density of $N^{\rm zxipcf}_{\rm H}$~(1-30)$\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. The periodic reappearance of the absorber is likely caused by obscuring material located in the outer accretion disk, modulated by the binary orbital period. If confirmed, this period would suggest that the donor star in IGR J17091-3624 has deviated from the standard main-sequence evolutionary path and is likely a (partially) stripped giant. In the optical band, no significant periodicity or correlation with the X-ray dips was detected, whereas the radio counterpart exhibited a flat to steep spectrum, in contrast to the inverted spectrum typically observed during the hard state of LMXBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Time series data and their time-frequency representation from gravitational-wave interferometers present multiple opportunities for the use of artificial intelligence methods associated with signal and image processing. Closely connected with this is the real-time aspect associated with gravitational-wave interferometers and the astrophysical observations they perform; the discovery potential of these instruments can be significantly enhanced when data processing can be achieved in O(1s) timescales. In this work, we introduce a novel signal and noise identification tool based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework. For its application into gravitational waves, we will refer to it as GW-YOLO. This tool can provide scene identification capabilities and essential information regarding whether an observed transient is any combination of noise and signal. Additionally, it supplies detailed time-frequency coordinates of the detected objects in the form of pixel masks, an essential property that can be used to understand and characterize astrophysical sources, as well as instrumental noise. The simultaneous identification of noise and signal, combined with precise pixel-level localization, represents a significant advancement in gravitational-wave data analysis. Our approach yields a 50\% detection efficiency for binary black hole signals at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 15 when such signals overlap with transient noise artifacts. When noise artifacts overlap with binary neutron star signals, our algorithm attains 50\% detection efficiency at an SNR of 30. This presents the first quantitative assessment of the ability to detect astrophysical events overlapping with realistic, instrument noise present in gravitational-wave interferometers.

 - **Abstract**
 The stochastic-$\delta \mathcal{N}$ formalism is widely used to study inflation models in which the quantum diffusion of inflatons dominates the background dynamics, leading to interesting phenomena such as the production of primordial black holes. Among numerical approaches to calculate the curvature perturbation spectrum $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ in this formalism, the Monte Carlo simulation-based approach has been proposed as a promising choice, especially in multifield cases. In this approach, we generate many paths of inflatons from the initial points to the end of inflation, obtain statistics of $\delta N$ from the paths, and then estimate $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$. However, this method involves a nested Monte Carlo simulation, which requires generating many branch paths from each trunk path at the point corresponding to the scale $k$ of interest, resulting in a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new Monte Carlo-based approach that utilizes least squares fitting, introducing two novel features for reducing computational cost. First, we devise a simple estimator of a key statistic $\langle \delta\mathcal{N}_{\mathbf{X}}^2\rangle$, the variance of $\delta \mathcal{N}$ conditioned on the branching point, to avoid nesting path generation. Second, via least squares fitting of a parametric function to the sampled values of the estimator, we obtain not just an estimate of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ for a single value of $k$ but an approximating function of $\mathcal{P}_\zeta(k)$ over a range of $k$ of interest. We also conduct numerical demonstrations for concrete inflation models, which show the usefulness of our method.

#### Constraining deviations from $Λ$CDM in the Hubble expansion rate

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged)We explore a phenomenological model that quantifies the deviation of the Hubble expansion rate from the standard scenario. The specific form of this model is expressed as $H^{2}(z) = H^{2}_{\rm \Lambda CDM}(\Omega_m, z)[1+\delta(z)]$. We consider three forms of $\delta(z)$: model I, $\delta(z)=\delta_c$; model II, $\delta(z)=\delta_{c}z/(1+z)$, and model III, $\delta(z)=\delta_{c}{\rm ln}(1+z)$. Here, $\delta_c$ represents a constant value. To constrain the models, we utilize a comprehensive set of observational data, including DESI BAO, CMB, CC, SNIa data, and the $H_0$ measured by the SH0ES. Our results show that for most combined datasets, $\delta_c$ tends to take on negative values for models I and II, while consistently taking positive values in model III. Our analysis further discloses that for model I, in which the deviation parameter is redshift-independent, there is a notable 2$\sigma$ deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model when considering the combined datasets of DESI BAO+CMB+CC+SH0ES. However, this deviation decreases to less than $2\sigma$ once SNIa datasets are included. In contrast, model II remains consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model across all datasets examined. Model III exhibits a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model, exceeding $2\sigma$ and reaching $3\sigma$ for the full combined datastes. The Akaike Information Criterion indicates that models I and II are consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model, whereas model III is preferred over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, with the $\Lambda$CDM model being substantially disfavored for the combined datasets DESI BAO+CMB+CC+SH0ES+DESY5. These results suggest that the Hubble expansion rate likely deviates from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction-a conclusion that aligns with various studies on dark energy, wherein dynamic dark energy is often favored over a cosmological constant.

#### Dark Degeneracy in DESI DR2: Interacting or Evolving Dark Energy?

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17955

 - **Abstract**
 The standard $\Lambda$CDM model, despite its success, is challenged by persistent observational tensions in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the matter clustering amplitude ($S_8$), motivating the exploration of alternative cosmological scenarios. We investigate a dark energy model with a phenomenological interaction in the dark sector, constructed to be exactly degenerate at the background level with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. This setup allows us to test whether models with identical expansion histories but distinct physical mechanisms can be distinguished by cosmological data. We perform a Bayesian analysis using a combination of recent datasets: DESI DR2 BAO measurements, DESY5 supernovae, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that both the interacting model and the CPL model provide significantly better fits to the data than $\Lambda$CDM. Although indistinguishable in background observables, the interacting model predicts a distinct matter-sector evolution driven by a late-time sign change in the dark sector interaction at $z \approx 0.8$, corresponding to the $w=-1$ crossing in the CPL description. In this sense, the interacting picture may be considered more physical, since it avoids the problematic crossing by construction. The resulting decay of dark energy into dark matter lowers $S_8$, potentially alleviating the weak-lensing $S_8$ tension. At the same time, it predicts a sharp suppression of the growth rate $f\sigma_8(z)$ at $z \lesssim 0.8$, which is in tension with current measurements of structure formation. This indicates that the model may not simultaneously reconcile the expansion history and the observed growth of cosmic structure, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive analysis to fully assess its viability.

#### Investigating Optical and Ring-Down Gravitational Wave Properties of a Rotating Black Hole in a Dehnen Galactic Dark Matter Halo

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of the optical and dynamical properties of a rotating black hole immersed in a Dehnen-type $(1,4,0)$ galactic dark matter halo, modeled by a double power-law density profile commonly used to describe realistic galactic cores. By extending our previous Schwarzschild-Dehnen solution using a modified Newman-Janis algorithm, we construct a Kerr-like axisymmetric spacetime that smoothly incorporates both black hole rotation and the influence of the surrounding dark matter halo. We systematically investigate the effects of the halo parameters-the central density and halo radius-on horizon structure, the shape and extent of the ergoregion, and the null geodesics associated with black hole shadows. Our results show that the presence of a dense or extended halo expands the event horizon and ergoregion, and significantly alters the size and distortion of the black hole shadow. Furthermore, by applying the WKB approximation to scalar field perturbations, we compute the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra and demonstrate that the frequencies and damping times of ringdown signals are highly sensitive to the halo profile. These results open promising avenues for probing the dark matter environment of astrophysical black holes through black hole imaging and gravitational wave observations.

#### GWTC-4.0: Population Properties of Merging Compact Binaries

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18083

 - **Abstract**
 We detail the population properties of merging compact objects using 158 mergers from the cumulative Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4.0, which includes three types of binary mergers: binary neutron star, neutron star--black hole binary, and binary black hole mergers. We resolve multiple over- and under-densities in the black hole mass distribution: features persist at primary masses of $10\,M_\odot$ and $35\,M_\odot$ with a possible third feature at $\sim 20\,M_\odot$. These are departures from an otherwise power-law-like continuum that steepens above $35\,M_\odot$. Binary black holes with primary masses near $10\,M_\odot$ are more likely to have less massive secondaries, with a mass ratio distribution peaking at $q = 0.74^{+0.13}_{-0.13}$, potentially a signature of stable mass transfer during binary evolution. Black hole spins are inferred to be non-extremal, with 90\% of black holes having $\chi < 0.57$, and preferentially aligned with binary orbits, implying many merging binaries form in isolation. However, we find a significant fraction, 0.24--0.42, of binaries have negative effective inspiral spins, suggesting many could be formed dynamically in gas-free environments. We find evidence for correlation between effective inspiral spin and mass ratio, though it is unclear if this is driven by variation in the mode of the distribution or the width. (Abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 We test the impact of an evolving supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass scaling relation (Mbh-Mbulge) on the predictions for the gravitational wave background (GWB). The observed GWB amplitude is 2-3 times higher than predicted by astrophysically informed models which suggests the need to revise the assumptions in those models. We compare a semi-analytic model's ability to reproduce the observed GWB spectrum with a static versus evolving-amplitude Mbh-Mbulge relation. We additionally consider the influence of the choice of galaxy stellar mass function on the modeled GWB spectra. Our models are able to reproduce the GWB amplitude with either a large number density of massive galaxies or a positively evolving Mbh-Mbulge amplitude (i.e., the Mbh / Mbulge ratio was higher in the past). If we assume that the Mbh-Mbulge amplitude does not evolve, our models require a galaxy stellar mass function that implies an undetected population of massive galaxies (Mstellar > 10^11 Msun at z > 1). When the Mbh-Mbulge amplitude is allowed to evolve, we can model the GWB spectrum with all fiducial values and an Mbh-Mbulge amplitude that evolves as alpha(z) = alpha_0 (1 + z)^(1.04 +/- 0.5).

 - **Abstract**
 The dipole in the angular distribution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is typically attributed to the Doppler effect and our motion relative to the CMB rest frame. It is expected that observations of large-scale structures would also exhibit a related kinematic dipole, helping to confirm the kinematic origin of the CMB dipole. However, numerous studies of the large-scale structure dipole have shown significant discrepancies with predictions based on the CMB. In this work, we investigate how considering the clustering dipole affects the cosmic large-scale structure distribution dipole using the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS) and examine the nonlinear regime to calculate the correlation between the clustering dipole and the kinematic dipole. We also determine whether these outcomes help reconcile previous measurements of the NVSS dipole with predictions based on the CMB. Additionally, we explore a model in which the distribution of matter on large scales might be intrinsically anisotropic. Using the remnant discrepancy between the observed and predicted dipole, we derive an upper limit for the amplitude of intrinsic anisotropy and calculate the clustering for this model. Furthermore, we investigate these results within the framework of modified gravity theories, specifically the $f(R)$ gravity model. By examining this model, it is possible to gain a better understanding of how the cosmic dark energy component affects the dipole. Finally, by comparing these two models, we can see that the $f(R)$ model predicts a higher clustering dipole compared to the standard cosmological model, which explains the discrepancy between the kinetic and clustering dipoles and leads to a higher dipole amplitude.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the gravitational baryogenesis scenario within the context of $F(R)$ gravity's rainbow which incorporates both modified gravity and energy-dependent spacetime. This study explores a mechanism for generating baryon asymmetry based on the interaction between the derivative of the Ricci scalar $R$ and the baryon current within the framework of $F(R)$ gravity's rainbow. The rainbow functions, arising from quantum gravity effects, modify the gravitational interaction and the Friedmann equations, leading to a distinct evolution of the baryon asymmetry compared to standard $F(R)$ gravity. We analyze the conditions under which a viable baryon asymmetry can be produced, taking into account the constraints from cosmological observations and the specific form of the $F(R)$ function. By examining the cosmological equations in the context of $F(R)$ gravity's rainbow, we obtain power-law solutions for these equations. We also identify the decoupling temperature and the ratio of baryonic number to entropy density in this model, depending on the model's parameters. First, we discuss the acceptable intervals of the model's parameters which are defined by constraints on the background quantity. We note that the decoupling temperature and the ratio of baryon-to-entropy in these models depend on the value of the rainbow function. We compare the predictions of this model with the existing observational data. Our results suggest that $F(R)$ gravity's rainbow provides a novel mechanism for gravitational baryogenesis, potentially explaining the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe while incorporating quantum gravity corrections.

 - **Abstract**
 We review the cosmic generalisation of the virial theorem known as the Layzer-Irvine equation, also independently derived by Dmitriev and Zeldovich. This equation has been studied in the literature for dark matter-dark energy interaction models, as well as in the context of alternative theories of gravity. We discuss results from the previous scenarios and point out future directions.

 - **Abstract**
 We study whether gravitational waves (GWs) from binary black hole (BBH) mergers show a difference between right- and left-handed circular polarizations. Such a difference could point to a violation of parity symmetry in gravity. We analyze publicly available data from the collaboration of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detectors, focusing on events with accurate sky localization using all three detectors. This allows us to separate the circular polarization modes and measure their amplitudes. Out of 15 well-localized events, 7 show a dominant right-handed mode and 8 a left-handed one. This small difference is consistent with statistical fluctuations. A Bayesian analysis shows that the probability $ p_R $ of a right-handed signal follows a $Beta(8,9)$ distribution, with no strong evidence for asymmetry. We also estimate how many future events would be needed to detect a small asymmetry like $p_R = 7 / 15$ with high confidence. To reach 2$\sigma$ or 3$\sigma$ significance, about 900 to 2000 well-localized events would be required. These numbers could be reached in upcoming observation runs. Our results support parity symmetry for now, but future data may allow us to test it more precisely.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole (BH) perturbation theory and the scattering models provide a powerful framework for studying gravitational lensing at the wave-optics level. However, conventional calculations encountered two issues: the divergence of the partial-wave series and the divergence of the Poisson spot near the optical axis. These issues hinder the accurate calculation of lensed waveforms and the study of polarization and wave characteristics in the lensing process, especially near the optical axis. This work demonstrates that both divergences stem from the asymptotic expansion of the radial wave function. By computing the scattered wave function at finite radii and avoiding the asymptotic expansion, we naturally obtain convergent results. We compute scalar waves scattered by (1) a weak-gravity body with Newtonian potential and (2) a Schwarzschild BH with Regge-Wheeler potential. In both cases, we analyze the convergence of the partial-wave series and present finite-luminosity diffraction patterns, with a bright Poisson spot. The above calculations are compared with the Kirchhoff diffraction integral in the near-axis regions and give consistent results. Our investigations provide a foundation for studying gravitational wave scattering by BHs and understanding lensing at the wave-optics level.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel method to constrain the electric charge of the supermassive black hole M87* by analyzing the orbital angular momentum content of the light it emits. By leveraging the established analogy between rotating spacetimes and inhomogeneous optical media, we derive a simple analytical formula that relates the average orbital angular momentum in the observed radiation to the black hole's charge-to-mass ratio. Applying this relation to existing observational data, we place an upper bound of $\mathcal{Q}/M \lesssim 0.39$ on the charge of M87*. While the analysis focuses on electric charge, which is used here purely as a theoretical example since astrophysical black holes are expected to be approximately neutral, the method is general and can be extended to constrain other types of charges $\unicode{x2013}$ degrees of freedom that define distinct black hole solutions. These results demonstrate the potential of orbital angular momentum as a new fundamental degree of freedom to be exploited in astrophysics, providing a complementary and independent alternative to shadow-based techniques for probing the properties of rotating compact objects and testing gravity in the strong-field regime.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the Kretschmann scalar within the framework of Parameterized Absolute Parallelism (PAP) geometry, extending the classical understanding of spacetime curvature in General Relativity by incorporating torsion. This extension introduces a dimensionless parameter b, allowing a continuous interpolation between Riemannian geometry (b = 0) and Weitzenbock geometry (b = 1). Using the pseudo-Riemannian metric associated with Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology, we derive an explicit expression for the modified Kretschmann scalar, which captures contributions from standard curvature, curvature-torsion interactions, and pure torsion. Our analysis reveals that the modified scalar reduces to the classical value under specific conditions (b = 0 or b = +/- sqrt(2)), while deviations occur for other b values. This work highlights the potential role of torsion in early-universe dynamics and provides a framework for exploring deviations from standard General Relativity in cosmological models, such as the Big Bang-Big Rip model (BRM).

 - **Abstract**
 Many astrophysical processes can produce gravitational wave (GW) sources with significant orbital eccentricity. These binaries emit bursts of gravitational radiation during each pericenter passage. In isolated systems, the intrinsic timing of these bursts is solely determined by the properties of the binary. The presence of a nearby third body perturbs the system and alters the burst timing. Accurately modeling such perturbations therefore offers a novel approach to detecting the presence of a nearby companion. Existing timing models account for Newtonian dynamics and leading-order radiation reaction effects but neglect the higher order post-Newtonian (PN) contributions to the inner binary. In this paper, we present an improved timing model that incorporates conservative PN corrections that lead to the precession of the binary's pericenter. We find that these PN corrections significantly impact the binary's orbital evolution and the timing of the GW burst. In particular, 1PN precession gives rise to distinctive modulation features in the binary's semilatus rectum and eccentricity. These modulations encode valuable information about the presence and properties of the third body, including its mass and distance. Furthermore, unmodeled 1PN effects significantly bias the tertiary's mass and distance. Finally we assess the detectability of GW bursts from such perturbed systems and demonstrate that the inclusion of PN corrections is crucial for accurately capturing the orbital dynamics of hierarchical triples.

 - **Abstract**
 For the centennial of quantum mechanics, we offer an overview of the central role played by quantum information and thermalization in problems involving fundamental properties of spacetime and gravitational physics. This is an open area of research still a century after the initial development of formal quantum mechanics, highlighting the effectiveness of quantum physics in the description of all natural phenomena. These remarkable connections can be highlighted with the tools of modern quantum optics, which effectively addresses the three-fold interplay of interacting atoms, fields, and spacetime backgrounds describing gravitational fields and noninertial systems. In this review article, we select aspects of these phenomena centered on quantum features of the acceleration radiation of particles in the presence of black holes. The ensuing horizon-brightened radiation (HBAR) provides a case study of the role played by quantum physics in nontrivial spacetime behavior, and also shows a fundamental correspondence with black hole thermodynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic voids are increasingly recognized as a promising tool for cosmological exploration. Their distribution and density profiles are highly responsive to alterations in gravitational theories, along with the influences of dark energy and neutrinos. Investigating voids offers a compelling opportunity to uncover signatures of alternative gravity models on a cosmological level. Voids span a notable range of density contrasts, from approximately -$1$ near their centers to around $0$ at their edges, where screening mechanisms become less effective. The primary objective of this study is to explore a novel model that introduces a new category of wormhole solutions by leveraging cosmic voids$-$vast underdense regions of the universe$-$for the first time. We focus on identifying new exact static wormhole models by proposing an alternative viewpoint on their matter content, rooted in the recently formulated $f(R,\mathcal{L}_m,T)$ theory of gravity. By developing a unique solution based on a universal density profile for voids, we examine crucial constraints on the parameters that dictate matter distribution and the structure of spacetime itself. Our results reveal how these cosmic voids significantly influence the geometry of wormholes, steepening the gradient toward the throat and mitigating violations of the null and weak energy conditions, particularly beyond their centers. We also highlight intriguing gravitational lensing effects, showing that this wormhole repels light rather than capturing it, creating a fascinating interaction between gravity and light.

#### Testing the weak cosmic censorship conjecture via test particle induced overcharging/overspinning of Kerr Newman modified gravity black hole

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC) violation through the absorption of a charged, rotating test particle by Kerr Newman spacetime in modified gravity (KN MOG). The result is sensitive to multiple factors, including the sign of the particle's charge relative to that of the black hole, as well as the direction of rotation of the particle and the black hole. Additionally, the combined effect of the MOG parameter, the black hole's charge and angular momentum plays a significant role. Taking all these into account, we have determined the range of the particle's charge, angular momentum and energy of the particle for which the event horizon disappears. Our analysis shows that the WCCC can be violated in both extremal and non extremal KN MOG black hole, provided the particle's parameters are small and precisely adjusted. Crucially, prior work by [1] discussed the WCCC in KN spacetime without considering the modified gravity parameter {\alpha}. In contrast, our study shows that incorporating {\alpha} significantly enlarges the range of permissible parameters for the test particle, leading to the violation of the WCCC in both extremal and non extremal KN MOG black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent works, a framework has been developed to describe (quantum) deformed, spherically symmetric and static black holes in four dimensions. The key idea of this so-called Effective Metric Description (EMD) is to parametrise deformations of the classical Schwarzschild geometry by two functions that depend on a physical quantity and which are calculated in a self-consistent way as series expansions in the vicinity of the horizon. In this work we further strengthen this framework by first demonstrating that the corresponding series expansion coefficients can be completely and uniquely determined from measurements that are accessible for observers outside of the event horizon: we propose a Gedankenexperiment, consisting of probes following a free-falling trajectory that send signals to a stationary observer and show how an EMD can be constructed from suitable telemetric data. Furthermore, by linking the expansion coefficients of the EMD to the invariant eigenvalues of the energy momentum tensor, we determine a system of physical fields that provides an effective Einstein equation for the deformed black hole geometry. In the case of a simplified geometry and assuming that the metric deformations are small, we can write the leading order of the physical fields in a closed form in the metric functions. We illustrate our results at the example of the Hayward space-time.

#### Exact Solutions for a Teleparallel Cosmological Model with Vector Field via Noether Symmetry

 - **Abstract**
 We study a cosmological model in the framework of teleparallel gravity, where a vector field $A_\mu$ is non-minimally coupled to the torsion scalar $T$ in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe. Using the Noether symmetry approach, we identify specific forms for the coupling function $g(\xi)$ and the potential $V(\xi) = V_0 \xi^n$, with $\xi \equiv A_\mu A^\mu$. The method allows us to find exact analytical solutions for the scale factor $a(t)$ and the scalar function $\xi(t)$. General solutions for arbitrary values of $n$ are derived, but special cases such as $n = 1$ and $n = 3$ are studied separately due to their distinct behavior. For $n = 1$, the model describes a transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion, and depending on the value of the model parameter, a transition to a phantom phase is also possible, which is consistent with phantom dark energy. For the special case $n=3$, this model first experiences a deceleration phase and then enters a stable accelerating phase, such that the acceleration parameter $q(t)$ changes from positive to negative values and the equation of state parameter $\omega_\xi(t)$ tends to $-1$ at late times, similar to quintessence dark energy. Unlike the case $n=1$, in this case, no transition to the phantom phase is observed. Therefore, this model can describe the behavior of the universe during periods of dark energy dominance.

 - **Abstract**
 Quantum mechanics is the fundamental framework of nature, and gravitational waves from binary black holes should likewise be analyzed quantum mechanically. It is commonly assumed that their classical description corresponds to a coherent state, so any deviation would signal genuinely quantum nature of gravity. We show that the coherent-state description reproduces classical gravitational waves at leading order, while next-order effects generate squeezed states of gravitons. For GW150914, we estimate the squeezing parameter to be $\sim 10^{-3}$. Detection of such squeezing with LIGO, Virgo, or KAGRA would provide direct evidence for the quantization of gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive analytically the amplitude of the quadratic quasi-normal mode generated in the ringdown stage of the gravitational waveform produced by the ultra-relativistic head-on collision of two non-spinning Schwarzschild black holes. Although being a highly nonlinear event, second-order perturbation theory suffices and that nonlinearities may be derived by a simple bootstrapping procedure.

 - **Abstract**
 The horizonless configuration of regular black holes has recently attracted attention as a model for ultracompact stars. In this paper, we propose a new class of regular black hole models sourced by a de Sitter vacuum with a finite radius. We focus on studying its horizonless configuration, which is modified into an anisotropic gravastar by proposing an ansatz of equation of states. We confirm that an anisotropic gravastar approaching horizon formation must violate the dominant energy condition. We also found that the proposed object has an effectively similar structure as a frozen star on the time geometry at the extremal configuration. From the proposed model, we investigate the photon geodesics inside the object and predict the optical appearance of the object surrounded by a thin accretion disk. Our imaging results indicate that, assuming light does not interact with the object's interior, its optical appearance differs from that of a thin-shell gravastar. ``Chaotic" photon ring merges for $x>x_{m}$, where $x_{m}$ represents the minimum value required for the photon sphere to exist. In addition to its optical appearance, we investigate the axial gravitational perturbations emitted by this horizonless star. Notably, echo trains are found to exist for $x>x_{m}$, as determined by numerically solving the time-dependent Regge-Wheeler equation. By comparing the echo time with the GW170817 observation, we find that a frequency of 72 Hz can be achieved, albeit at the cost of requiring a relatively high value of $\ell$.

 The Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC) is a collection of short-duration (transient) gravitational wave signals identified by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration in gravitational-wave data produced by the eponymous detectors. The catalog provides information about the identified candidates, such as the arrival time and amplitude of the signal and properties of the signal's source as inferred from the observational data. GWTC is the data release of this dataset and version 4.0 extends the catalog to include observations made during the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run up until 2024 January 31. This paper marks an introduction to a collection of articles related to this version of the catalog, GWTC-4.0. The collection of articles accompanying the catalog provides documentation of the methods used to analyze the data, summaries of the catalog of events, observational measurements drawn from the population, and detailed discussions of selected candidates

 - **Abstract**
 Version 4.0 of the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4.0) adds new candidates detected by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA observatories through the first part of the fourth observing run (O4a: 2023 May 24 15:00:00 to 2024 January 16 16:00:00 UTC) and a preceding engineering run. In this new data, we find 128 new compact binary coalescence candidates that are identified by at least one of our search algorithms with a probability of astrophysical origin $p_{\rm astro} \geq 0.5$ and that are not vetoed during event validation. We also provide detailed source property measurements for 86 of these that have a false alarm rate $< 1 \rm{yr}^{-1}$. Based on the inferred component masses, these new candidates are consistent with signals from binary black holes and neutron star-black hole binaries (GW230518_125908 and GW230529_181500). Median inferred component masses of binary black holes in the catalog now range from $5.79\,M_\odot$ (GW230627_015337) to $137\,M_\odot$ (GW231123_135430), while GW231123_135430 was probably produced by the most massive binary observed in the catalog. For the first time we have discovered binary black hole signals with network signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 30, GW230814_230901 and GW231226_01520, enabling high-fidelity studies of the waveforms and astrophysical properties of these systems. Combined with the 90 candidates included in GWTC-3.0, the catalog now contains 218 candidates with $p_{\rm astro} \geq 0.5$ and not otherwise vetoed, doubling the size of the catalog and further opening our view of the gravitational-wave Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Broad all-sky searches for continuous gravitational waves have high computational costs and require hierarchical pipelines. The sensitivity of these approaches is set by the initial search and by the number of candidates from that stage that can be followed-up. The current follow-up schemes for the deepest surveys require careful tuning and set-up, have a significant human-labor cost and this impacts the number of follow-ups that can be afforded. Here we present and demonstrate a new follow-up framework based on Bayesian parameter estimation for the rapid, highly automated follow-up of candidates produced by the early stages of deep, wide-parameter space searches for continuous waves.

 - **Abstract**
 We numerically construct asymptotically global $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ black holes in type IIB supergravity, with $\mathbb{R}_t \times SO(2) \times SO(3) \times U(1)^4$ symmetry, localised on the $\mathrm{S}^3$ and translationally invariant along the torus. These solutions, with horizons whose spatial cross sections have $\mathrm{S}^4 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ topology, dominate the microcanonical ensemble at low energies. At higher energies, a first-order phase transition occurs to $\mathrm{BTZ} \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ black holes $-$ possessing $\mathbb{R}_t \times SO(2) \times SO(4) \times U(1)^4$ symmetry and $\mathrm{S}^1 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$ horizon topology. By the AdS/CFT correspondence, this transition reflects the spontaneous breaking of the $SO(4)$ R-symmetry of the D1-D5 CFT$_2$ to $SO(3)$. We also compute the expectation value of the scalar operator with lowest conformal dimension in the low-energy phase. Our $SO(3)$-localised black holes $-$ together with the $U(1)^2$-localised solutions of [1] $-$ point to a rich landscape of novel black holes that may approach the $\mathrm{CFT}_2$ sparseness bootstrap condition, and shed light on how macroscopic entanglement in thermal phases encodes microscopic structure via internal directions.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a set of higher-form conserved currents on spacetimes admitting conformal Killing-Yano tensors. We find relations between these currents that allow the charge given by integrating one of these currents over a region to be re-expressed as an integral of a covariant quantity over the boundary. In many cases, only a non-covariant form of the boundary integral was previously known. For a special class of these currents the conservation does not rely on field equations, so they give conserved topological charges in any gravitational theory. We discuss the relation of our currents to the Komar current and derive several new properties of conformal Killing-Yano tensors. We study a number of applications of our construction to charges of black hole solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory, and D-brane solutions of type II supergravity.

 - **Abstract**
 Nonlinear scalar-tensor theories of gravity have been considered as candidates for dark matter and dark energy. Often, they possess screening mechanisms which allow the fifth force mediated by the additional scalar degree(s) of freedom to evade detection from local experiments. Their classical behaviour is well studied, but their quantum nature is relatively unexplored. We outline a Green's function method for obtaining the leading-order quantum corrections to the classical symmetron field profile in the vicinity of a spherically symmetric extended source. For parameters that experiments had previously ruled out, our calculations indicate that the symmetron force may be weaker than the classical field suggests.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study the holographic quantum entanglement structure in the finite-temperature CFT state/planar BTZ black hole correspondence from the perspective of entanglement threads. Unlike previous studies based on bit threads, these entanglement threads provide a more detailed characterization of the contribution sources to the von Neumann entropy of boundary subregions, in particular by quantitatively deriving the flux function of entanglement threads that traverse the wormhole horizon and connect the two asymptotic boundaries. Since entanglement threads are naturally and closely related to tensor network states, the results are argued to imply the existence of the perfect-type entanglement formed jointly by the entanglement threads crossing the wormhole and the internal threads in the single-sided boundary. We also discuss the close connections of this work with concepts such as bit threads and partial entanglement entropy.

 - **Abstract**
 This thesis explores thermal correlation functions in conformal field theories (CFTs) and their connection to black hole geometry within the AdS/CFT correspondence, using a near-boundary expansion as the main tool. Two themes are examined. First, we show that the stress-tensor sector of boundary correlators encodes information about black hole singularities. By resumming contributions from the stress-tensor and its composites, we uncover branch-point singularities in complex time, corresponding to bulk geodesics that cross the horizon, reflect off the singularity, and return to the boundary. We further clarify the role of double-trace operators in restoring analyticity and the KMS condition, and establish a map between bulk geodesics and OPE sectors of the thermal correlator. Second, we study thermal stress-tensor correlators in CFTs with pure gravity duals. Through holographic calculations in Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we identify a robust universal behaviour - near the lightcone the correlators are described by three universal functions. The bulk Lagrangian only affects the arguments of these functions through corrections to the cubic stress-tensor couplings and the thermal stress-tensor one-point function. We relate this behaviour to causality constraints such as the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), showing that ANEC saturation makes the correlator temperature-independent. Overall, our results demonstrate that thermal correlators - especially their stress-tensor sector - serve as sensitive probes of black hole interiors, causality, and universality in holographic CFTs.

 - **Abstract**
 In the modified measure formulation string or branes the tension appear as an additional dynamical degree of freedom . Furthermore in the presence of an additional background scalar field that couples to the strings and locally changes the tension, the tension field really dynamical and the theory has an intrinsic target space scale symmetry. When many types of strings probing the same region of space are considered this tension scalar is constrained by the requirement of quantum conformal invariance. For the case of two types of strings probing the same region of space with different dynamically generated tensions, there are two different metrics, associated to the different strings. Each of these metrics have to satisfy vacuum Einsteins equations and the consistency of these two Einsteins equations determine the tension scalar. The universal metric, common to both strings generically does not satisfy Einsteins equation . We review a case where two string dependent metrics considered here are flat space in Minkowski space and Minkowski space after a special conformal transformation and leads to a well defined brane world solution. We review how the model avoid swampland constraints making treatments for Dark energy and inflation more realistic and how strings with a different tension appear as Dark Matter to us. Since the Dark strings and since the visible strings share the space time, including the same compactification, and since the compactification determines the particle content, we argue that the dark strings lead to Dark copies of the standard model. An argument that many copies will lead to 4D effective spacetime as a consequence of a target space scale symmetry restoration.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the thermodynamics of phantom BTZ black holes by incorporating leading-order perturbative corrections arising from small statistical fluctuations around equilibrium. Starting from the phantom BTZ black holes review, we describe a modified action in three-dimensional spacetime that includes coupling with a Maxwell or phantom field. The analysis derives the corresponding field equations and obtains exact solutions for the metric and thermodynamic quantities. The corrected entropy is computed using the steepest descent method. It is expressed in terms of the leading-order entropy and Hawking temperature. Standard thermodynamic relations yield the corrected mass, Helmholtz free energy, specific heat, and Gibbs free energy. These corrections reveal significant deviations from classical results, particularly in the small black hole regime where statistical effects become prominent. Graphical analysis shows that the corrected entropy becomes negative for sufficiently small black holes, indicating potential limitations in thermodynamic stability under perturbative corrections. Furthermore, the influence of thermal fluctuations proves substantial for the small black holes and negligible for larger black holes. In this work, we have also calculated critical points and critical compressibility factor ($Z_{c}$) of the phantom BTZ black hole, treating it as a Van der Waals fluid. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of how statistical fluctuations modify the thermodynamics of phantom BTZ black holes. It underscores the necessity of including such corrections in realistic models of black hole thermodynamics in $(2+1)$ dimensions.

 - **Abstract**
 We justify the applicability of the background subtraction method to both Einstein's gravity and its higher derivative corrections in 5-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetimes, where the corresponding higher derivative corrections to the expression for the ADM mass and angular momentum are also worked out. Then we further apply the background subtraction method to calculate the first order corrected Gibbs free energy induced by the higher derivative terms up to the quadratic of Riemann tensor for the 5-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole, which is in exact agreement with the previous result obtained by the holographic renormalization method. Such an agreement in turn substantiates the applicability of the background subtraction method.
