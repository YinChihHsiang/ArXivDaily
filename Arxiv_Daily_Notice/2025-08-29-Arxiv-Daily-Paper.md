 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, modifications to General Relativity (GR) have been explored to address cosmological observations, particularly in the context of late-time cosmic acceleration. Among these, modifications based on the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR), particularly $f(T)$ gravity, have gained significant attention. In this work, we investigate the scalar perturbations in $f(T)$ gravity, focusing on how these perturbations modify the Poisson and lensing equations and how they impact cosmological observables. By incorporating observational data from cosmic chromatometers, Big Bang nucleosynthesis, the DESI BAO survey, and Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), we derive constraints on the parameters of the $f(T)$ power-law model. Our results suggest that $f(T)$ gravity can effectively alleviate some of the tensions observed in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, including the Hubble constant ($H_0$) discrepancy. Furthermore, the evolution of the supernova luminosity and its dependence on the gravitational constant are considered to refine the measurement of cosmological parameters. The model's ability to address the $H_0$ tension is critically examined, and we find that $f(T)$ gravity offers a viable alternative to the standard model. The work concludes by comparing the fits of the $f(T)$ gravity model to the $\Lambda$CDM model using various information criteria, revealing key insights into the viability of modified gravity in contemporary cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs) are luminous, recurring X-ray outbursts from galactic nuclei, with timescales of hours to days. While their origin remains uncertain, leading models invoke accretion disk instabilities or the interaction of a massive black hole (MBH) with a lower-mass secondary in an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI). EMRI scenarios offer a robust framework for interpreting QPEs by characterizing observational signatures associated with the secondary's orbital dynamics. This, in turn, enables extraction of the MBH/EMRI physical properties and provides a means to test the EMRI scenario, distinguishing models and addressing the question: what can QPE timings teach us about massive black holes and EMRIs? In this study, we employ analytic expressions for Kerr geodesics to efficiently resolve the trajectory of the secondary object and perform GPU-accelerated Bayesian inference to assess the information content of QPE timings. Using our inference framework, referred to as QPE-FIT (Fast Inference with Timing), we explore QPE timing constraints on astrophysical parameters, such as EMRI orbital parameters and MBH mass/spin. We find that mild-eccentricity EMRIs ($e\sim0.1-0.3$) can constrain MBH mass and EMRI semimajor axis/eccentricity to the 10% level within tens of orbital periods, while MBH spin is unconstrained for the explored semimajor axes $\geq 100R_g$ and monitoring baselines $\mathcal{O}(10-100\rm)$ orbits. Introducing a misaligned precessing disk generally degrades inference of EMRI orbital parameters, but can constrain disk precession properties within 10-50%. This work both highlights the prospect of QPE observations as dynamical probes of galactic nuclei and outlines the challenge of doing so in the multimodal parameter space of EMRI-disk collisions.

#### Removing atmospheric turbulence from ground-based astrometry with fast correlation function measurements

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20208

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20208

 - **Abstract**
 We present a code that removes $\sim 90\%$ of the variance in astrometric measurements caused by atmospheric turbulence, by using Gaussian process regression (GPR) to interpolate the turbulence field from the positions of stars measured by Gaia to the positions of arbitrary targets. This enables robust and routine accuracy of 1-3 milliarcsec on bright sources in single exposures of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). For the kernel of the GPR, we use the anisotropic correlation function of the turbulent displacement field, as measured directly from the Gaia reference stars, which should yield optimal accuracy if the displacement field is Gaussian. We test the code on 26 simulated LSST exposures and 604 real DES exposures in varying conditions. The average correlation function of the astrometric errors for separations $<1^{\prime}$ is used to estimate the variance of turbulence distortions. On average, for DES, the post-GPR variance is $\sim 12 \times$ smaller than the pre-GPR variance. Application of the GPR to LSST is hence equivalent, for brighter stars and asteroids, to having 12 Rubin observatories running simultaneously. The expected improvement in the RMS of turbulence displacement errors is the square root of this value, $\sim 3.5.$ The post-GPR RMS displacement decreases with the density of reference stars as $\sim n_\star^{-0.5}$ for noiseless LSST simulations, and $\sim n_\star^{-0.3}$ for DES data.

 - **Abstract**
 The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe mHz gravitational waves from a wide variety of astrophysical sources. Of these, some will be characterizable as individual deterministic signals; the remainder will overlap to create astrophysical confusion noise. These sources of confusion noise are known as stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs). LISA data is expected to include several such astrophysical SGWBs, including the notable Galactic binary foreground, SGWBs from white dwarf binary populations in satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, and the SGWB from extragalactic stellar-origin binary black holes far from merger. To characterize these astrophysical signals and attempt to seek out possible underlying backgrounds of cosmological origin, it will be necessary to separate the contribution of each SGWB from that of the others. Crucially, several of these SGWBs are expected to be highly anisotropic on the sky, providing a powerful tool for spectral separation. To this end, we present BLIP 2.0: a flexible, GPU-accelerated framework for simulation and Bayesian analysis of arbitrary combinations of isotropic and anisotropic SGWBs. We leverage these capabilities to demonstrate for the first time spectral separation of the Galactic foreground, the Large Magellanic Cloud SGWB, and the SGWB from extragalactic stellar-origin binaries, and show a proof-of-concept for placing upper limits on the detection of an underlying isotropic cosmological SGWB in the presence of multiple astrophysical foregrounds.

#### On the Transients Handler for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is a next-generation gamma-ray observatory in both the Southern (Paranal, Chile) and Northern Hemisphere (La Palma, Spain) and will consist of up to 100 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. With sensitivity far exceeding current facilities, CTAO will provide detailed measurements of gamma rays from GeV up to a few 100s of TeV. CTAO has a nominal field of view of 10° and will rely on external alerts from observatories such as IceCube (neutrinos), Fermi-LAT (GeV gamma rays), LIGO (gravitational waves (GWs)) or the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory (optical) to trigger observations of targets of opportunity (ToOs). The Transients Handler (TH) is a subsystem of the Array Control and Data Acquisition that will provide the means of handling alerts and schedule follow-up observations. The TH is responsible for (i) filtering of thousands of internal and external alerts per night, (ii) processing of alerts according to the corresponding observation proposal to determine the optimal observation schedule with minimum interruptions to observations and (iii) broadcasting of events detected by CTAO to external facilities. In this work, we will discuss the architecture of the Transients Handler, its latest improvements and future updates

#### New gravitational-wave data support a bimodal black-hole mass distribution

 - **Abstract**
 Detailed stellar evolution and supernova models yield a bimodal black-hole mass distribution with a narrow peak around 10 solar masses from stars within a narrow range of progenitor properties and a second broader peak starting around 20 solar masses from very massive progenitors. This bimodal black-hole mass distribution leads to a characteristic distribution of chirp masses of merging binary black holes, with two main peaks arising from the merger of two black holes where both come either from the low- or the high-mass peak and a smaller peak in between from the mixed merger of a low-mass and a high-mass black hole. We carry out a population synthesis study of binary black hole formation and compare the results to the observed chirp masses of gravitational-wave events. We find that only the bimodal black-hole mass prescription is able to reproduce the structure of peaks and gaps in the observed chirp-mass distribution, which is not matched by predictions from other remnant mass prescriptions in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect is associated with galaxy clusters - extremely large and dense structures tracing the dark matter with a higher bias than isolated galaxies. We propose to use the tSZ data to separate galaxies from redshift surveys into distinct subpopulations corresponding to different densities and biases independently of the redshift survey systematics. Leveraging the information from different environments, as in density-split and density-marked clustering, is known to tighten the constraints on cosmological parameters, like $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$ and neutrino mass. We use data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in their region of overlap to demonstrate informative tSZ splitting of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). We discover a significant increase in the large-scale clustering of DESI LRGs corresponding to detections starting from 1-2 sigma in the ACT DR6 + Planck tSZ Compton-$y$ map, below the cluster candidate threshold (4 sigma). We also find that such galaxies have higher line-of-sight coordinate (and velocity) dispersions and a higher number of close neighbors than both the full sample and near-zero tSZ regions. We produce simple simulations of tSZ maps that are intrinsically consistent with galaxy catalogs and do not include systematic effects, and find a similar pattern of large-scale clustering enhancement with tSZ effect significance. Moreover, we observe that this relative bias pattern remains largely unchanged with variations in the galaxy-halo connection model in our simulations. This is promising for future cosmological inference from tSZ-split clustering with semi-analytical models. Thus, we demonstrate that valuable cosmological information is present in the lower signal-to-noise regions of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich map, extending far beyond the individual cluster candidates.

#### Cosmo-Learn: code for learning cosmology using different methods and mock data

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20971

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20971

 - **Abstract**
 We present cosmo_learn, an open-source python-based software package designed to simulate cosmological data and perform data-driven inference using a range of modern statistical and machine learning techniques. Motivated by the growing complexity of cosmological models and the emergence of observational tensions, cosmo_learn provides a standardized and flexible framework for benchmarking cosmological inference methods. The package supports realistic noise modeling for key observables in the late Universe, including cosmic chronometers, supernovae Ia, baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and gravitational wave bright sirens. We demonstrate the internal consistency of the simulated data with the input cosmology via residuals and parameter recovery using a fiducial $w$CDM model. Built-in learning and inference modules include traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo, as well as more recent approaches such as genetic algorithms, Gaussian processes, Bayesian ridge regression, and artificial neural networks. These methods are implemented in a modular and extensible architecture designed to facilitate comparisons across inference strategies in a common pipeline. By providing a flexible and transparent simulation and learning environment, cosmo_learn supports both educational and research efforts at the intersection of cosmology, statistics, and machine learning.

#### GW emission and relativistic dynamical friction in intermediate mass ratio inspirals

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20994

 - **Abstract**
 We present a set of preliminary simulations of intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) inside dark matter (DM) spikes accounting for post-Newtonian corrections the interaction between the two black holes up to the order 2.5 in $c^2$, as well as relativistic corrections to the dynamical friction (DF) force exerted by the DM distribution. We find that, incorporating relativity reduces of a factor $1/2$ the inspiral time, for equivalent initial orbital parameters, with respect to the purely classical estimates. Vice versa, neglecting the DF of the spike systematically yields longer inspiral times.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21054

 - **Abstract**
 We address various cosmological phenomenologies in the symmetric teleparallel framework both in background and perturbation such as cosmic expansion, gravitational coupling constant, gravitational waves propagation. Focusing on logarithmic extensions of $f(Q)$ models, we performed Bayesian analysis using the most-recent cosmological data, DESI DR2, Pantheon+. We also utilized a compilation of redshift space distortions ($f \sigma_8$) dataset to constrain the growth of structures in each of the models modulated by the effective gravitational coupling. We find that our extended Logarithmic $f(Q)$ models are well-constrained by the current cosmological data and are able to describe the late-time cosmic acceleration. The inverse Logarithmic model we introduce is also able to accommodate a phantom-like dark energy equation of state at late times, which is consistent with the recent DESI DR2 observations. We report explicitly predictions for the effective gravitational coupling ($\mu$), and the amplitude damping parameter of gravitational wave ($\nu$) solely based on the background data, which can be tested against future observations. While the two Log-based extensions we have introduced here perform equivalently on the background level, they provide contrasting predictions for the evolution of effective Gravitational constant and propagation of gravitational waves, which should be constrained against the future perturbation data.

#### Rapid late-time reionization: constraints and cosmological implications

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21069

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21069

 - **Abstract**
 We present constraints on the reionization optical depth, $\tau$, obtained using several independent methods. First, we perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the reionization history, using Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints on the evolution of the volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction, $x_\mathrm{HI}(z)$, including recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope. When combined with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI and Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraints, these data imply a rapid reionization history ($z_\mathrm{mid}=7.00^{+0.12}_{-0.18}$ and $\Delta z_{50}=1.12^{+0.12}_{-0.29}$) and a value of $\tau=0.0492^{+0.0014}_{-0.0030}$, which is largely insensitive to the assumed cosmological model and independent of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. The optical depth can also be measured from large-scale $(\ell<30)$ CMB polarization data, yielding constraints that are similarly model-insensitive and consistent with the Ly$\alpha$ bound. Third, $\tau$ may be constrained from the attenuation of small-scale $(\ell>30)$ CMB anisotropies, but the results are sensitive to the choice of cosmological model. Assuming $\Lambda$CDM and combining small-scale CMB data with CMB lensing and type 1a supernovae (SNe) yields tight constraints that are compatible with the Ly$\alpha$ bound. Adding galaxy clustering and lensing measurements brings the constraints further into agreement with the Ly$\alpha$ bound. These independent results reinforce a consensus picture in which reionization is rapid and late. However, the combination of small-scale CMB, CMB lensing, and BAO data yields $\tau=0.094\pm0.011$, which is in $4\sigma$ tension with our Ly$\alpha$ bound. Non-standard reionization scenarios can reconcile some but not all constraints. Concordance is restored in alternative cosmological models, such as models with dynamical dark energy favoured by BAO, CMB, and SNe data.

#### Alleviating the $H_0$ tension in Rastall gravity

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20129

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20129

 - **Abstract**
 The tension between measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ locally and the value inferred from Planck satellite have provided a strong motivation to explore theoretical frameworks beyond the standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM). To this aim, we investigate the $H_0$ tension in the Rastall $\Lambda$CDM model (R-$\Lambda$CDM), formulated within the Rastall gravity framework as a phenomenological extension of General Relativity featuring a non-conserved energy-momentum tensor. To constrain the cosmological parameters, we employ a comprehensive combined dataset including Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), Hubble parameter $H(z)$, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, and the growth rate of cosmic structures $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$. The estimation of model parameters is performed via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling within a Bayesian statistical framework. Our results show that the R-$\Lambda$CDM model, especially in closed geometry, reduces the $H_0$ tension, bringing the discrepancy with the local SH0ES measurements down to $1.97\sigma$ to $2.18\sigma$. However, the tension related to the $\sigma_8$ parameter remains unresolved.

#### Nonlinear diffusion in relativistic kinetic theory

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20147

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20147

 - **Abstract**
 A nonlinear Lorentz invariant kinetic diffusion equation is introduced, which is consistent with the conservation laws of particles number, energy and momentum. The equilibrium solution converges to the Maxwellian density in the Newtonian limit, but it is not given by the Jüttner distribution commonly employed in relativistic kinetic theory. The nonlinear kinetic diffusion equation on a general Lorentzian manifold is consistent with the contracted Bianchi identities and therefore can be coupled to the Einstein equations of general relativity.

#### Bondi-type accretion onto a Kerr black hole in the kinetic regime

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20189

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20189

 - **Abstract**
 We derive an exact solution representing a Bondi-type stationary accretion of a kinetic (Vlasov) gas onto the Kerr black hole. The solution is exact in the sense that relevant physical quantities, such as the particle current density or the accretion rates, are expressed as explicit integrals, which can be evaluated numerically. Whereas the angular momentum accretion rate is shown to vanish exactly, we provide an analytic approximation which allows us to obtain simple formulas for the mass and energy accretion rates. These formulas are used to derive characteristic time scales of the black hole mass growth and the associated spin-down in two different scenarios: assuming that the ambient energy density is either constant or decreases on a cosmological scale.

#### Chaos and Carter: Extreme-mass-ratio systems of relativistic rotating black holes in astrophysical environments

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20191

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals, where a stellar-mass object orbits a supermassive black hole, are prime sources of millihertz gravitational waves for upcoming space-based detectors. While most studies assume idealized vacuum backgrounds, realistic extreme-mass-ratio binaries are embedded in astrophysical environments, such as accretion disks, stellar clusters, or dark matter spikes, disks and halos, that can significantly alter the orbital dynamics. We explore bound geodesics around general-relativistic solutions describing rotating black holes surrounded by matter halos, for the first time, and map how environmental effects meddle with the spacetime symmetries of vacuum spinning (Kerr) black holes. In particular, we find that the loss of a Carter-like constant leads to geodesic non-integrability and the onset of chaos. This manifests through resonant island and chaotic layer formations around transient orbital resonances in phase space; features that are otherwise completely absent in integrable Kerr geodesics. Resonant islands, which are extended, non-zero volume regions in phase space, encapsulate periodic orbit points. Non-integrability ensures that the periodicity of the central resonant point is shared throughout the island's geodesics, thus effectively enhancing the lifespan of resonances, beyond Kerr-based predictions. Therefore, they can subject distinct imprint on gravitational-wave signals, with significant consequences for gravitational-wave modeling and parameter inference of astrophysical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.

#### Gravitational-wave tails and memory effect for mergers in astrophysical environments

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20238

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves from the coalescence of compact objects carry information about their dynamics and the spacetime in regions where they are evolving. In particular, late-time tails and memory effects after the merger are two low-frequency phenomena, not detectable by current instruments, but which can be observed by future detectors. Their low-frequency nature could, in principle, make them more sensitive to larger-scale structures at galactic length scales. We show that indeed there are transient features, such as amplitude changes, in both tails and (linear) memory when the merger occurs while immersed in an astrophysical environment. For realistic galaxies, the environment's compactness is small enough that the effect is strongly suppressed, but these effects could become relevant for mergers occurring in regions with matter overdensities, like the ones recently observed numerically for wave dark matter. On the other hand, the memory (the difference between the amplitude asymptotically early and late) and asymptotically late decay are independent on the properties of the environment.

 - **Abstract**
 The (degenerate) geometry of event horizons is linked to Carrollian fluids. We investigate the behavior of event horizons via a perturbative coupling to a massless scalar field, making connections to Carrollian hydrodynamics with a driving source, and discuss the fluid equilibration in tandem with the horizon's relaxation to equilibrium. We observe that after the perturbation dies off, the Carrollian fluid energy and momentum densities approach equilibrium as the horizon asymptotically becomes non-expanding. We connect the equilibration of the Carrollian fluid dual to the black hole horizon through the expansion of its background geometry.

#### On black holes in new general relativity

 - **Abstract**
 New General Relativity (NGR) is a class of teleparallel theories defined by three free parameters, effectively reduced to two after appropriate normalization, which are subject to experimental constraints. In this framework, matter couples minimally to the metric, ensuring that test particles follow geodesics and that null congruence expansions can be employed to detect local horizons. Assuming such horizons exist, we demonstrate that all physically viable NGR models--including the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR) and the one-parameter Hayashi and Shirafuji model (1P-H&S)--inevitably exhibit divergences in torsion scalars at the local horizon. This singular behavior obstructs the interpretation of these models and their associated teleparallel geometries as black hole configurations.

#### The Warp Drive: Superluminal Travel within General Relativity

 - **Abstract**
 In 1994, Miguel Alcubierre proposed that the well-known special relativistic limitation that particles cannot travel with velocities higher than light speed can be bypassed when such trips are considered globally within specific general relativistic frameworks, using a warped region of spacetime in the shape of a bubble that transports particles with mass traveling through spacetime with superluminal speed. Although initial results indicated this scenario as nonphysical, since it would seem to require negative mass-energy density, recent theoretical analyses suggest that such a nonphysical situation may not always be true. This thesis presents newfound solutions for the Einstein field equations, considering the Alcubierre warp drive spacetime metrics. The central premise is to study the fluid matter as the gravity source, rather than the more common vacuum or negative energy sources, to explore the potential for generating superluminal velocities, or \textit{warp speeds}, through a warped region in the spacetime. Such solutions have various matter-energy sources: dust particles, perfect fluid, quasi-perfect fluid with anisotropic pressures, charged dust, and a perfect fluid within a cosmological constant spacetime. A connection between some of these solutions featuring shock waves described by a Burgers-type equation with a term on the right-hand side of the equation purely dependent on time is also shown. This could mean warp drives are closely related to vacuum energy and possibly have topological effects such as shock waves.

#### Spinning Effective-to-Backwards One Body ($\texttt{SEBOB}$): combining Effective One-Body inspirals and Backwards One-Body merger-ringdowns for aligned spin black hole binaries

 - **Abstract**
 High-fidelity gravitational waveform models are essential for realizing the scientific potential of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories. While highly accurate, state-of-the-art models often rely on extensive phenomenological calibrations to numerical relativity (NR) simulations for the late-inspiral and merger phases, which can limit physical insight and extrapolation to regions where NR data is sparse. To address this, we introduce the Spinning Effective-to-Backwards One Body (SEBOB) formalism, a hybrid approach that combines the well-established Effective-One-Body (EOB) framework with the analytically-driven Backwards-One-Body (BOB) model, which describes the merger-ringdown from first principles as a perturbation of the final remnant black hole. We present two variants building on the state-of-the-art $\texttt{SEOBNRv5HM}$ model: $\texttt{seobnrv5_nrnqc_bob}$, which retains standard NR-calibrated non-quasi-circular (NQC) corrections and attaches a BOB-based merger-ringdown; and a more ambitious variant, $\texttt{seobnrv5_bob}$, which uses BOB to also inform the NQC corrections, thereby reducing reliance on NR fitting and enabling higher-order ($\mathcal{C}^2$) continuity by construction. Implemented in the open-source $\texttt{NRPy}$ framework for optimized C-code generation, the SEBOB model is transparent, extensible, and computationally efficient. By comparing our waveforms to a large catalog of NR simulations, we demonstrate that SEBOB yields accuracies comparable to the highly-calibrated $\texttt{SEOBNRv5HM}$ model, providing a viable pathway towards more physically motivated and robust waveform models

 - **Abstract**
 We compute the canonical (brick wall) entropy of Hawking radiation in a quantum black hole whose exterior is described, to first order in a small quadrupole parameter, by the static $q$-metric, which is an exact vacuum solution of the Einstein equations. Counting near horizon quasinormal modes shows that a modest quadrupolar deformation self-regularizes the ultraviolet divergence: the entropy of Hawking radiation is finite for any non-vanishing quadrupole, without an ad hoc cutoff. Matching this canonical entropy to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy leads to no-hair violating multipoles, at percent-to-tens-of-percent level, and provides concrete observational targets for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).

 - **Abstract**
 The curvature singularity problem in $f(R)$ dark energy models poses a significant challenge to their viability as alternatives to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. In this work, we investigate the possibility of resolving this issue by incorporating higher-order corrections that are compatible with the inflationary phase. We analyze the effects of adding $R^2$, $R^{\frac{m+2}{m+1}}$ and $\alpha$-attractor representation in $f(R)$ gravity terms to types of dark energy $f(R)$ models, focusing on their ability to prevent singularities in high-density environments. Our results demonstrate that these corrections can effectively stabilize the models, ensuring their consistency across both inflationary and late-time cosmological scales.

 We investigate dynamics of the conformal scalar equation with defocusing cubic nonlinearity and Robin boundary conditions on the Reissner-Nordström-anti-de Sitter background. At certain parts of the parameters phase space the zero solution ceases to be stable. We present two mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon.

 - **Abstract**
 TianQin is a proposed space-based gravitational wave detector mission that employs inter-satellite laser interferometry. Suppressing measurement noise and achieving high sensitivity require accurate alignment of multiple onboard interferometers after laser link acquisition. However, due to huge armlengths and varying point-ahead angles, the fine alignment of the transmitted beams can be particularly challenging, which needs to take into account both received laser power and far-field wavefront errors. To tackle this issue for TianQin which has small point-ahead angle variations, we propose an efficient alignment strategy that relies on finding the maximum-intensity direction of the transmitted beam as the alignment reference. The direction can be estimated through a quatrefoil scan of the local transmitted beam and the corresponding intensity measurement from the remote satellite. Under TianQin's fixed-value compensation of the point-ahead angles, simulation results reveal that the proposed strategy is capable of aligning the transmitted beams within 20 nrad from the mean value of the point-ahead angles, while the tilt-to-length coupling associated with far-field wavefront error can meet the requirement given a transmitted beam aberration of $\lambda/40$ RMS.

 - **Abstract**
 We study quantum corrections to the $\Lambda$CDM model model arising from a minimum measurable length in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. We focus on a higher-order Generalized Uncertainty Principle, beyond the quadratic form. This generalized GUP introduces two free parameters, and we determine the modified Friedmann equation. This framework leads to a perturbative cosmological model that naturally reduces to $\Lambda$CDM in an appropriate limiting case of the deformation parameters. We construct the modified cosmological scenario, analyze its deviations from the standard case, and examine it as a mechanism for the description of dynamical dark energy. To constrain the model, we employ Cosmic Chronometers, the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the DESI DR2 release, and Supernova data from the PantheonPlus and Union3 catalogues. Our analysis indicates that the modified GUP model is statistically competitive with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario, providing comparable or even improved fits to some of the combined datasets. Moreover, the data constrain the deformation parameter of the GUP model, with the preferred value found to be negative, which corresponds to a phantom regime in the effective dynamical dark energy description.

 - **Abstract**
 The singularities present at the centre of black holes signal a break down of the classical theory. In this paper, we demonstrate a resolution of the Schwarzschild-(Anti-)de Sitter singularity by imposing unitary evolution with respect to unimodular time. Employing the Henneaux-Teitelboim formulation of unimodular gravity, we perform a canonical quantization on a symmetry-reduced Schwarzschild-(Anti-) de Sitter model. This leads to a Wheeler-DeWitt equation that effectively becomes a Schrödinger equation in unimodular time. By imposing unitarity, we discover a family of quantum theories in which the classical singularity is resolved. These theories each allow only semiclassical states corresponding to one mass sign: either positive, negative, or zero. Furthermore, we derive an analytical expression for the quantum-corrected Schwarzschild metric, which is modified by a new length scale $r_{min}$ that governs the black hole's transition to a white hole.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we obtain and study images of accretion disks around static spherically symmetric black holes in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity. Semi-analytic ray-tracing methods in curved spacetime are employed to generate the images of the disk for different scalar field configurations, including both Higgs-type potentials and cases without a potential. The resulting images, including both redshift and intensity maps, are analyzed. The results show that the scalar field parameters play a significant role in shaping both the direct and secondary images of the disk, while the inclination angle primarily affects the asymmetry and brightness distribution. In particular, configurations with extreme scalar field values lead to cooler and dimmer disk compared to General Relativity. Furthermore, the structure and angular size of the secondary ring exhibit noticeable deviations from General Relativity, offering a potential observational signature. Through direct comparison between hybrid metric-Palatini gravity and General Relativity images, we conclude that future high-resolution observations of black hole shadows could effectively distinguish this modified gravitational theory and constrain underlying scalar field parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The scalar perturbations of thick braneworld models provide critical insights into their matter-geometry relationship, distinct from tensor modes. This work systematically investigates quasinormal modes and gravitational echoes from scalar perturbations in a thick brane model exhibiting internal structure and brane splitting. Using the WKB method, direct integration, and Bernstein spectral techniques, we compute quasinormal frequencies across different parameter regimes, addressing both single and double-barrier effective potentials. Time-domain evolution of wave packets reveals clear echo signals for split brane configurations ($s > 1, \delta > 1$), produced by successive reflections between sub-branes. A key finding is the position-dependence of echo modes within the extra dimension: observers located on a sub-brane detect clean periodic signals, whereas those situated between sub-branes observe more complex, modulated waveforms. This effect offers a distinct signature of the brane's internal structure. The observed echoes, along with consistent frequency- and time-domain results, advance the understanding of thick brane dynamics and open an observational window into warped extra dimensions. Moreover, the similarity between the effective potential in thick brane scenarios and those of black holes and wormholes offers valuable perspectives for studying echo-related phenomena in these gravitational systems.

 - **Abstract**
 It was recently shown that a black hole (or any Killing horizon) will decohere any quantum superposition in their vicinity. I review three distinct but equivalent arguments that illustrate how this phenomenon arises: (1) entanglement with "degrees of freedom" in the interior (2) the absorption of soft, entangling radiation emitted by the superposition and (3) interactions with the quantum, fluctuating multipole moments of a black hole arising from ultra low frequency Hawking quanta. The relationship between "soft hair" and interactions with "internal degrees of freedom" is emphasized and some implications for the nature of horizons in a quantum theory of gravity are discussed.
