 - **Abstract**
 In Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data analysis, noise is typically assumed to be Gaussian, and the marginalized likelihood has a well-established analytical form derived within the framework of Gaussian processes. However, this Gaussianity assumption may break down for certain classes of astrophysical and cosmological signals, particularly for a gravitational wave background (GWB) generated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). In this work, we present a new method for testing the presence of non-Gaussian features in PTA data. We go beyond the Gaussian assumption by modeling the noise or signal statistics using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). An advantage of this approach is that the marginalization of the likelihood remains fully analytical, expressed as a linear combination of Gaussian PTA likelihoods. This makes the method straightforward to implement within existing data analysis tools. Moreover, this method extends beyond the free spectrum analysis by producing posterior probability distributions of higher-order moments inferred from the data, which can be incorporated into spectral refitting techniques. We validate the model using simulations and demonstrate the sensitivity of PTAs to non-Gaussianity by computing the Bayes factor in favor of the GMM as a function of the injected excess moments. We apply the method to a more astrophysically motivated scenario where a single SMBHB is resolved on top of a Gaussian GWB and show that significant non-Gaussianities are introduced by the individual source. Finally, we test our model on a realistic GWB generated from a simulated population of SMBHBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events are rare and diverse transients that occur when a star is torn apart by a supermassive black hole and accreted, which can result in a supersoft X-ray thermal transient. Here, we present nine tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates identified in eROSITA-DE Data Release 1 through a novel search for such supersoft sources. We select candidates by comparing the catalogued count rates in several combinations of bands and evaluate the nature of selected sources to produce our sample, among which five are entirely new X-ray TDE candidates. All our candidates' X-ray spectra are consistent with soft thermal emission and we show them to have faded through additional Swift observations and catalogued data. We investigate publicly available data from ground- and space-based telescopes and find two of our sources have optical counterparts and four sources show flaring in their NEOWISE IR light curves. The high proportion of our sources with IR flares compared to optically selected TDE samples could suggest a link between supersoft X-ray spectra and IR counterparts. We fit the IR light curves with a model of a spherical dust shell heated by the TDE and find these results to be broadly consistent with those of other TDEs with IR counterparts. Finally, we examine the host galaxies and show them to be similar to the general TDE host population.

#### Evolution of linear matter perturbations with error-bounded bundle physics-informed neural networks
 - **Authors:** Luca Gomez Bachar, Augusto T. Chantada, Susana J. Landau, Claudia G. Scóccola, Pavlos Protopapas

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08443

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08443

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the evolution of linear matter perturbations in the context of the standard cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM) and a phenomenological modified gravity model. We use the physics-informed neural network (PINN) bundle method, which allows to integrate differential systems as an alternative to the traditional numerical method. We apply the PINN bundle method to the equation that describes the matter perturbation evolution, to compare its outcomes with recent data on structure growth, $f\sigma_8$. Unlike our previous works, we can calculate a bound on the error of this observable without using the numerical solution of the equation. For this, we use a method developed previously by ourselves to calculate an exact bound on the PINN-based solution using only the outcomes of the network and its residual. On the other hand, the use of an updated data set allows us to obtain more stringent constraints on the plane $\Omega_m-\sigma_8$ than previous works.

#### Oscillations and parity violation in gravitational wave background from extra tensor modes

 - **Abstract**
 Spectator fields which provide additional tensor degrees of freedom, on top of the standard metric tensor perturbations, can produce significant amounts of gravitational waves (GWs). Employing the effective field theory approach for spin-2 fields, we find a universal prediction that linear mixing between the metric and extra tensor modes inevitably induces oscillatory features in the GW spectrum, reminiscent of the so-called neutrino oscillation. Moreover, parity-violating operators in the spin-2 sector can imprint chiral signatures on the resulting GW background. We consider a concrete scenario in which the spin-2 field generates observable chiral GWs with characteristic oscillatory patterns. These results provide a model-independent characterization of the key signatures and observational implications of such scenarios which can be detected with future GW detectors.

#### Particle physics models of interacting bosonic dark energy and fermionic dark matter in Einstein scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08638

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08638

 - **Abstract**
 We explore a cosmological framework in which a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field, acting as dark energy, interacts with a fermionic dark matter field through a coupling obtained from the point of view of particle physics. This setup is inspired by string/M-theory, and two representative scalar field potentials are investigated: exponential and power-law. A distinctive feature of the GB-coupled models is their potential to alter the propagation speed of gravitational waves (GWs), a property with significant implications in light of recent multi-messenger astrophysical observations. To account for this, we analyze models under two scenarios: one where the GW speed differs from that of light and the other where they are equal, but all consistent with current observational constraints. The dynamical evolution of the system is investigated by reformulating the field equations into an autonomous dynamical system, enabling a detailed analysis of the Universe's long-term behavior, including the radiation-, matter- and dark energy-dominated epochs. We constrain the model parameters using a broad set of recent observational data, including mock high-redshift measurements from the Roman Space Telescope. Our findings indicate that both potentials yield cosmologies that are in excellent agreement with current data, closely tracking the expansion history predicted by the standard \(\Lambda\)CDM model, while still allowing room for subtle deviations that could be tested by future observations.

#### Halo Occupation Distribution of Quasars: Dependence on Luminosity, Redshift, Black Hole Mass and Feedback Modes
 - **Authors:** Anirban Chowdhary, Suchetana Chatterjee

 - **Abstract**
 We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA) to explore the redshift, luminosity, and black hole mass dependence of the quasar halo occupation distribution (HOD). In both simulations, we find that the quasar activity is quenched at a characteristic halo mass ($\sim 10^{13} M_{\odot}$) scale affecting the nature of its occupation distribution function. We note that the quenching is more pronounced at low redshifts for quasars selected through a luminosity threshold. We show that a very significant bias ({\bf a factor of $\sim 10-50$ in the central occupation and $\sim 10-70\%$ in the satellite occupation fraction}) is introduced in the reconstruction of quasar host halo mass distributions from the observed two-point-correlation function, if the HOD modeling does not account for the quenching effect in the central occupation function. While there is strong suppression of the occupation fraction of central quasars, the satellite occupation still follows a power-law like behavior. Our results show that the global satellite fraction of quasars increases monotonically from high to low redshifts, with $20-40 \%$ of the quasars being satellite at intermediate redshifts, consistent with previous clustering based estimates. In addition, our study reveals that while the occupation function of quasars depends on redshift, luminosity, and feedback modes, there is hardly any evolution in the supermassive black hole (SMBH; mass-selected sample) occupation. The SMBH HOD over the entire parameter space is well-modeled by a power-law and a step function similar to what has been found for galaxies and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.

#### Where are Gaia's small black holes?

 - **Abstract**
 Gaia has recently revealed a population of over 20 compact objects in wide astrometric binaries, while LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) have observed around 100 compact object binaries as gravitational-wave (GW) mergers. Despite belonging to different systems, the compact objects discovered by both Gaia and the LVK follow a multimodal mass distribution, with a global maximum at neutron star (NS) masses ($\sim 1$-$2\,M_\odot$) and a secondary local maximum at black hole (BH) masses $\sim10\,M_\odot$. However, the relative dearth of objects, or ``mass gap," between these modes is more pronounced among the wide binaries observed by Gaia compared to the GW population, with $9^{+10}_{-6}\%$ of GW component masses falling between $2.5$--$5\,M_\odot$ compared to $\lesssim5\%$ of Gaia compact objects. We explore whether this discrepancy can be explained by the natal kicks received by low-mass BHs. GW progenitor binaries may be more likely to survive natal kicks, because the newborn BH has a more massive companion and/or is in a tighter binary than Gaia progenitor binaries. We compare the survival probabilities of Gaia and GW progenitor binaries as a function of natal kick strength and pre-supernova binary parameters, and map out the parameter space and kick strength required to disrupt the progenitor binaries leading to low-mass BHs in Gaia systems more frequently than those in GW systems.

#### Constraints on the varying electron mass and early dark energy in light of ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 and the implications for inflation

 - **Abstract**
 Primarily motivated by the Hubble tension, we analyze the varying electron mass model and axionlike early dark energy model (EDE) using baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2 data and including the recent results from ACT DR6. Our analysis indicates that $m_{e} / m_{e0} = 1.0081 \pm 0.0046 $ and the energy fraction of EDE is constrained as $f_\mathrm{EDE} < 0.016$. Since those cosmological models fit with different spectral index $n_s$, we show the posterior of those models on the ($n_s-r$) plane and point out that, for example, Starobinsky inflation works for varying electron mass model while the standard supersymmetric hybrid inflation is preferred in the EDE model.

#### Multi-Energy and Multi-Sample Searches for Neutrinos from GW Events

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole detects neutrinos of astrophysical origin via their interactions with ice. The main array is optimized for the detection of neutrinos with energies above 1 TeV. A much smaller infill array, known as IceCube DeepCore, extends the sensitivity down to a few GeV. Neutrinos observed in both parts of the detector are used for astrophysical-source searches with multiple messengers. We present two analyses that follow up archival gravitational wave (GW) events from runs O1 through O3 of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. The first analysis uses two neutrino datasets: one with high-energy tracks and another consisting of low-energy tracks and cascades. These two neutrino datasets were previously used independently to follow-up GW events. In the analysis presented here, a combined likelihood search is performed using both datasets to search for neutrinos coincident with the GW events across a wide energy range, from a few GeV to several PeV. The second analysis, for the first time, uses a neutrino-induced cascade sample with events of energy above ~1 TeV for searches of coincident neutrino-GW emission. We present results from both analyses and discuss prospects for conducting these analyses in real time.

#### Measurement of Parity-Violating Modes of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 1 Luminous Red Galaxies' 4-Point Correlation Function

 - **Abstract**
 Here we report the first measurement of the parity-violating (PV) 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's Year 1 Luminous Red Galaxy (DESI Y1 LRG) sample, motivated by the potential detection of the PV 4PCF in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (SDSS BOSS) galaxies. In our auto-correlation ("auto") analysis, we find a statistically significant excess of the PV signal compared to mocks without any PV, at 4-10$\sigma$ depending on details of the analysis. This could arise either from genuine PV or from an underestimation of the variance in the mocks; it is unlikely to arise, at the signal level, from a systematic. We then cross-correlate ("cross") the putative PV signal between different, independent patches of sky, and there find no detection of parity violation. The two measurements are in significant tension: while the cross has somewhat larger error bars than the auto, this is not sufficient to explain the discrepancy. We thus present the current work as an intriguing addition to the PV work on BOSS and as motivation for exploring further the relationship between the auto and cross PV 4PCF analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Some approaches to Quantum Gravity (QG) entail decoherence of quantum matter propagating in it, due to an ``environment'' of QG degrees of freedom inaccessible to low-energy observers. In the first part of this talk, I discuss potential, and rather unique, effects of QG-induced decoherence on entangled particle states, specifically an induced modification of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations of entangled neutral-meson states in meson factories ($\omega$-effect). In the second part, I summarise a recent work in which axion-like fields, forming a kind of condensate clouds surrounding rotating (Kerr-type) astrophysical black holes, can lead to superradiant instabilities, and, through these, to the production of EPR-like entangled states of gravitons, with the entanglement pertaining to (left, right) polarisation degrees of freedom. In the presence of axions and Kerr geometries, there are non-trivial gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS)-type anomalous terms in the respective low-energy gravitational effective actions. Depending on whether the graviton entanglement is due to the non-anomalous terms (of General-Relativity type) in the effective action, or to the gCS terms, one obtains different structures of the resulting entangled squeezed-graviton states, which resemble somewhat the $\omega$-effect.

 - **Abstract**
 Spinning black holes could produce ultralight particles via the superradiance instability. These particles form a dense cloud around the host black hole, introducing new opportunities for the detection of ultralight new physics. When the black hole is part of a binary system, the binary can trigger transitions among different states of the cloud configuration. Such transitions backreact on the orbital dynamics, modifying the frequency evolution of the emitted gravitational waves. Based on this observation, black hole binaries were proposed as a way to test the existence of ultralight particles. We investigate the effects of the self-gravity of the cloud on the orbital evolution and on the gravitational wave emission. We find that cloud self-gravity could lead to a density-dependent modification of the energy levels of ultralight particles and that it could alter the order of hyperfine energy levels. The crossing of hyperfine levels prevents binaries from triggering resonant hyperfine transitions and allows them to approach radii that could trigger resonant transitions of fine levels. We study the implications of these findings, especially in the context of future space-borne gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). For quasi-circular, prograde and equatorial orbits, we find that LISA could probe ultralight particles in the mass range $10^{-15}\,{\rm eV} \, - \, 10^{-13}\, {\rm eV}$ through gravitational wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 In the field of gravitational wave science, next-generation detectors will be substantially more accurate than the current suite of detectors. Numerical relativity simulations of binary black hole (BBH) gravitational waveforms must become faster, more efficient, and more accurate to be used in analyses of these next-generation detections. One approach, which the \texttt{SpECTRE} code employs, is using spectral methods for accuracy along with synchronous task-based parallelism to avoid idle time in simulations and make the most efficient use of computational resources. When writing an asynchronous application, algorithms must be redesigned compared to their synchronous counterparts. To illustrate this process, we present novel methods for dynamically tracking the apparent horizons in evolutions of BBH mergers using a feedback control system, all in the context of asynchronous parallelism. We also briefly detail how these methods can be applied to binary neutron star simulations performed with asynchronous parallelism.

#### Optical Phenomena in a Non-Commutative Kalb-Ramond Black Hole Spacetime

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08889

 - **Abstract**
 This work investigates additional gravitational features of a newly proposed black hole spacetime within Kalb-Ramond gravity, incorporating non-commutative corrections arising from a gauge-theoretic approach recently introduced in the literature [arXiv:2507.17390]. Accordingly, null geodesics are solved numerically to trace photon paths; the photon sphere and shadow are determined. From Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements of $Sgr A^{*}$, constraints on the parameters $\Theta$ (which encapsulates the non-commutativity) and $\ell$ (the Lorentz-violating parameter) are established. To examine the stability of critical orbits and the deflection angle (gravitational lensing) in the weak field scenario, we compute the Gaussian curvature in order to use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Moreover, the deflection angle has been calculated as well in the strong deflection limit. Furthermore, Lensing observables are estimated using EHT data for $Sgr A^{*}$ and $M87$. Topological features such as the topological photon sphere are also explored.

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08936

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08936

 - **Abstract**
 The Stewart-Tolman effect posits that accelerating conductors exhibit both charge separation and rest-frame electric fields (``inertia of charge''), while the Ehrenfest-Tolman effect states that acceleration induces temperature gradients (``inertia of heat''). We study the interplay of these effects in thermodynamic equilibrium. Specifically, we derive from first principles a partial differential equation governing the electrothermal stratification of a fully ionized plasma in equilibrium under irrotational relativistic accelerations in curved spacetime. We then solve it in two settings: a plasma enclosed in a uniformly accelerated box, and a plasma shell suspended above a black hole horizon. The resulting electric fields are found not to depend on the electric conductivity of the medium.

#### Comments on the Hyperboloidal Foliation for Black Hole Quasinormal Modes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09031

 - **Abstract**
 In this brief note, we demonstrate that the hyperboloidal foliation technique, applied to the study of black hole quasinormal modes, where the spatial boundary is shifted from spacelike infinity to the future event horizon and null infinity, is effectively equivalent to the conventional approach, in which the asymptotic wave function typically diverges at both ends of spatial infinity. Specifically, although perhaps counterintuitive, a given hyperboloidal slicing, corresponding to a particular choice of coordinates, always uniquely determines a scheme for extracting the wave function, dictated by the asymptotic behavior of the master equation at the spatial boundary. It follows that the efficiency and precision observed in evaluating the quasinormal modes should be attributed primarily to other factors, such as the use of Chebyshev grids.

#### Extremal Black Holes from Homotopy Algebras

 - **Abstract**
 The uniqueness and rigidity of black holes remain central themes in gravitational research. In this work, we investigate the construction of all extremal black hole solutions to the Einstein equation for a given near-horizon geometry, employing the homotopy algebraic perspective, a powerful and increasingly influential framework in both classical and quantum field theory. Utilising Gaußian null coordinates, we recast the deformation problem as an analysis of the homotopy Maurer-Cartan equation associated with an $L_\infty$-algebra. Through homological perturbation theory, we systematically solve this equation order by order in directions transverse to the near-horizon geometry. As a concrete application of this formalism, we examine the deformations of the extremal Kerr horizon. Notably, this homotopy-theoretic approach enables us to characterise the moduli space of deformations by studying only the lowest-order solutions, offering a systematic way to understand the landscape of extremal black hole geometries.
