 - **Abstract**
 We perform a frequentist analysis using the standard profile likelihood method for clustering measurements from Data Release 1 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). While Bayesian inferences for Effective Field Theory models of galaxy clustering can be highly sensitive to the choice of priors for extended cosmological models, frequentist inferences are not susceptible to such effects. We compare Bayesian and frequentist constraints for the parameter set $\{\sigma_8, H_0, \Omega_{\rm{m}}, w_0, w_a\}$ when fitting to the full-shape of the power spectrum multipoles, the post-reconstruction Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, as well as external datasets from the CMB and type Ia supernovae measurements. Bayesian prior effects are very significant for the $w_0w_a$CDM model; while the $1 \sigma$ frequentist confidence intervals encompass the maximum a posteriori (MAP), the Bayesian credible intervals almost always exclude the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and the MAP - indicating strong prior volume projection effects - unless supernovae data are included. We observe limited prior effects for the $\Lambda$CDM model, due to the reduced number of parameters. When DESI full-shape and BAO data are jointly fit, we obtain the following $1\sigma$ frequentist confidence intervals for $\Lambda$CDM ($w_0w_a$CDM): $\sigma_8 = 0.867^{+0.048}_{-0.041} , \ H_0 = 68.91^{+0.80}_{-0.79} \ \rm{km \ s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}} , \ \Omega_{\rm{m}} = 0.3038\pm0.0110$ ($\sigma_8 = 0.793^{+0.069}_{-0.048} , \ H_0 = 64.9^{+4.8}_{-2.8} \ \rm{km \ s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}} , \ \Omega_{\rm{m}} = 0.369^{+0.029}_{-0.059}$ , $w_0 = -0.24^{+0.17}_{-0.64}$ , $w_a = -2.5^{+1.9}_{}$), corresponding to 0.7$\sigma$, 0.3$\sigma$, 0.7$\sigma$ (1.9$\sigma$, 3.4$\sigma$, 5.6$\sigma$, 5.5$\sigma$, 5.6$\sigma$) shifts between the MLE relative to the Bayesian posterior mean for $\Lambda$CDM ($w_0w_a$CDM) respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EoS) and nuclear properties achievable with third-generation gravitational wave detectors using the Fisher information matrix approach. Assuming an optimistic binary neutron star (BNS) merger rate, we generate synthetic inspiral gravitational wave (GW) signals corresponding to one year of observation. From these simulated data, we compute the covariance matrix and posterior distributions for nuclear properties and EoS. Our results show that the EoS can be tightly constrained, particularly in the density range between one and four times nuclear saturation density. However, due to the scarcity of of low-mass neutron stars in the GW sample, the EoS at sub-saturation densities remains poorly constrained. Thus, in turn, leads to weaker constraints on neutron star radii, as the radii are sensitive to the low-density EoS. Additionally, We note that the nuclear properties are degenerate in their influence on the EoS, making them difficult to be constrained through GW observations alone. These highlights inherent limitations of inspiral GW signals in probing dense matter properties. Therefore, precise radius measurements, post-merger GW observations, and supplementary constraints from terrestrial nuclear experiments remain essential for a comprehensive understanding of dense matter.

 - **Abstract**
 When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}>10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.063_{-0.047}^{+0.058}$ or $0.134_{-0.040}^{+0.050}$ for $7\text{ or }8$ binaries with $g_{\rm N}<10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$ (depending on one system) showing tension with Newton. The Newtonian ``outlier'' is at the boundary set by the Newtonian escape velocity, but can be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.

#### The origin of extreme N-emitters in star-forming galaxies at z$<$0.5 with DESI DR1

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme nitrogen enhancement relative to oxygen, recently found in very high-redshift galaxies, has been seen in local star-forming galaxies displaying high log(N/O) values ($\geq\!-1.1$) at relatively low O abundances, 12+log(O/H)$\leq$8. Understanding the physical origins of these extreme N-emitters at low redshifts enables us to better constrain chemical enrichment mechanisms that drove such high log(N/O) values in the early Universe. With direct N and O abundances derived for 944 SFGs with spectroscopic observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1), we report the discovery of 19 extreme N-emitters at low-z (z$<$0.5). Our sample of N-emitters represents a five-fold increase in their known number at low-z with 12+log(O/H)$\leq$8, and statistically, $2.21\pm0.91$\% of DESI DR1 SFGs with reliable O and N abundances obtained directly, are extreme N-emitters. The sample spans a mass range of $\sim 10^7$ - $10^{10}$~M$_{\odot}$ with 12+log(O/H) range of $\sim$7.1 - 8.2, and the N-emitter fraction is found to increase with increasing stellar mass and decreasing metallicity. The most extreme N-emitter in our sample has log(N/O)=$-0.53\pm0.13$, while also having the lowest 12+log(O/H)=$7.08\pm0.09$ and the highest stellar mass, log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$)=$9.95\pm0.13$ among our sample. With galactic chemical evolution models, we show that sustained N-enhancement by asymptotic giant branch stars, in conjunction with presence of outflows, can well explain the high log(N/O) of low-z extreme N-emitters. While single starbursts with outflow are sufficient to explain lower-mass N-emitters, more massive ones require a dual starburst scenario where a secondary starburst is triggered by inflow of gas.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) B-mode polarization provide a way to probe primordial gravitational waves and test inflationary predictions. Extragalactic point sources become a major source of contamination after delensing and can bias estimates of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ at the $10^{-3}$ level. We introduce Generalized Point Spread Function Fitting (GPSF), a method for removing point-source contamination in polarization maps. GPSF uses the full pixel-domain covariance, including off-diagonal terms, and models overlapping sources. This allows accurate flux estimation under realistic conditions, particularly for small-aperture telescopes with large beams that are more susceptible to source blending. We test GPSF on simulated sky maps, apply foreground cleaning using the Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC) method, and compare its performance with standard masking and inpainting. The results show GPSF reduces point-source contamination without significantly affecting the background signal, as seen in both the maps and their power spectra. For the constraint on $r$, GPSF reduces the bias from $1.67 \times 10^{-3}$ to $2.9 \times 10^{-4}$, with only a 2% increase in standard deviation. Compared to inpainting and masking, GPSF yields lower bias while maintaining comparable variance. This suggests that it may serve as a promising method for future CMB experiments targeting measurements of $r \sim 10^{-3}$.

#### Cosmology-informed Neural Networks to infer dark energy equation-of-state

 - **Abstract**
 We present a framework that combines physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference to constrain dynamical dark energy models using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation. First, we train a physics-informed neural network to learn the solution of the Friedmann equation and accurately reproduce the matter density term x_m(z) = Omega_m,0 (1+z)^3 across a range of Omega_m,0. For each of five two-parameter equation-of-state (EoS) forms: Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Linear-z, and Logarithmic-z, we derive the analytic dark energy factor x_de(z), embed the trained surrogate within a GPU-accelerated likelihood pipeline, and sample the posterior of (h0, Omega_m,0, w0, wa, M0) using the emcee ensemble sampler with the full Pantheon+ covariance. All parameterizations remain consistent with a cosmological constant (w0 = -1, wa = 0) at the 95% credible level, with the tightest bounds from the CPL form. While the surrogate does not reduce computation time for a single run in simple models, it becomes advantageous for repeated analyses of the same EoS or for models with expensive likelihood evaluations, and can be shared as a reusable tool with different datasets within the training range of SNe redshifts. This flexibility makes the approach a scalable tool for future cosmological inference, especially in regimes where conventional ODE-based methods are computationally prohibitive.

#### Long term variability of Cygnus X-1. IX. A spectral-timing comparison of Cygnus X-1 and MAXI J1820+070 in the hard state

 - **Abstract**
 Cygnus X-1 is a persistent, high-mass black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) which in the hard state shows many similar properties to transient BHXRBs, along with intriguing differences, such as the lack of quasi-periodic oscillations. Here, we compare for the first time the detailed spectral-timing properties of Cyg X-1 with a transient BHXRB, MAXI J1820+070, combining data from XMM-Newton and NICER with contemporaneous INTEGRAL data to study the power spectra, rms spectra and time-lags over a broad 0.5 - 200 keV range. We select bright hard state MAXI J1820+070 data with similar power-spectral shapes to the Cyg X-1 data, to compare the source behaviours while accounting for the evolution of spectral-timing properties, notably the lags, through the hard state. Cyg X-1 shows no evidence for soft lags in the 1 - 10 Hz frequency range where they are clearly detected for MAXI J1820+070. Furthermore the low-frequency hard lags and rms-spectra evolve much more strongly during the hard state of Cyg X-1 than for MAXI J1820+070. We argue that these differences cannot be explained by the different black hole masses of these systems, but may be related to their different accretion rates and corresponding locations on the hardness-intensity diagram. We conjecture that there is a significant luminosity-dependence of coronal geometry in the hard state of BHXRBs, rather than an intrinsic difference between Cyg X-1 and transient BHXRBs. This possibility has also been suggested to explain a common time-lag feature that appears in the hard intermediate states of Cyg X-1 and transient BHXRBs.

#### Origin of High Dark Remnant Fractions in Milky Way Globular Clusters: The Crucial Role of Initial Black Hole Retention

 - **Abstract**
 Comparing the dynamical and stellar masses of Milky Way (MW) globular clusters (GCs) reveals a discrepancy exceeding a factor of two. Since this substantial invisible mass is concentrated in the cluster centre, it is attributed to stellar remnants. The majority of mass in remnants consists of white dwarfs (WDs). Allocating over half of a GC's current mass to WDs could significantly restrict the dynamical evolution scenarios governing stellar clusters. As the most massive stars in GCs, black holes (BHs) exert a substantial effect on the escape rate of lower mass stars, such as WDs. This paper aims to identify which scenarios of BH natal kicks can accurately reproduce the notable dark remnant fraction observed in MW GCs. We compare the observed remnant fraction of MW GCs with a comprehensive grid of direct \Nbody simulations while adjusting the natal kick received by BHs. Our results reveal that simulations employing low natal kicks to BHs are the only ones capable of mirroring the remnant fraction of MW GCs. According to the Spitzer instability, the presence of a BH population prompts the formation of a BH sub-system (BHSub) at the centre of a star cluster. The BHSub serves as an energetic power plant, continually releasing kinetic energy through few-body encounters between single and binary BHs, and transferring the generated energy to the entire stellar population. This energy induces a significant difference in the ejection rate of stellar remnants and luminous stars, ultimately increasing the fraction of dark remnants within the star cluster.

#### How the cosmic voids contribute to stalling and quenching the giant galaxies on their surfaces

 - **Abstract**
 We report a numerical discovery that the formations of cosmic voids are closely linked with the mechanism through which the giant galaxies on void surfaces establish elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower sSFR. Identifying the voids from the TNG300-1 simulations via the Void-Finder algorithm, we explore if and how the shapes of the TNG galaxies located on void surfaces are aligned with the directions toward the void centers. Noting that only the giant void-surface galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\star}\ge 10^{10.5}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ exhibit significant tendency of perpendicular alignments, we dichotomize them into two $M_{\star}$-controlled samples according to their morphologies (elliptical or spiral), colors (redder or bluer), sSFR (lower or higher) and stellar ages (older or younger). It is found that the void-galaxy perpendicular alignment becomes stronger for the cases that the void-surface galaxies have elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower sSFR. The numerical results are also shown to be well described by the analytical one-parameter model derived under the assumption of the existence of a linear scaling between the covariance matrices of galaxy shape axes and local tidal tensors. Our result implies that the compression of adjacent matter due to the formation and rapid expansion of cosmic voids prevent them from radial infall/accretion, which in turn contribute to stalling and quenching the giant void-surface galaxies. Given that the formation epochs and expansion rates of cosmic voids depend sensitively on the dark energy equation of state, we also discuss a possibility of using the abundance of elliptical void-surface galaxies as a probe of dark energy.

#### On constraining initial orbital eccentricity of purely inspiral events

 - **Abstract**
 The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA consortium has sporadically detected purely inspiral gravitational-wave events like GW170817 and GW190425. These events offer an opportunity to constrain the presence of possible initial (residual) orbital eccentricities while using purely inspiral template families. We detail the implementation of a LSC Algorithm Library Suite approximant, TaylorF2Ecck, which models analytically inspiral gravitational waves from non-spinning compact binaries in Post-Newtonian accurate eccentric orbits while restricting the initial-eccentricity contributions to its leading order. Specifically, our frequency domain approximant consistently incorporates the orbital, advance of periastron, and gravitational-wave emission effects fully up to the 3PN order. We pursue detailed parameter estimation studies of GW170817 and GW190425 using TaylorF2Ecck, after performing comprehensive sanity checks to validate the model's performance and investigate the influence of periastron advance in the relevant parameter space. The results indicate that initial-eccentricity at 20 Hz is essentially zero (less than 0.011 for GW170817 and less than 0.028 for GW190425) at a 90 percent confidence level. We compare posteriors for these two events that arise from a few purely inspiral eccentric approximants and point out certain subtle effects arising due to the inclusion of periastron advance. Additionally, these detailed studies reveal the importance of incorporating initial eccentricity contributions at least up to 3.5PN-order and discuss its implications. We substantiate this inference by employing versions of quasi-circular TaylorF2 approximant that incorporate Fourier phase contributions beyond the conventional 3.5PN order.

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction of quantum detector models with fields in curved spacetimes provides fundamental insights into phenomena such as Hawking and Unruh radiation. While standard models typically assume a minimal coupling between the detector and the field, physically motivated derivative couplings, which are sensitive to field gradients, have been less explored, particularly in the context of modified gravity theories. In this paper, we develop a general framework to analyze the acceleration radiation from a two-level atomic detector with a derivative coupling undergoing a radial geodesic infall into a generic static, spherically symmetric black hole. We derive a general integral expression for the excitation probability and apply it to two distinct spacetimes. For an extended uncertainty principle (EUP) black hole, we demonstrate that the detector radiates with a perfect thermal spectrum at the precise Hawking temperature, reinforcing the universality of this phenomenon. For a black hole solution in a Ricci-coupled Bumblebee gravity model, the radiation is also thermal. Still, its temperature is modified in direct correspondence with the theory's Lorentz-violating parameters, consistent with the modified Hawking temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that derivative coupling results in a significantly enhanced entropy flux compared to minimal coupling models. Our results establish acceleration radiation as a sensitive probe of near-horizon physics and demonstrate that this phenomenon can provide distinct observational signatures to test General Relativity (GR) and alternative theories of gravity in the strong-field regime.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop the spacetime approach to gravitational lensing by spherically symmetric perturbations of flat, cosmological constant-dominated Friedman-Robertson-Walker metrics. The geodesics of the spacetime are expressed as integral expressions which are used to examine the formation of multiple images and the observed shapes of non-point sources. We develop the lens mapping from the spacetime perspective, and use the Jacobian of the mapping to explain the observed image shapes. Approaching the geodesic equations as ordinary differential equations, we demonstrate the development of wave front singularities and time delays between light ray signals. This work demonstrates that the widely used thin lens approximation can be replaced with more robust techniques aligned with general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 Power spectral density (PSD) estimation is a critical step in gravitational wave (GW) detectors data analysis. The Welch method is a typical non-parametric spectral estimation approach that estimates the PSD of stationary noise by averaging periodograms of several time segments, or by taking the median of periodograms to adapt to non-stationary noise. In this work, we propose a wavelet-based approach for fast PSD estimation of both stationary and non-stationary noise. For stationary noise, we apply wavelet smoothing to the periodogram, avoiding the segmentation step in the Welch method, and enabling PSD estimates with high frequency resolution and low variance. The wavelet smoothing PSD outperforms Welch PSD in matched filtering and parameter estimation. For non-stationary noise, we estimate the PSD by taking the median of wavelet packet coefficients in each frequency bin, which offers greater robustness than the traditional median periodogram method. This work introduces a new PSD estimation approach for GW data analysis and expands the application of wavelet methods in this field.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the polarization characteristics of solitonic boson stars surrounded by a thin accretion disk. By comparing their polarization images with corresponding optical images, we find a positive correlation between the polarization intensity distribution in the polarization images and the brightness in the optical images. Consequently, the strongest polarization occurs at the location corresponding to the direct image. The influence of the coupling strength of the sixtic potential on the polarization intensity distribution is not monotonic, under strong coupling, the polarization will concentrated on the left side of the image as the coupling strength increases, whereas under weak coupling, it is more evenly distributed across the entire direct image as the coupling strength increases. Moreover, we find that as the initial scalar field increases, both the lensing image and photon ring become more prominent. However, the polarization intensity at these regions remains weak. Due to the absence of the event horizon in solitonic boson stars, the polarization vector can penetrate the stellar interior, unlike in black holes, where no polarization signals exist within the event horizon. Our numerical simulations clearly reveal this phenomenon, suggesting that polarization features may serve as an effective tool for distinguishing solitonic boson stars from black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We study images of spacetimes containing continuous photon spheres (CPS). For a self-gravitating, isotropic, spherically symmetric spacetime with CPS, we find that a thin accretion disk produces images that closely resemble those of a Schwarzschild black hole, despite significant differences in photon dynamics. More generally, for any static, pherically symmetric spacetime with a luminous CPS core, the image profile is universal: members of this class produce identical image shapes, differing only by an overall normalization factor. This universality is, however, sensitive to the nature of the accretion flow and breaks down for spherically symmetric infalling accretion, where Doppler shifts and non-static emission introduce image features that depend on the flow dynamics and the metric. Finally, we investigate photon regions in a rotating CPS spacetime and find that unlike in Kerr spacetime, the photon region appears as one or two angular sectors in a constant-$\phi$ cross section. These distinctive photon region properties could produce observable signatures that distinguish rotating CPS spacetimes from the Kerr one.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in post-Minkowskian (PM) gravity provide new avenues for the high precision modelling of compact binaries. In conjunction with the Effective One Body (EOB) formalism, highly accurate PM informed models of binary black holes on scattering trajectories have emerged. Several complementary approaches currently exist, in particular the SEOB-PM model, the $w_{\rm eob}$ framework and the recent LEOB approach. These models incorporate PM results in fundamentally different ways, employing distinct resummation schemes and gauge choices. Notably, both SEOB-PM and LEOB have been used to compute gravitational waves of bound systems, showing excellent agreement with numerical relativity (NR). The essential component to all of the models is the EOB mass-shell condition describing the dynamics of the two-body spacetime. In this work we will investigate how this mass-shell condition is constructed, paying particular attention to the impact of gauge choices and how they interact with different resummation schemes, showing that there is a strong dependence on both coordinate choice and EOB gauge. For the region of parameter space considered, we find that the best performing gauges coincide with the choices made in SEOB-PM and $w_{eob}$, with other choices exhibiting worse performance. The case of spinning black holes is also considered, where the current techniques for spinning EOB-PM are reviewed and compared. We also introduce a new gauge based upon the centrifugal radius, which improves upon previous models, particularly for large and negative spins. This offers a promising avenue for further resummation of spin information within the EOB-PM framework.

 - **Abstract**
 The theory of General Relativity has successfully passed a large number of observational tests. The theory has been extensively tested in the weak-field regime with experiments in the Solar System and observations of binary pulsars. The past 10 years have seen significant advancements in the study of the strong-field regime, which can now be tested with gravitational waves, X-ray data, and black hole imaging. Here I summarize the state-of-the-art of the tests of General Relativity with black hole X-ray data and I briefly discuss the long-term vision of the possibility of an interstellar mission to the closest black hole for more precise and accurate tests.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we explore the thermodynamic properties of a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) embedded in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) background, which is further coupled with a cloud of strings and surrounded by a quintessence-like fluid. Beginning with the formulation of BH mass in terms of the event horizon radius, we incorporate the concept of pressure as related to the AdS curvature radius within the framework of extended phase space thermodynamics. Using this setup, we derive key thermodynamic quantities, including the Gibbs free energy and internal energy, to characterize the energetic behavior of the black hole system. To assess the stability of the black hole, we compute the specific heat capacity and analyze how it is influenced by external parameters, such as the string cloud and the quintessence-like fluid. These geometric and matter fields are shown to significantly modify the thermal response of the BH. Furthermore, we examine the inversion temperature associated with the black hole and highlight its distinction from the standard Hawking temperature, providing deeper insight into the phase structure. Additionally, we investigate the Joule-Thomson expansion process and demonstrate how the aforementioned parameters affect this thermodynamic phenomenon, showing important aspects of BH cooling and heating behavior in an extended thermodynamic context.

 - **Abstract**
 This article presents a comprehensive and rigorous overview of spacetime singularities within the framework of classical General Relativity. Singularities are defined through the failure of geodesic completeness, reflecting the limits of predictability in spacetime evolution. The paper reviews the mathematical structures involved, including differentiability classes of the metric, and explores key constructions such as Geroch's and Schmidt's formulations of singular boundaries. A detailed classification of singularities - quasi-regular, non-scalar, and scalar - is proposed, based on the behavior of curvature tensors along incomplete curves. The limitations of previous approaches, including the cosmic censorship conjecture and extensions beyond General Relativity, are critically examined. The work also surveys the major singularity theorems of Penrose and Hawking, emphasizing their implications for gravitational collapse and cosmology. By focusing exclusively on the classical regime, the article lays a solid foundation for the systematic study of singular structures in relativistic spacetimes.

 - **Abstract**
 Mass inflation is a phenomenon happened in the vicinity of inner horizon in two-horizon spacetime. It is shown that the mass of initially small perturbations will grow exponentially as they approach the inner horizon. This implies that black hole inner horizon is unstable to the perturbations. In view of the fact that the mass inflation is determined by the surface gravity of inner horizon, Carballo-Rubio et al. showed that if one makes the surface gravity of inner horizon vanish, then the exponential growth character of mass inflation is not present. Basing on this conclusion, we look for the black hole solutions of multiple horizons with nonlinear Maxwell field. Then we make the inner horizons to coincide with each other such that the surface gravities of every inner horizon vanish. By this way, black holes of multiple horizons without mass inflation are constructed.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the electric Penrose process in ABG(-dS) regular black holes, examining the influence of the black hole charge and the cosmological constant on the negative-energy region and energy extraction efficiency. Compared with RN(-dS) black holes, ABG(-dS) black holes have a larger negative-energy region, which allows this process to occur farther from the horizons, and higher energy extraction efficiency. This is especially true when the splitting point is close to the event horizon, and the difference widens as the black hole charge increases. Even when the black hole charge and cosmological constant take very small values relevant to astrophysics, significant differences still exist, with the maximum efficiency ratio being approximately 23/8. This indicates that in real astrophysical scenarios, ABG(-dS) black holes can accelerate charged particles more efficiently and exhibit superior energy extraction capabilities compared with RN(-dS) black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 In the work [Phys.Rev.D 105 (2022) 2, 024042], D'Ambrosio et al. investigated spherically symmetric black hole solutions in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, where several solutions satisfy the condition: $g_{tt}g_{rr} = \mathrm{const}$. This condition is characteristic of many black holes, including the Schwarzschild spacetime. In this Comment, we argue that no nontrivial vacuum black hole solutions satisfy this condition in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity. We demonstrate our claim by reexamining the field equations under the "Set 2" connection called by D'Ambrosio et al., which is necessary for obtaining solutions distinct from those of general relativity (GR). For the case where the free parameters $c$ and $k$ are zero, i.e., Option 2 in their work, we show that any attempt to find a solution beyond GR forces the non-metricity scalar to vanish ($\mathbb{Q}=0$), which trivializes the field equations and does not describe a valid black hole solution. Our findings indicate that the condition, $g_{tt}g_{rr} = \mathrm{const.}$, is overly restrictive for finding new, static and spherically symmetric vacuum black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity. This conclusion does not depend on the specific form of $f(\mathbb{Q})$. We also briefly discuss Option 1 that was not addressed in D'Ambrosio et al.'s work, and give new constraints for the selection of parameters $c$ and $k$.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors for the five-dimensional Schwarzschild--Tangherlini black hole. The quasinormal modes of gravitational perturbations are computed numerically using the continued fraction method. Particularly, we analyze the scalar, vector, and tensor types of perturbations, noting that the tensor type only exists in spacetimes with more than four dimensions. The grey-body factors are then calculated analytically via the correspondence, using data from the fundamental quasinormal mode and the first overtone. We then compute the grey-body factors independently using a numerical method and find that the results from the two methods coincide. This demonstrates that the correspondence holds with high accuracy for all three types of gravitational perturbations. Furthermore, our results extend the validity of the correspondence to the tensor type, which can only be tested in spacetimes with more than four dimensions.

#### Primary hairs may create echoes

 - **Abstract**
 In most scenarios studied so far, the appearance of echoes in the ringdown signal requires modifications external to the black hole itself, such as the presence of matter in the near-horizon region, quantum field clouds, or exotic compact objects like wormholes that effectively introduce additional peaks in the effective potential. In this work we show that echoes can naturally arise in a different setting: black holes endowed with primary Proca-Gauss-Bonnet hair. We demonstrate that the primary hair modifies the effective potential in such a way that a second peak is formed, giving rise to late-time echoes without invoking any external environment or exotic horizon-scale physics. Using both the higher-order WKB method with Padé resummation and time-domain integration, we compute the quasinormal spectrum for scalar and Dirac test fields and show the appearance of these echoes. Our results highlight a novel mechanism by which primary hairs alone can leave observable imprints on the ringdown signal of black holes in modified gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 A connection between the completion of quantum mechanics featuring events and the theory of emergent spacetime in quantum gravity where von Neumann algebra plays a vital role is established. In thermal equilibrium, we show that the Principle of Diminishing Potentialities (PDP) holds for the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with gauge group $SU(N)$ when the temperature is higher than Hawking-Page temperature. Below Hawking-Page transition and for the case of zero temperature, PDP does not hold. Since the centralizer of thermofield double state on the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory coincides with the center of the large $N$ algebra which is trivial, we extend the large $N$ algebra by performing crossed product by the maximal abelian subgroup $H $ of the compact symmetry group $G$ of the two-sided eternal black hole. In this case, the centralizer of thermofield double state is non-trivial and it is given by the action of the maximal abelian subgroup $H$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$. This centralizer is by itself commutative and it coincides with its own center. This implies that the first actual event that initiate the ``Events-Trees-Histories'' dynamical evolution in this framework is given by the spectral projectors associated to the action of the Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ associated to the group $G$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the holographic description for general stress-energy tensor deformations in arbitrary dimensions using the metric flow approach. Mixed boundary conditions corresponding to these deformations emerge from solutions to the metric flow equations. To test this proposal, we analyze planar AdS black holes with such boundary conditions and find that the deformed energies satisfy flow equations consistent with the field theory interpretation. We further derive the commuting condition for stress-energy tensor deformations and extend the mixed boundary condition description to accommodate families of commuting deformations.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by string theory activities, we investigate the swampland program in the black hole context via CUDA numerical computations. Precisely, we study charged black hole solutions submerged in a hypergeometric inflationary potential extracted from Gauss-Bonnet scalar couplings to the Einstein-Maxwell-Hilbert action. Exploiting CUDA enabled parallel programming techniques, we examine the scalar potential behaviors permitting to derive the physically relevant roots of the black hole metric function. Equipped with more powerful CUDA techniques, we explore the effects of the parametric quantities on such roots supporting a swampland investigation. Accordingly, we establish a relationship between the charge $Q$ and the mass $M$ of a charged black hole allowing to approach the extremal limit and the cosmic horizon behaviors. Furthermore, we highlight the implications of the scalar field related to swampland conjectures including the moduli distance. Employing certain developed CUDA techniques to extract criticality conditions via black hole thermodynamics, we establish a relationship between the scalar moduli and the charge $Q$, enabling to show at what stage black holes can become unstable disintegrating into light states associated with the ratio $\frac{Q}{M}>2\sqrt{\pi}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the asymptotic symmetries of the Nappi-Witten spacetime in four dimensions, a plane wave arising as the Penrose limit of AdS$_2\times S^2$. Imposing suitable boundary conditions at large transverse distance, we uncover a new infinite-dimensional symmetry algebra allowing for non-trivial central extensions. The corresponding phase space encompasses the most general four-dimensional pp-wave metric, including in particular the Penrose limit of Kerr black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been shown that the non-Abelian vortex string in 4D $\mathcal{N}=2$ SQCD with the U(2) gauge group and $N_f=4$ flavors becomes a critical superstring. Its 10D target space is a product of the flat 4D space and an internal noncompact Calabi-Yau threefold, namely, the conifold. It was also shown that the Coulomb branch of the associated string sigma model, which opens up at strong coupling, can be described by $\mathcal{N}=2$ Liouville theory. We continue here the study of the recently proposed mass deformation of the U(2) theory with $N_f=4$, interpolating to SQCD with the U(4) gauge group and $N_f=8$ quarks, by analyzing the mass-deformed $\mathcal{N}=2$ Liouville theory on the string world sheet, and show that it is always described by the trumpet geometry of the target space, which is $T$-dual to the 2D $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric black hole. We use this correspondence to find the low-lying hadron spectrum in the deformed SQCD, and explain the expected increase in the number of hadronic states in the theory with more gauge fields and quarks by considering the near-Hagedorn behavior of the 2D black hole.
