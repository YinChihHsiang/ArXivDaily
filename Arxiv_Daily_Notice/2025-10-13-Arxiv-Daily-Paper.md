 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) formed in galaxy mergers are promising multi-messenger sources. They can be identified as quasars with periodic variability in electromagnetic (EM) time-domain surveys. The most massive of those systems can be detected by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) in the nanohertz frequency gravitational-wave (GW) band. We present a method to simultaneously analyze EM lightcurves and PTA observations as a multi-messenger data stream. For this, we employ a joint likelihood analysis, in which the likelihood of the EM data and the PTA likelihood are multiplied. We test this approach by simulating 208 binary signals that can be detected both by the Rubin Observatory in the nominal ten-year survey and by a PTA dataset with a ~30-year baseline, which resembles our expectations for a dataset of the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) collaboration in ~2035. We compare our multi-messenger analysis with analyses that take into account the EM and PTA data separately. We find that the joint likelihood approach results in improved parameter estimation with smaller percent errors compared to the distinct analyses that consider only EM or PTA data separately. Among the SMBHB parameters, the binary total mass and the orbital inclination show the greatest improvement. We also compare our multi-messenger pipeline with an analysis, in which the EM constraints are used as priors to the PTA analysis. We demonstrate that the joint likelihood approach delivers tighter constraints on all binary parameters, with systematically higher values of Kullback-Leibler divergence, which measures the deviation of the posterior distribution from the prior.

 - **Abstract**
 The number of observed gravitational wave (GW) events is growing fast thanks to rapidly improving detector sensitivities. GWs from compact binary coalescences like Black Holes or Neutron Stars behave like standard sirens and can be used as cosmological probes. To this aim, generally, the observation of an electromagnetic counterpart and the measurement of the redshift are needed. However, even when those are not available, it is still possible to exploit these "dark sirens" via statistical methods. In this work, we explore a method that exploits the information contained in the cross-correlation of samples of GW events with matter over-density tracers like galaxy catalogues. Contrary to other currently employed dark-sirens methods, this approach does not suffer from systematic errors related to the incompleteness of the galaxy catalogue. To further enhance the technique, we implement tomography in redshift space for the galaxy catalogue and luminosity distance space for the GWs. We simulate future data collected by the array of currently existing detectors, namely LIGO, Virgo, and Kagra, as well as planned third-generation ones such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorers. We cross-correlate these data with those from upcoming photometric galaxy surveys such as Euclid. We perform a sensitivity forecast employing a full-likelihood approach and explore the parameter space with Monte Carlo Markov Chains. We find that with this method, third-generation detectors will be able to determine the Hubble constant $H_0$ with an error of only 0.7%, which is enough to provide decisive information to shed light on the Hubble tension. Furthermore, for the other cosmological parameters, we find that the GWs and galaxy surveys information are highly complementary, and the use of both significantly improves the ability to constrain the underlying cosmology.

#### Event Horizon Telescope Pattern Speeds in the Visibility Domain

 - **Abstract**
 The Event Horizon Telescope is preparing to produce time sequences of black hole images, or movies. In anticipation, we developed an autocorrelation technique to measure apparent rotational motion using the image-domain pattern speed $\Omega_p$. Here, we extend this technique to the visibility domain and introduce the visibility amplitude pattern speed $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$. We show that in the Illinois v3 library of EHT source models, $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ depends on the source inclination, black hole mass, black hole spin, accretion state (MAD or SANE), and baseline length, and then provide approximate fits for this dependence. We show that $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ is particularly sensitive to baseline length for MAD (strongly magnetized) models, and that the slope of this dependence can be used to constrain black hole spin. As with $\Omega_p$, models predict that $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ is well below the Keplerian frequency in the emission region for all model parameters. This is consistent with the idea that $\Omega_{\mathrm{VA}}$ measures an angular phase speed for waves propagating through the emission region. Finally, we identify the information that would be provided by space-based millimeter VLBI such as the proposed BHEX mission.

 - **Abstract**
 The changing-look active galactic nucleus (CL-AGN), an extraordinary subpopulation of supermassive black holes, has attracted growing attention for understanding its nature. We present an analysis of the spectral properties of 203 low-redshift CL-AGNs ($z<0.35$) using two-epoch spectra from SDSS DR16 and DESI DR1 with time baseline ranging from $\sim$1000 to 8000 days, based on spectral fitting and decomposition. The sample consists of 11.3\% Type 1.0, 26.6\% Type 1.2, 43.1\% Type 1.5, and 19\% Type 1.8/2.0 AGNs. The total sample is divided into two datasets: Dataset A (110 objects) with minor spectral type variations, likely general AGN variability, and Dataset B (93 objects) showing significant type transitions and characteristic turn-on or turn-off behavior. Our results reveal clear optical continuum and emission-line variability, showing both bluer-when-brighter and redder-when-brighter trends. A strong correlation between the broad H$\beta$/[O~{\sc iii}] ratio and broad H$\alpha$ luminosity ($L_{\rm H\alpha}$), ${\rm log(H\beta/[O~III])}=(0.63\pm 0.07){\rm log}(L_{\rm H\alpha})-(26.49\pm2.96)\pm0.48$ for Dataset B, as well as the correlation between H$\beta$/[O~{\sc iii}] and Eddington ratio ($L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}$), ${\rm log(H\beta/[O~III])}=(0.59\pm 0.08){\rm log}(L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd})+(1.02\pm0.15)\pm0.53$ for Dataset B, suggests that accretion rate variations drive changes in ionizing flux within the broad-line region, thereby triggering AGN type transitions. These findings underscore the critical role of supermassive black hole accretion processes in refining the AGN unification model. Future work should investigate potential connections between stellar evolution in outer accretion disk and the observed scatter in these correlations.

#### Constraints on the interacting holographic dark energy models: implications from background and perturbations data

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we employ a two-step method to analyze models of holographic dark energy (HDE) and interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE), incorporating three distinct dark energy (DE)-dark matter (DM) interaction terms. First, using the latest background dataset, we conduct a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain the free parameters of the models. Then, we assess the models against each other using the key background parameters and compare them to the $\Lambda$CDM standard model. Our results show that at high redshifts, the equation of state (EoS) parameter related to the models for both homogeneous and clustered DE cases falls within the quintessence region. However, as we approach the present time, all models except HDE transition into the phantom region, and two models cross the phantom line earlier than others. In the next step, we focus on the evolution of perturbations in DE and DM. Using background and growth rate data, we constrain parameters including $\sigma_8$. We then investigate the evolution of the growth rate of matter perturbations, $f\sigma_8(z)$, and its deviation, $\Delta f \sigma_8$, from the $\Lambda$CDM model. The HDE model shows the best agreement with observational data, while other models predict varying growth rates compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we demonstrate through Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC) analysis that the compatibility of models with observational data depends on the type of data used, the DE-DM interaction term, and the assumptions regarding DE homogeneity and clustering. Our results suggest that homogeneous DE models yield more agreement with observational data than clustered DE models.

#### A Sharper View of the X-ray Spectrum of MCG--6-30-15 with XRISM, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR

 - **Abstract**
 We present a time-averaged spectral analysis of the 2024 XRISM observation of the narrow-line Seyfert-1 galaxy MCG--6-30-15, taken contemporaneously with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. Our analysis leverages a unique combination of broadband and high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy to definitively isolate and characterize both broad and narrow emission and absorption features in this source. The best-fitting model for the joint spectral analysis is very well described by reflection from the inner accretion disk illuminated by a compact corona, modified by multi-zone ionized absorption from an outflowing wind along the line of sight. The XRISM/Resolve data confirm that a strong, relativistically-broadened Fe K$\alpha$ emission line is required in order to obtain an adequate model fit. The Resolve data additionally verify the presence of a $v_{\rm out} \sim 2300$ km/s component of this outflowing wind, find tentative evidence for a $v_{\rm out} \sim 20,000$ km/s wind component, and indicate that the reflection from distant, neutral material may originate in a non-uniform structure rather than the traditional torus of AGN unification schemes. Though a rapid prograde black hole spin is statistically preferred by the best-fitting model, consistent with previous results, the AGN flux variability over the course of the observation complicates the interpretation of the time-averaged spectra. This insight, clarified by the combination of high signal-to-noise and high spectral resolution in the joint dataset, emphasizes the importance of time-resolved, high-resolution spectral analysis in unambiguously measuring the physical properties of variable AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 During cosmic noon ($z\sim1-3$), when both star formation and black hole growth peaked, galaxy mergers are predicted to trigger dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) that eventually coalesce as supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. However, observations of dual quasars with sub-5 kpc separations-the critical phase preceding final coalescence-have remained elusive due to angular resolution limitations. We present the discovery and confirmation of two sub-arcsecond dual quasars at $z>1$, selected from 59,025 SDSS quasars, which fall within the footprint of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey. Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and slitless spectroscopy, we confirmed SDSS J1625+4309 ($z=1.647$, separation 0.55"/4.7 kpc) and SDSS J0229$-$0514 ($z=3.174$, separation 0.42"/3.2 kpc), probing the sub-5 kpc separation regime. Through novel combination of WFC3/IR direct imaging (F140W) and grism spectroscopy (G141), we resolve both components morphologically and spectroscopically confirm their dual nature via detection of H$\beta$+[OIII] and MgII emission lines in each nucleus. Two-dimensional image decomposition reveals distinct host galaxy morphologies: J1625+4309 shows an extended, disturbed structure ($R_e$=4.7 kpc) indicative of an ongoing major merger, while J0229$-$0514 exhibits a compact host ($R_e$=1.4 kpc) suggesting an advanced coalescence stage. Black hole mass estimates based on virial relations yield M$_{\mathrm{BH}} \sim 10^{8.1}-10^{8.7} M_\odot$ with line-of-sight velocity offsets of $(0.7\pm0.1)\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$ and $(1.0\pm0.2)\times10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. These confirmations directly constrain the frequency and properties of close dual quasars, opening new avenues for studying SMBH mergers at cosmic noon.

#### Investigating the $w$CDM Model with Latest DESI BAO Observations

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we explore the impact of various combinations of CMB-independent datasets, including the recent DESI BAO measurements, on the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy and other cosmological parameters within the framework of the dynamical dark energy model ($w$CDM). Assuming a constant EoS parameter for dark energy, we derive constraints on the free parameters of the model using observational datasets such as DESI BAO, BBN, Observational Hubble Data (OHD), and Pantheon Plus (SN$^+$) $\&$ SH0ES. Our analysis examines the deviations of the $w$CDM model from the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario and assesses its implications for cosmological tensions, particularly the $H_0$ tension [$\text{km} \text{s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$]. We find that the combination of DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ (DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ \&SH0ES) datasets provides constraints on $w_{\mathrm{de}0}$, suggesting a possible deviation from the cosmological constant scenario at a significance level of $1.6\sigma$ ($1.4\sigma$), respectively. Furthermore, we observe an inverse correlation between $w_{\text{de0}}$ and $H_0$, which highlights the role of dark energy dynamics in resolving the tension $H_0$ by approximately $2.1\sigma(0.8\sigma)$ from DESI BAO + BBN + OHD (DESI BAO + BBN + OHD + SN$^+$ \&SH0ES) datasets, respectively. Our findings offer valuable insights into the nature of dark energy and its influence on the cosmic expansion history, with implications for future observational efforts. We utilize the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to evaluate our model's performance. The results indicate that the $w$CDM model demonstrates superior effectiveness.

 - **Abstract**
 As the statistical precision of cosmological measurements increases, the accuracy of the theoretical description of these measurements needs to increase correspondingly in order to infer the underlying cosmology that governs the Universe. To this end, we have created the Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid (CLOE), which is a novel cosmological parameter inference pipeline developed within the Euclid Consortium to translate measurements and covariances into cosmological parameter constraints. In this first in a series of six papers, we describe the theoretical recipe of this code for the Euclid primary probes. These probes are composed of the photometric 3x2pt observables of cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and galaxy clustering, along with spectroscopic galaxy clustering. We provide this description in both Fourier and configuration space for standard and extended summary statistics, including the wide range of systematic uncertainties that affect them. This includes systematic uncertainties such as intrinsic galaxy alignments, baryonic feedback, photometric and spectroscopic redshift uncertainties, shear calibration uncertainties, sample impurities, photometric and spectroscopic galaxy biases, as well as magnification bias. The theoretical descriptions are further able to accommodate both Gaussian and non-Gaussian likelihoods and extended cosmologies with non-zero curvature, massive neutrinos, evolving dark energy, and simple forms of modified gravity. These theoretical descriptions that underpin CLOE will form a crucial component in revealing the true nature of the Universe with next-generation cosmological surveys such as Euclid.

 - **Abstract**
 Euclid is expected to establish new state-of-the-art constraints on extensions beyond the standard LCDM cosmological model by measuring the positions and shapes of billions of galaxies. Specifically, its goal is to shed light on the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Achieving this requires developing and validating advanced statistical tools and theoretical prediction software capable of testing extensions of the LCDM model. In this work, we describe how the Euclid likelihood pipeline, Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid (CLOE), has been extended to accommodate alternative cosmological models and to refine the theoretical modelling of Euclid primary probes. In particular, we detail modifications made to CLOE to incorporate the magnification bias term into the spectroscopic two-point correlation function of galaxy clustering. Additionally, we explain the adaptations made to CLOE's implementation of Euclid primary photometric probes to account for massive neutrinos and modified gravity extensions. Finally, we present the validation of these CLOE modifications through dedicated forecasts on synthetic Euclid-like data by sampling the full posterior distribution and comparing with the results of previous literature. In conclusion, we have identified in this work several functionalities with regards to beyond-LCDM modelling that could be further improved within CLOE, and outline potential research directions to enhance pipeline efficiency and flexibility through novel inference and machine learning techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 The Euclid mission aims to measure the positions, shapes, and redshifts of over a billion galaxies to provide unprecedented constraints on the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Achieving this goal requires a continuous reassessment of the mission's scientific performance, particularly in terms of its ability to constrain cosmological parameters, as our understanding of how to model large-scale structure observables improves. In this study, we present the first scientific forecasts using CLOE (Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in Euclid), a dedicated Euclid cosmological pipeline developed to support this endeavour. Using advanced Bayesian inference techniques applied to synthetic Euclid-like data, we sample the posterior distribution of cosmological and nuisance parameters across a variety of cosmological models and Euclid primary probes: cosmic shear, angular photometric galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and spectroscopic galaxy clustering. We validate the capability of CLOE to produce reliable cosmological forecasts, showcasing Euclid's potential to achieve a figure of merit for the dark energy parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$ exceeding 400 when combining all primary probes. Furthermore, we illustrate the behaviour of the posterior probability distribution of the parameters of interest given different priors and scale cuts. Finally, we emphasise the importance of addressing computational challenges, proposing further exploration of innovative data science techniques to efficiently navigate the Euclid high-dimensional parameter space in upcoming cosmological data releases.

 - **Abstract**
 We study stochastic effects in viable ultra-slow-roll inflation models that produce primordial black holes. We consider asteroid, solar, and supermassive black hole seed masses. In each case, we simulate $10^8$ patches of the universe that may collapse into PBHs. In every patch, we follow $4\times10^4$ momentum shells to construct its spherically symmetric profile from first principles, without introducing a window function. We include the effects of critical collapse and the radiation era transfer function. The resulting compaction function profiles are very spiky due to stochastic kicks. This can enhance the PBH abundance by up to 36 orders of magnitude, depending on the mass range and collapse criterion. The PBH mass function shifts to higher masses and widens significantly. These changes may have a large effect on observational constraints of PBHs and make it possible to generate PBHs with a smaller amplitude of the power spectrum. However, convergence issues for the mass function remain. The results call for redoing collapse simulations to determine the collapse criterion for spiky profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent DESI BAO measurements have revealed a potential deviation from a cosmological constant, suggesting a dynamic nature of dark energy. To rigorously test this result, complementary probes such as weak gravitational lensing are crucial, demanding highly accurate and efficient predictions of the nonlinear matter power spectrum within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. However, most existing emulators fail to cover the full parameter posterior from DESI DR2+CMB constraints in the $w_0\mbox{-}w_a$ plane. In this work, we extend the spectral equivalence method outlined in Casarini et al. 2016 to use auxiliary $w_0w_a$CDM models for approximating the power spectrum of a target $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology, moving beyond the previous use of $w$CDM auxiliaries. Incorporating this enhanced module, the extended CSST Emulator achieves a prediction accuracy of $\leq1\%$ over the $1\sigma$ confidence region from DESI DR2+CMB constraints for $z\leq3$, validated by additional dynamic dark energy simulations. The emulator's applicable parameter space has been generalized to fully encompass the $2\sigma$ region, greatly enhancing its utility for cosmological analysis in the post-DESI era.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the robustness and physical implications of a set of characteristic redshifts that capture key features of the late-time Universe. Using both model-independent reconstructions as well as different dark energy (DE) parameterizations, we show that these redshifts remain stable across cosmological models and reconstruction algorithm, making them reliable geometric anchors of the expansion history. Moreover, the Alcock-Paczyński corrections at these redshift anchors are found to be unity with high statistical significance, making them natural isotropy points in the comoving distance-redshift relation. We also find that certain redshifts anchors $(z < 1)$ coincide with epochs where strong deviations from the Planck $\Lambda$CDM baseline are apparent irrespective of DE parametrisation like CPL or reconstruction algorithm, indicating their potential as probes of new physics in cosmological evolution. Finally, we demonstrate, for the first time, that a Raychaudhuri Equation Informed Reconstruction Algorithm, substantially enhances the precision of the inferred distance measures and the Hubble expansion rate as well as results tighter constraints in the DE parameter space. These results demonstrate that combining geometric reconstruction with physics-informed kinematic information offers a powerful and consistent algorithm to probe new physics in the late-time dynamics of our Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves from compact binary inspirals offer a new opportunity to constrain the cosmological time dependence of gravitational coupling parameters, due to the high precision of the observations themselves as well as the significant cosmological redshifts at which such systems exist. We calculate theory-independent equations of motion for compact objects in a binary system, implementing a new approach to sensitivities, and subsequently determine the gravitational wave signal that one should expect to measure from their inspiral. Expressions for the wave phase and amplitude are derived in terms of post-Newtonian gravitational coupling parameters, radiative flux parameters, and compact body sensitivities. These results complement recent attempts to gain theory-independent constraints on the time-evolution of gravitational coupling parameters from cosmological probes, and represent a new opportunity to constrain modified gravity with gravitational wave data.

#### Distinguishing between Black Holes and Neutron Stars within a Population of Weak Tidal Measurements

 - **Abstract**
 We study the ability of tidal signatures within the inspiral of compact binaries observed through gravitational waves (GWs) to distinguish between neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). After quantifying how hard this measurement is on a single-event basis, we investigate the ability of a large catalog of GW detections to constrain the fraction of NS in the population as a function of mass: $f_{\mathrm{NS}}(m)$. Using simulated catalogs with realistic measurement uncertainty, we find that $> O(200)$ events will be needed before we can precisely measure $f_{\mathrm{NS}}$, and catalogs of $> O(100)$ events will be needed before we can even rule out the possibility that all low-mass objects are BHs with GW data alone (i.e., without electromagnetic counterparts). Therefore, this is unlikely to occur with advanced detectors, even at design sensitivity. Nevertheless, it could be feasible with next-generation facilities like Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope.

#### Chaos of charged particles near a renormalized group improved Kerr black hole in an external magnetic field

 - **Abstract**
 In a quantum theory of gravity, a renormalization group improved Kerr metric is obtained from the Kerr metric, where the Newton gravitational constant is modified as a function of the radial distance. The motion of neutral test particles in this metric is integrable. However, the dynamics of charged test particles is nonintegrable when an external asymptotically homogeneous magnetic field exists in the vicinity of the black hole. The transition from regular dynamics to chaotic dynamics is numerically traced as one or two dynamical parameters vary. From a statistical point of view, the strength of chaos is typically enhanced as both the particle energy and the magnetic field increase, but it is weakened with increasing the particle angular momentum and the black hole spin. In particular, an increase of the quantum corrected parameter weakens the extent of chaos. This is because the running Newton gravity constant effectively weakens the central gravitational attraction and results in decreasing sensitivity to initial conditions.

#### A physically interesting singularity in general relativity

 - **Abstract**
 We explore what appears to be a very benign timelike and naked singularity of the Weyl curvature scalar. This singularity arises in an inhomogeneous generalization of the Einstein static universe. The matter energy density is everywhere finite and it vanishes at the singularity. The spacetime still enjoys causal geodesic completeness and unambiguous wave dynamics. Each singularity contributes to the Komar mass of the spacetime, and this reduces the required size of the positive cosmological constant. In an expanding universe, the effect of the singularities is to push the acceleration towards more positive values.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the structure of nontrivial maximally symmetric vacua and compact-object solutions in shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories. Focusing on Horndeski gravity, we derive consistency conditions directly from the field equations to identify the subclasses that admit Minkowski and de Sitter vacua with a nontrivial scalar field. In doing so, we obtain a filtering mechanism that operates independently of observational data. In this context, we introduce the notion of stealth vacua, where the scalar field remains active without altering the vacuum. Following this, we examine the theoretical framework of Horndeski theories that admit homogeneous geometries and we extract the implicit form of the solution pertaining to the entire family of theories. Building upon these frameworks, we construct exact solutions in beyond-Horndeski gravity by applying a linear disformal transformation to the regularized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black hole. This procedure yields solitonic spacetimes with scalar hair as well as black holes carrying primary scalar hair, demonstrating how disformal maps can qualitatively modify solution properties. We delineate the parameter space in which the transformation is well-defined and analyze the solutions. Our results provide both a principled criterion for selecting viable Horndeski models and a framework for exploring rich solution spaces in beyond-Horndeski gravity.

#### Non-closed scalar charge in 4-dimensional Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet black hole thermodynamics

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08686

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a covariant differential-form framework to define scalar charges for stationary, asymptotically flat black holes in $4$--dimensional Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a general scalar coupling function. Contracting the scalar field equation of motion with the horizon generator $k$ yields a non-closed-form scalar charge, revealing a bulk contribution encoded in a $3$--form, which measures the obstruction to its closedness. In the presence of shift-symmetry, this obstruction vanishes and the $2$--form scalar charge satisfies a Gauss law, depending solely on boundary data. Geometrically, this reproduces known topological results in the shift-symmetric limit. This framework allows us to analyze the role of the non-closed scalar charges in black hole thermodynamics through the Smarr formula for more general couplings and provide a covariant, charge-based interpretation of the spontaneous scalarization mechanism, showing how the behavior of the scalar charge and the bulk term capture the instability of scalar-free black holes and the emergence of scalar hair. Our results offer a unified geometric understanding of the role of scalar charges and the mechanism of spontaneous scalarization in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.

#### Broken Weyl Gravity: Dynamical Torsion and Generalized Proca

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08778

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a symmetry-based construction of gravity from a phase in which Weyl invariance is spontaneously broken. Using the coset formalism, the dilaton acts as a Stuckelberg field for the gauged scale symmetry, giving the Weyl gauge field a mass of order $\mathcal{O}(M_{\rm Pl})$. The resulting gauge-gravity interactions fall within the ghost-free generalized Proca framework. We further show that the Weyl field can be exchanged for a propagating vector component of torsion, providing a natural realization of dynamical vector torsion. Our construction organizes all operators systematically, clarifies the absence of Wess-Zumino terms in $d=4$, and recovers General Relativity in the infrared with controlled higher-derivative corrections.

 - **Abstract**
 This thesis applies techniques from quantum field theory in curved spacetimes to study particle creation in external fields, focusing on the Schwinger effect (i.e., the production of particle-antiparticle pairs by intense electric fields). Although experimental verification remains out of reach, theoretical analysis advances our understanding of this phenomenon and its broader implications. The work develops the theoretical framework for quantizing charged fields in nontrivial backgrounds, addressing the ambiguities in defining the quantum vacuum and extending the concept of states of low energy from cosmology to the Schwinger setting. It examines how different quantizations allow for unitary time evolution, and generalizes the quantum Vlasov equation to encompass a wider range of schemes. An operational perspective reveals that quantum ambiguities have genuine physical meaning, being linked to different modes of interaction and measurement. The study also analyzes dynamical transitions between static regimes and their impact on observables, with applications to analog cosmological expansion in Bose-Einstein condensates and the Schwinger effect itself. In the context of black holes, the thesis shows that the Schwinger effect prevents the formation of black holes from light under current conditions and investigates fermionic charge superradiance, demonstrating how quantum effects lead to black-hole discharge (a process without classical analogue). Overall, the thesis underscores the fundamental role of external electromagnetic and gravitational fields in defining particles and vacua, revealing the limits of flat-spacetime intuition and identifying purely quantum phenomena with implications for black-hole physics. It contributes to bridging the conceptual gap between general relativity and quantum field theory and offers new tools toward a consistent quantum description of spacetime.
