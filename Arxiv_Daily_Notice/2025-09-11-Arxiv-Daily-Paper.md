 - **Abstract**
 The present-day mass function of supermassive black holes is the most important observable quantity for the prediction and theoretical interpretation of the gravitational wave background (GWB) measured by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Due to the limited sample size of galaxies with dynamically inferred SMBH masses, more readily measurable galaxy properties $X$ that correlate with the black hole mass are used as labels (via scaling relations $M_{\bullet}-X$), which can then be counted in a larger galaxy catalog to produce a measurement of the mass function. Estimating the amplitude of the GWB from the local mass function is therefore simpler than general measurements of scaling relations and galaxy mass/luminosity functions for two reasons: the contribution to the characteristic strain is dominated by a narrow range of masses, and the mass proxy $X$ is always marginalized over. While consistent errors in $X$ in both catalogs are irrelevant, relatively small biases between them can produce significant shifts in the predicted SMBH abundance. In this work, we explore measurements of the SMBH mass function using different mass proxies through a set of catalogs with a number of redundant measurements between them. This enables us to investigate internal inconsistencies that lead to discrepancies in the final black hole abundance, while minimizing observational systematic biases induced by combining disparate sets of measurements. We focus on 3 proxies: the velocity dispersion $\sigma$, K-band luminosity $L$, and a combination of $L$ and radius $R$ defined by the fundamental plane. We show that all three can be reconciled to some degree, but highlight the remaining dependence on poorly-quantified systematic corrections between the scaling relation catalogs and the mass function catalogs, as well as the potential impact of selection effects.

 - **Abstract**
 Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) are at least an order of magnitude brighter than standard supernovae, with the internal power source for their luminosity still unknown. The central engines of SLSNe-I are hypothesized to be magnetars, but the majority of SLSNe-I light curves have multiple bumps or peaks that are unexplained by the standard magnetar model. Existing explanations for the bumps either modulate the central engine luminosity or invoke interactions with material in the circumstellar environment. Systematic surveys of the limited sample of SLSNe-I light curves find no compelling evidence favoring either scenario, leaving both the nature of the light-curve fluctuations and the applicability of the magnetar model unresolved. Here, we report high-cadence multiband observations of an SLSN-I with clear "chirped" (i.e., decreasing period) light-curve bumps that can be directly linked to the properties of the magnetar central engine. Our observations are consistent with a tilted, infalling accretion disk undergoing Lense-Thirring precession around a magnetar centrally located within the expanding supernova ejecta. Our model demonstrates that the overall light curve and bump frequency independently and self-consistently constrain the spin period and the magnetic field strength of the magnetar. Assuming standard accretion disk parameters, we constrain the accretion rate onto the magnetar. Our results provide the first observational evidence of the Lense-Thirring effect in the environment of a magnetar, and confirm the magnetar spin-down model as an explanation for the extreme luminosity observed in SLSNe-I. We anticipate this discovery will create avenues for testing general relativity in a new regime -- the violent centers of young supernovae.

#### Detecting Local and Integrated Relativistic Effects by Multi-Tracing a Single Galaxy Population in Harmonic Space

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring relativistic effects on cosmological scales would provide further confirmation of the validity of general relativity in the still poorly tested condition of weak gravity. Despite their relevance, relativistic imprints in the distribution of galaxies on large scales have so far eluded detection, mainly because they are stronger on the largest cosmic scales, which are plagued by cosmic variance. Expanding on previous works, we study galaxy clustering by subdividing a galaxy population into two sub-samples -- bright and faint -- and we here focus on their two-point correlation function in harmonic space, i.e. via the angular power spectrum. Thanks to such a split in magnitude and by exploiting the multi-tracer technique, we are able to boost the impact of the relativistic contributions. We first focus on the leading relativistic contribution given by the Doppler effect and show that, with a carefully tailored luminosity cut, it can be detected. Then, we look at the sub-dominant effects predicted by general relativity and quantify how their statistical significance, as yet undetectable, varies with redshift binning and survey specifications. As case studies, we consider in our forecasts a bright galaxy sample at low redshift, an H$\alpha$ emission-line galaxy survey at intermediate redshifts, and high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies at high redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 We assess the impact of the fiducial cosmology choice on cosmological inference from full-shape (FS) fits of the galaxy power spectrum in the DESI 2024 Data Release 1 (DR1). Using a suite of AbacusSummit DR1 mock catalogues based on the Planck 2018 best-fit cosmology, we quantify potential systematic shifts introduced by analysing the data under five secondary cosmologies - featuring variations in matter density, thawing dark energy, higher effective number of neutrino species, reduced clustering amplitude, and the DESI DR1 BAO best-fit $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology - relative to DESI's baseline Planck 2018 cosmology. We investigate two complementary FS analysis approaches: full-modelling (FM) and ShapeFit (SF), each with distinct sensitivities to the assumed fiducial model. Across all tracers, we find for FM that systematic shifts induced by fiducial cosmology mismatches remain well below the DESI DR1 statistical uncertainties, with maximum deviations of 0.22$\sigma_\mathrm{DR1}$ in $\Lambda$CDM scenarios and 0.12$\sigma_\mathrm{DR1+SN}$ when including SN Ia mock data in extended $w_0w_a$CDM fits. For SF, the shifts in the compressed parameters remain below $0.45\sigma_\mathrm{DR1}$ for all tracers and cosmologies.

 The Moon is our future. It may seem like a chimera with a projected cost in excess of 100 billion\$, and counting, dispensed on ARTEMIS with little to show to date. However it is the ideal site for the largest telescopes that we can dream about, at wavelengths spanning decimetric radio through optical to terahertz FIR. And it is these future telescopes that will penetrate the fundamental mysteries of the first hydrogen clouds, the first stars, the first galaxies, the first supermassive black holes, and the nearest habitable exoplanets. Nor does it stop there. Our lunar telescopes will take us back to the first months of the Universe, and even back to the first 10$^{-36}$ second after the Big Bang when inflation most likely occurred. Our lunar telescopes will provide high resolution images of exoplanets that are nearby Earth-like 'twins' and provide an unrivalled attempt to answer the ultimate cosmic question of whether we are alone in the universe. Here I will set out my vision of the case for lunar astronomy over the next several decades.

#### Short GRB 090510: a magnetized neutron star binary merger leading to a black hole

 - **Abstract**
 We model the short gamma-ray bursts (GRB) 090510 as the product of a magnetized neutron star (NS) binary merger. Accounting for the NS critical mass constraint given by the mass of PSR J0952--0607, we infer that GRB 090510 was a highly-magnetized NS-NS merger that left as remnant a Kerr black hole (BH) of $2.4 M_\odot$ with a low-mass accretion disk. The gamma-ray precursor is powered by the magnetic energy released during the merger of the NSs. The prompt emission originates at the transparency of an ultra-relativistic $e^+e^-$ pair-plasma produced by the overcritical electric field induced by the rotating strong magnetic field around the merged object before it reaches the critical mass, the GeV emission by the extractable energy of the newborn BH, and the X-ray afterglow by accretion onto it. We derive the masses of the merging NSs, their magnetic fields, the BH mass, spin, and irreducible mass, the strength of the magnetic field, the disk mass, and obtain an estimate of the gravitational-wave emission during the merger phase preceding the prompt short GRB emission. The inferred parameters agree with up-to-date numerical relativity simulations, confirming that strong magnetic fields above $10^{14}$ G develop in NS-NS mergers and that mergers leading to a central BH remnant have low-mass disks of $\sim 10^{-2} M_\odot$. We also advance the possibility that quasi-period oscillations of tens of Hz of frequency due to Lense-Thirring precession of the matter surrounding the merged object before BH formation can explain the successive spikes following the prompt emission peak.

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123 exhibits exceedingly massive components and high spins, which challenges the formation of first-generation (1G) black holes from stellar collapse and implies that this event might originate from hierarchical mergers. Here we show that the \texttt{2G+2G} merger scenario for GW231123 is favored over a \texttt{2G+1G} (or \texttt{3G+2G}) merger, with odds ratios of $>$$\mathcal{O}(10^3)$. The primary (secondary) black hole is consistent with merging binary black holes with masses of $75^{+7}_{-7}\,M_\odot$ and $66^{+4}_{-10}\,M_\odot$ ($64^{+8}_{-10}\,M_\odot$ and $59^{+7}_{-9}\,M_\odot$; 90\% credible intervals), respectively. Our results reveal that the treatment of spin priors from the population level and waveform model choice are decisive in interpreting potential hierarchical gravitational-wave signals.

#### Black hole mass function shift in proto-stellar-clusters driven by gas accretion

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed compact, massive proto-stellar clusters of low metallicity in the Cosmic Gems arc galaxy at high redshift, which represent likely precursors to globular clusters. We model the mass growth of stellar black holes (BHs) during the first few Myr of the life of a massive, compact, gaseous stellar cluster before stellar feedback expels the primordial gas. At high redshift, in a lower metallicity environment stellar winds get weaker allowing for larger gas-depletion time-scales in the cluster despite of energetic pair-instability supernova (PISN) feedback for sufficiently compact clusters. Mass segregation drives the massive stellar progenitors of BHs in the center of the cluster where gas is most dense. We estimate the conditions for which the initial black hole mass function (BHMF), with a PISN-induced cut-off $<55{\rm M}_\odot$, gets shifted to values within the upper BH mass gap, $\sim 60-130{\rm M}_\odot$, or higher, as observed by Gravitational Wave (GW) experiments LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that the BHs are shifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the mass gap, well within the range of BH components of the recent GW-signal GW231123, depending on total mass, star formation efficiency, metallicity and compactness. The individual BH mass increase follows approximately a surprisingly steep power law with respect to initial BH mass with an exponent in the range $\approx 4-6$. This occurs in gaseous proto-stellar clusters that are sufficiently massive and compact, with typical values of total mass $\sim 10^6{\rm M}_\odot$ and size $\sim 1{\rm pc}$. Our analysis suggests that proto-stellar clusters at high redshift such as Cosmic Gems arc clusters have generated through early gas accretion, BHs as heavy as $\sim 10^2-10^3{\rm M}_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high resolution mapping of the circum-nuclear regions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has revealed the existence of geometrically thin nuclear disks, in general randomly oriented with respect to their galaxy hosts. These molecular tori have typical radii of 10~pc, and contain a few 10$^7$ M$_\odot$ of H$_2$, with H$_2$ column densities between 10$^{23}$ and 10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$. We mapped two of the most massive of these molecular tori with higher resolution, in order to unveil their morphology and kinematics, their possible warp and clumpiness, and derive their stability and life-time. We used the highest resolution possible with ALMA (16~km baseline) in Band 7, taking into account for mapping CO(3-2) and HCO$^+$(4-3) the compromise between sensitivity and resolution. New features are discovered at the high resolution, obtained with a beam of 0.015\arcsec, equivalent to $\sim$ 1~pc scale, at their $\sim$ 15~Mpc distance. The molecular torus in NGC~613 appears like a ring, depleted in molecular gas near the center. The depletion region is displaced by 3~pc towards the NW from the AGN position, meaning some $m=1$ asymmetry in the torus. The molecular torus in NGC~1672 has now a different position angle from previous observations, and is edge-on, revealing a geometrically very thin torus, with a clear warp. This confirms that the classical model of a simple geometrically thick dusty torus is challenged by high resolution observations. The nuclear disks appear clumpy, and slightly lopsided. The molecular outflow in NGC~613 is now resolved out. Well inside the sphere of influence of the black holes (BH), we are now able to determine more accurately their mass, for those Seyfert spiral galaxies, in a region of the M-sigma relation where the scatter is maximum.

 - **Abstract**
 This investigation examines QPOs in two quantum-corrected BH spacetimes that preserve general covariance while incorporating quantum gravitational effects through a dimensionless parameter \zeta. We combine analytical derivations of epicyclic frequencies with comprehensive numerical simulations of BHL accretion to explore how quantum corrections manifest in observable astrophysical phenomena. Using a fiducial BH mass of M=10M_\odot representative of stellar-mass X-ray binaries, we demonstrate that the two models exhibit fundamentally different behaviors: Model-I modifies both temporal and radial metric components, leading to innermost stable circular orbit migration proportional to \zeta^4 and dramatic stagnation point evolution from 27M to 5M as quantum corrections strengthen. Model-II preserves the classical temporal component while altering only spatial geometry, maintaining constant stagnation points and stable cavity structures throughout the parameter range. Our numerical simulations reveal distinct QPO generation mechanisms, with Model-I showing systematic frequency evolution and cavity shrinkage that suppresses oscillations for \zeta \geq 3M, while Model-II maintains stable low-frequency modes up to \zeta \geq 5M. Power spectral density analyzes demonstrate characteristic frequency ratios (3:2, 2:1, 5:3) consistent with observations from X-ray binaries, providing specific targets for discriminating between quantum correction scenarios. The hydrodynamically derived constraints (\zeta \lesssim 4M) show remarkable agreement with independent EHT limits for M87* and Sgr A*, validating our theoretical framework through multiple observational channels. These results establish QPO frequency analysis as a probe for detecting quantum gravitational effects in astrophysical BHs and demonstrate the complementary nature of timing and imaging observations in constraining fundamental physics.

 - **Abstract**
 In the last decade, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) and the European Virgo observatory have opened a new observational window on the universe. These cavity-enhanced laser interferometers sense spacetime strain, generated by distant astrophysical events such as black hole mergers, to an RMS fluctuation of a few parts in $10^{21}$ over a multi-kilometer baseline. Optical advancements in laser wavefront control are key to advancing the sensitivity of current detectors and enabling a planned next-generation 40-km gravitational wave observatory in the United States, known as Cosmic Explorer. We report the first experimental demonstration of a new wavefront control technique for gravitational-wave detection, obtained from testing a full-scale prototype on a 40-kg LIGO mirror. Our results indicate that this design can meet the unique and challenging requirements of providing higher-order precision wavefront corrections at megawatt laser power levels, while introducing extremely low effective displacement noise into the interferometer. This new technology will have a direct and enabling impact on the observational science, expanding the gravitational-wave detection horizon to very early times in the universe, before the first stars formed, and enabling new tests of gravity, cosmology, and dense nuclear matter.

#### Parity Violation in Galaxy Shapes: Primordial Non-Gaussianity

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of galaxy intrinsic alignment (IA) as a probe of parity-violating primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG). Within the effective field theory (EFT) framework, we show that the parity-odd IA power spectrum is sensitive to the collapsed limit of the parity-odd primordial trispectrum. For a $U(1)$-gauge inflationary model, the IA power spectrum is proportional to the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation, $P_\zeta(k) \propto k^{-3}$. However, the proportionality constants contain not only the PNG amplitude but also undetermined EFT bias parameters. We use $N$-body simulations to determine the bias parameters for dark matter halos. Using these bias parameters, we forecast IA's constraining power, assuming data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We find that the IA power spectrum can improve the current limits on the amplitude of parity-violating PNG derived from galaxy four-point correlation and CMB trispectrum analyses. Moreover, galaxy shapes are complementary to these probes as they are sensitive to different scales and trispectrum configurations. Beyond galaxy shapes, we develop a new method to generate initial conditions for simulations and forward models from the parity-odd trispectrum with an enhanced collapsed limit.

#### Thermodynamics and P-v criticality of RN-AdS black hole surrounded by PFDM on the EGUP framework

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we systematically study the thermodynamic properties and P-v criticality of the RN-AdS black hole surrounded by PFDM in the framework of the extended generalized uncertainty principle (EGUP). In the extended phase space, starting from the first law of black hole thermodynamics, the EGUP-corrected Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and entropy are derived. Then, we use graphical methods to analyze the effects of the EGUP parameters on these thermodynamic quantities. Analysis of the heat capacity indicates that the EGUP correction is beneficial for maintaining the thermodynamic stability of black holes. Finally, based on the modified thermodynamic quantities, we obtain the EGUP-corrected black hole equation of state and Gibbs free energy. The G-T diagram with the EGUP correction effect is analyzed, and the results show that when $P<P_c$, a ``swallowtail'' behavior emerges, indicating that the black hole undergoes a first order phase transition. The position of the phase equilibrium point changes slightly as the EGUP parameters increase. For the cases of $P=P_c$ and $P>P_c$, we combine the analysis of the relationship between heat capacity and event horizon radius, finding that the phase transition characteristics depicted in the G-T diagram are similar to those without the correction effect.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate the cosmological implications of two DE models, introduced by Chen \& Jing \cite{modelhigher} and by Granda \& Oliveros \cite{gohnde}. The first model comprises three principal components: one term proportional to the Hubble parameter $ H$ squared, and two additional terms proportional to the first and second time derivatives of $ H $, respectively. The second model, known as New Holographic Dark Energy (NHDE) model, can be considered a generalization of the Ricci DE model and it contains a term proportional to the Hubble parameter $H$ squared and one to the first time derivative of $H$. We derive the analytical expressions for the reduced Hubble parameter squared $h^2$, the Equation of State (EoS) parameter of Dark Energy (DE) $\omega_D $, the pressure of DE $p_D$ and of the deceleration parameter $q $ considering both non-interacting and later on interacting DM and DE. We also consider some limiting cases for the integration constants obtained. Furthermore, we explore the limiting scenario of a flat, dark energy-dominated Universe and establish a correspondence between the proposed DE models and various scalar field frameworks. Specifically, we examine their connection with the Generalized Chaplygin Gas, the Modified Chaplygin Gas, the Modified Variable Chaplygin Gas, the Viscous Generalized Chaplygin Gas, as well as scalar field models based on Dirac-Born-Infeld theory, Yang-Mills theory and Nonlinear Electrodynamics.

 A New Taub-NUT black hole in multiple coordinate systems is solved and analyzed. This black-hole is found to be an extension of the Clifton-Barrow metric for the specific case that $\delta=-1/2$. We look at physical properties such as test particle orbits, thermodynamics, and various space-time limits. In addition, we show an Eguchi-Hanson type-II $f(R)$ solution related to the found Taub-NUT framework.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational-wave signal GW250114 was observed by the two LIGO detectors with a network matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 80. The signal was emitted by the coalescence of two black holes with near-equal masses $m_1 = 33.6^{+1.2}_{-0.8}\,M_\odot$ and $m_2 = 32.2^{+0.8}_{-1.3}\,M_\odot$, and small spins $\chi_{1,2} \leq 0.26$ (90% credibility) and negligible eccentricity $e \leq 0.03$. Post-merger data excluding the peak region are consistent with the dominant quadrupolar $(\ell = |m| = 2)$ mode of a Kerr black hole and its first overtone. We constrain the modes' frequencies to $\pm 30\%$ of the Kerr spectrum, providing a test of the remnant's Kerr nature. We also examine Hawking's area law, also known as the second law of black hole mechanics, which states that the total area of the black hole event horizons cannot decrease with time. A range of analyses that exclude up to 5 of the strongest merger cycles confirm that the remnant area is larger than the sum of the initial areas to high credibility.

 - **Abstract**
 The binary black hole signal GW250114, the loudest gravitational wave detected to date, offers a unique opportunity to test Einstein's general relativity (GR) in the high-velocity, strong-gravity regime and probe whether the remnant conforms to the Kerr metric. Upon perturbation, black holes emit a spectrum of damped sinusoids with specific, complex frequencies. Our analysis of the post-merger signal shows that at least two quasi-normal modes are required to explain the data, with the most damped remaining statistically significant for about one cycle. We probe the remnant's Kerr nature by constraining the spectroscopic pattern of the dominant quadrupolar ($\ell = m = 2$) mode and its first overtone to match the Kerr prediction to tens of percent at multiple post-peak times. The measured mode amplitudes and phases agree with a numerical-relativity simulation having parameters close to GW250114. By fitting a parameterized waveform that incorporates the full inspiral-merger-ringdown sequence, we constrain the fundamental $(\ell=m=4)$ mode to tens of percent and bound the quadrupolar frequency to within a few percent of the GR prediction. We perform a suite of tests -- spanning inspiral, merger, and ringdown -- finding constraints that are comparable to, and in some cases 2-3 times more stringent than those obtained by combining dozens of events in the fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog. These results constitute the most stringent single-event verification of GR and the Kerr nature of black holes to date, and outline the power of black-hole spectroscopy for future gravitational-wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new strategy to probe non-tensorial polarizations in the stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background. Averaging over polarization angles, we find that three-point correlations of the GW signal vanish for tensor and vector modes, while scalar modes generically leave a nonzero imprint. This property makes the GW bispectrum a distinctive and robust diagnostic of scalar polarizations predicted in theories beyond General Relativity. We derive the corresponding response functions for ground-based interferometers, pulsar timing arrays, and astrometric observables, and we construct an optimal estimator together with simple Fisher forecasts for pulsar-timing sensitivity. As a proof of principle, we show that second-order GWs sourced by primordial magnetogenesis can be characterized by large three-point functions. Our results demonstrate that GW three-point correlations provide a novel observational window on physics beyond General Relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we explore the Rényi law constraints on black hole merger in Gauß-Bonnet (GB) gravity. Specifically, we consider the case of static solutions in five-dimensional (5D) Anti-de-Sitter (AdS) spacetime and study the constraints on merger of two equal mass black holes. We calculate the general Rényi entropy expression and utilize it to study the bounds on the final black hole mass post-merger. We study its variation with the Rényi parameter. We also compare the results with those for black holes in General Relativity (GR). We find that the GB term has a significant impact on the bounds for black hole merger. The bounds for GB gravity become weaker for the zeroth order Rényi entropy and stronger for higher order Rényi entropies in comparison to GR.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the red-shift emission from special orbits (horizons replicas) where photons have the same angular velocity, in magnitude, as those of the Kerr black hole (BH) Killing horizons. We focus on two particular contexts of special significance for their observational implications. A set of these orbits is located in the BH photons shell. Therefore the analysis also connects the red-shifting or blue-shifting from replicas (defined through the BH light surfaces) to the BH shadow boundaries. We then concentrate on the equatorial, general relativistic, axially symmetric accretion disks, orbiting around the central attractor. In the analysis we adopted in particular the Polish doughnut models of geometrically thick toroids, to investigate the signals frequency-shifting from the horizons replica as related to the disks surface, inner edge and accretion flows. The findings map the red-shifting and blue-shifting regions of the signals in dependence to the photons impact parameter, view-angle, angular velocity of the emitter and BH spin. Co-rotating and counter-rotating replica could be identified through the red-shifting or blue-shifting of the emitted signals from the mapped regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The semi-review paper studies the null geodesics which appear for black hole solutions in the gravitational $4d$ model with anisotropic fluid. The equations of state for the fluid and solutions itselves depend upon integer parameter $q = 1, 2, ...$: $p_r = -\rho c^2 (2q-1)^{-1}, \quad p_t = - p_r$, where $\rho$ is the mass density, $c$ is speed of light, $p_r$ and $p_t$ are pressures in radial and transverse to radial directions, respectively. The circular null geodesics are explored and the master equation for radius $r_*$ of photon sphere is outlined as well as the proposition on existence and uniqueness of the solution to master equation obeying $r_* > r_h$, where $r_h$ is horizon radius. The relations for spectrum of quasinormal modes for a test massless scalar field in the eikonal approximation are overviewed and compared with cyclic frequencies of circular null geodesics. The shadow angles are explored.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the motion of a particle in the geometry of a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a dark matter (DM) halo with Dehnen type density profile and calculate the orbital periods along with the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Such a system emits gravitational waves (GWs), and the particle's orbit evolves under radiation reaction. We also consider the effects of dynamical friction and accretion of DM on the orbital parameters. We find that the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum decrease faster with respect to the case in which EMRI is in empty spacetime.

 - **Abstract**
 The Hawking-Penrose (1970) singularity theorem weakens the causality assumption of global hyperbolicity used in the Penrose (1965) singularity theorem, at the expense of invoking the stronger timelike (instead of null) convergence condition (TCC). We analyze the TCC for a large class of dynamical spherically symmetric spacetimes, and show that it decomposes into three independent conditions on the Misner-Sharp mass function. For stationary black holes only two of these are non-trivial. One of these conditions is already implied by the null convergence condition (NCC), whereas the other one depends explicitly on the TCC and constrains the sign of the second derivative of the mass function. We show that generic asymptotically flat regular black holes with a smooth de Sitter core locally violate this new TCC-induced condition near the core, even if they globally satisfy the other condition imposed by the NCC. Therefore, it is the violation of the TCC which ensures that regular de Sitter core black holes circumvent the Hawking-Penrose theorem. By contrast, we show that asymptotically flat regular black holes with an anti-de Sitter core locally satisfy the new TCC-induced condition near the core, but necessarily violate it at some finite distance away from it. As concrete examples for both types of spacetimes, we consider TCC violations in the Bardeen black-hole spacetime with a de Sitter core, and in a modified Bardeen black-hole spacetime with an anti-de Sitter core.

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of a remnant black hole can be probed by analyzing the gravitational waves emitted during its ringdown phase. This signal provides a direct test of general relativity in the strong-field regime. In this study, we apply a time-domain F-statistic framework to the ringdown of GW231028_153006 and find decisive evidence for the presence of the first overtone mode in the signal. The detection of the $\ell|m|n=221$ mode is statistically significant, achieving a Bayes factor of $193$ for an analysis beginning at $10\,M$ after the signal's peak amplitude--a time consistent with the linear perturbation regime. The inclusion of both the fundamental and overtone modes in our model allows for precise constraints on the remnant's properties. We infer a redshifted final mass of $243.0^{+22.7}_{-22.7}\,M_{\odot}$ and a final spin of $0.80_{-0.11}^{+0.07}$ (at $90\%$ credibility), derived from a ringdown signal with a network signal-to-noise ratio of approximately $10.5$. A test of the no-hair theorem, enabled by this two-mode detection, shows consistency with the predictions of general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 We carry out the first computation of gravitational quasinormal modes of black holes with arbitrary rotation in a theory with higher-derivative corrections. Our analysis focuses on a recently identified quartic-curvature theory that preserves the isospectrality of quasinormal modes in the eikonal limit and that is connected to string theory. We find a master equation that governs large-momentum gravitational perturbations in this theory. By solving this equation with WKB methods, we provide complete results for the corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode frequencies for arbitrary spin and arbitrary $\mu=m/(\ell+1/2)$, where $\ell$ and $m$ are the harmonic numbers. Our results show that the corrections become orders of magnitude larger when the spin is close to extremality, with the modes close to the critical value of $\mu$ that separates damped and zero-damped modes being particularly sensitive. We also perform a geometric-optics analysis of gravitational-wave propagation around black holes and relate the equatorial ``graviton-sphere'' orbits to quasinormal mode frequencies with $\ell=m$. We find that the usual correspondence between the Lyapunov exponent of those orbits and the imaginary part of the frequency is modified.

#### An Einstein ring fingerprint around SMBHs illuminated by BLR spectral lines

 - **Abstract**
 The continuum emission from the hot and ionized inner regions of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disk that is strongly lensed by the light-ring (i.e., the unstable photon orbit), is always superimposed on that of the locally emitting plasma near the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), masking strong-gravity effects and making their study difficult. A cleaner image of the light-ring against a non-luminous background, not affected by the emission and all the dynamical effects taking place near the ISCO, would thus be preferable. A more distant SMBH illumination source that could accommodate this can be provided by the unique spectral lines emitted by the cooler parts of the accretion disk, the so-called Broad Line Region (BLR). Spectral line emission from the transitional region between the inner disk and the outer BLR may be ideal for obtaining a cleaner image of the light-ring, and better suited for strong gravity tests. A crucial first order effect of a BLR spectral line illumination of the SMBHs in galactic centers, and a possible smoking gun signal of strong SMBH lensing, will be an Einstein ring, whose presence could be evident even in unresolved sources where only the total line profile can be acquired. In resolved sources, the combination of information from the image and the spectrum can even facilitate the measurement of the mass of the SMBH.

#### SMBH shadows: gravity fingerprints revealed by spectral line background radiation

 - **Abstract**
 SMBHs at the centers of galaxies, illuminated by their accretion disks, can reveal valuable information on BH spacetimes via their shadows, which can be used for strong-gravity tests. However, the continuum emission from their highly turbulent hot plasma is expected to be strongly time-varying and with very inhomogeneous brightness. This can mask important SMBH-related effects, like the appearance of the light-ring, rendering them ineffective as probes of strong gravitational lensing physics. Besides being an inhomogeneous and strongly time-varying ''illuminator'', the hot plasma emission extends all the way to the ISCO. This then leads to the superposition of the strongly-lensed radiation from the area of the light-ring to the continuum emission from the ISCO, effectively making gravitational lensing physics hard to separate from accretion disk Astrophysics. These problems could be overcome if one utilizes the spectral line radiation field emanating from the cooler parts of the extended accretion disk, the so-called BLR, and especially its expected neutral phase, as a more distant, but still adequately strong SMBH illuminator, typically found at $r\sim (10^2-10^4)\, R_s$. This kind of illumination can provide a cleaner image of the light-ring region, and thus allow more information on the spacetime geometry around the SMBH to be obtained. Here, we examine some of the benefits of such an illumination in discerning strong-gravity physics near SMBHs and their observability. We expand on the fact that such emission can provide a smoking gun signal of lensing, in the form of an Einstein ring. To first order, the imaging of the Einstein ring and its spectroscopic signature can facilitate the measurement of the SMBH mass, while the second order effects associated with the light-ring can constrain the SMBH spin, and even identify deviations from the Kerr spacetime.

#### The Effects of Near-AdS$_2$ Backreaction on Matter Fields

 - **Abstract**
 We quantify how the two-point function of a real scalar field is affected by the distortion caused by deforming AdS$_2$ to a near-AdS$_2$ background. At tree-level, the backreaction of the geometry induces a finite-temperature correction to the correlator that arises from interactions that the background generates. For a massive field, we show that this correction is not captured by JT gravity coupled to matter: it requires a backreaction of the metric field. For a massless field, the correction is controlled solely by the dilaton and hence is model-independent. We compare our findings with correlation functions on BTZ and find perfect agreement. We use our results to quantify the corrections for a class of correlators relevant to five- and four-dimensional black holes. We discuss how these corrections would enter in a holographic description of near-AdS$_2$; we also comment on how these corrections provide a universal prediction for quasinormal modes in higher dimensions.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been suggested some time ago that many black hole properties are not specific to gravity, but rather are shared by a large class of objects, the so-called saturons, that saturate the quantum field theoretic upper bound on microstate degeneracy. By now, various aspects of this universality have been understood and demonstrated in a number of explicit examples. In the present paper, we add one more brick to the building by showing that the decay of a simple two-dimensional saturated soliton copies some key aspects of the black hole decay as well as of the information retrieval. In particular, we study the evaporation process of a classically-stable vacuum bubble of a spontaneously broken $SU(N)$-symmetry, coupled to massless fermions. We show that the decay rate as well as the characteristic energy of the emitted quanta are given by the inverse size of the object, in striking similarity with the Hawking evaporation of a black hole. The time-scale of information retrieval also matches the one previously suggested for a black hole by Page. We give the semiclassical derivation of the phenomenon as well as its fully quantum resolution as a decaying coherent state of Goldstone bosons. The universal nature of the effect and its microscopic understanding support the analogous quantum portrait of a black hole as a saturated coherent state of gravitons.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work has demonstrated that coupling constants in a given action can be promoted to the role of conserved charges. This is achieved by introducing pairs of field variables constructed from combinations of scalar and gauge fields. This framework naturally suggests that the gravitational constant itself can be interpreted as a conserved charge, arising from an associated gauge symmetry. In a modified four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action, we explicitly show that the gravitational constant, in addition to the mass and the cosmological constant, emerges as a conserved charge. Our derivation, which employs the quasi-local off-shell ADT formalism, yields a result that is fully consistent with the extended thermodynamic first law and the Smarr formula.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical black hole spacetimes can be recovered from the classical limit of quantum scattering amplitudes in a low-energy effective field theory of gravity. In this work we compute, at first post-Minkowskian and dipole order, the metric and the electromagnetic potential for charged and rotating black holes in general spacetime dimensions from amplitudes describing the emission of either a graviton or a photon from a massive and charged Dirac fermion field up to one loop. In addition, we introduce a Pauli non-minimal coupling, to parametrize the black hole's gyromagnetic factor $\mathfrak{g}$. We are able to reproduce the Kerr-Newman solution in four dimensions, as well as the Chong-Cvetič-Lü-Pope solution, from five-dimensional supergravity, which includes a Chern-Simons interaction. Crucially, we show that for a charged Myers-Perry like black hole in $d+1$ spacetime dimensions, its gyromagnetic factor is equal to $\mathfrak{g}=(d-1)/(d-2)$. Hence, only in $3+1$ dimensions minimal coupling is sufficient to describe black holes from scattering amplitudes.

 - **Abstract**
 We solve the Dirac equation for a massive charged fermion in the near-extremal charged Nariai black hole with the near-horizon geometry $\mathrm{dS}_2 \times \mathrm{S}^2$. At the one-loop level, contrary to the catastrophic emission of charged spinless bosons in [C.-M. Chen \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. D 110, 085020 (2024)], we show that the emission of fermions in a narrow time-like inner region between the cosmological horizon and black hole horizon saturates the bound from the Pauli blocking and does not give an amplification (quantum superradiance). Using the reciprocal relation, we find the Schwinger emission of fermions from $\mathrm{AdS}_2 \times \mathrm{S}^2$, and compare the Schwinger emission of fermions and bosons from near-extremal Nariai black holes.
