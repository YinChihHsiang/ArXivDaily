 - **Abstract**
 Giant planets in the habitable zone may host exomoons with conditions conducive to life. In this paper we describe a method by which the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) could detect such moons: broadband reflected-light lunar eclipses (e.g., the moon passing into the shadow of the planet). We find that an Earth-like moon orbiting a Jovian-size planet at 1au can outshine its host planet near 1 micron, producing frequent (days time-scale) lunar eclipses with depths of order 50%. We determine that single eclipse events out to $\sim$12pc may be detectable for Earth-like moons around giant planets, down to $0.9R_\oplus$. Detection of smaller moons, $\sim$0.5$R_\oplus$ (corresponding to about the size of Mars or Ganymede), may be possible, but would generally require multiple events for most systems. These several-hour events provide a clear pathway to detecting habitable moons with HWO, given sufficient stare-time on each system to detect lunar eclipses. The occurrence rate of habitable exomoons remains unconstrained, however, making the ultimate yield uncertain. HWO will be capable of placing the first meaningful constraints on the frequency of habitable exomoons around giant planets; if it is non-negligible, HWO could also search for life on these worlds, possibly with lunar eclipse spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 Transient noise artifacts, or glitches, fundamentally limit the sensitivity of gravitational-wave (GW) interferometers and can mimic true astrophysical signals, particularly the short-duration intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) mergers. Current glitch classification methods, such as Gravity Spy, rely on supervised models trained from scratch using labeled datasets. These approaches suffer from a significant ``label bottleneck," requiring massive, expertly annotated datasets to achieve high accuracy and often struggling to generalize to new glitch morphologies or exotic GW signals encountered in observing runs. In this work, we present a novel cross-domain framework that treats GW strain data through the lens of audio processing. We utilize the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), a model pre-trained on large-scale audio datasets, and adapt it to the GW domain. Instead of learning time-frequency features from scratch, our method exploits the strong inductive bias inherent in pre-trained audio models, transferring learned representations of natural sound to the characterization of detector noise and GW signals, including IMBHs. We validate this approach by analyzing strain data from the third (O3) and fourth (O4) observing runs of the LIGO detectors. We used t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised clustering technique, to visualize the AST-derived embeddings of signals and glitches, revealing well-separated groups that align closely with independently validated Gravity Spy glitch classes. Our results indicate that the inductive bias from audio pre-training allows superior feature extraction compared to traditional supervised techniques, offering a robust, data-efficient pathway for discovering new, anomalous transients, and classifying complex noise artifacts in the era of next-generation detectors.

#### The TDE Population from First-Principles Models of Stellar Disruption and Debris Dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 We present a physically-grounded population model for optical tidal disruption events (TDEs) that combines first-principles hydrodynamic simulations of stellar disruption with statistical inference of the underlying stellar and black hole populations. The model's prediction of peak luminosity is based directly on recent global simulations that follow the disruption self-consistently and contains no tunable parameters related to the emission physics. We construct the predicted joint distribution of peak luminosity and black hole mass, including both full and partial disruptions, and compare it to a sample of observed TDEs using Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We find that the model reproduces the distribution in the ($M_{BH},L_{peak}$) plane for the bulk of the observed TDE population with good statistical consistency. The data strongly favor an old stellar population, with a sharp suppression of stars above $M_* \simeq 1.5 - 2 M_\odot$. They also indicate that, at fixed stellar mass, the volumetric TDE rate is nearly independent of black hole mass. Partial disruptions contribute a substantial fraction ($\sim 30\%$) of detected events in flux-limited samples and are essential for reproducing the observed distribution. The inferred population properties are robust to different approximations to the stellar mass-radius relation, although the event rate at high luminosity is sensitive to the form of this relation for massive stars. We predict a large population of difficult to detect low luminosity TDEs, implying that the true volumetric TDE rate may exceed that inferred from present samples by up to an order of magnitude.

#### Asymmetrical thermonuclear supernovae triggered by the tidal disruption of white dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 In a dense star cluster core, a tidal disruption event (TDE) of a white dwarf (WD) can occur if the WD passes within the tidal radius of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Very close encounters cause extreme tidal compression in the WD, raising temperatures enough to induce runaway fusion and produce a thermonuclear supernova (SN). Using the hydrodynamics code AREPO augmented with a 55-isotope nuclear reaction network, we performed high-resolution simulations of the TDE of a $0.6$ Msun C/O WD by a $500$ Msun IMBH for different values of the scaled impact parameter $b$ (i.e., the ratio of periapsis distance to tidal radius). Closer encounters produce combined TDE+SN events, with a partial burning of $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O into heavier isotopes -- the $^{56}$Ni fractions of the disrupted WD material vary from 1% at $b = 0.19$ to 82% at $b = 0.10$, while wider ones ($b \gtrsim 0.20$) lead to standard TDEs. In all cases, the material away from the denser regions remains unburnt, spanning a wide range of radial velocities. Such WD TDEs also exhibit a central cavity, wherein little material is found below a radial velocity of several $1000 \,\mathrm{km s}^{-1}$. We also performed 1D and 2D radiative-transfer calculations for these WD-TDEs using the codes CMFGEN and LONGPOL, respectively, covering epochs from a few days to one hundred days. We recover the typical rise times and peak luminosities of SNe Ia, but with an extremely strong viewing-angle dependence of both light curves and spectra. At nebular times, isolated strong emission lines like [Ca ii] {\lambda}{\lambda} 7291, 7323 may appear both displaced and skewed by many $1000 \,\mathrm{km s}^{-1}$ -- such extreme offsets are harder to identify at earlier times due to optical depth effects and line overlap. WD TDEs may produce a diverse set of transients with extreme asymmetry and peculiar composition.

#### A dynamical systems approach to studying the equivalence principle in dilaton gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We study a string-inspired dilaton cosmology in the Damour--Polyakov (DP) regime using dynamical-systems methods, aiming to make explicit how cosmological relaxation controls deviations from the equivalence principle. Working in the Einstein frame, we consider a spatially flat FLRW universe filled with pressureless matter and a universally coupled dilaton. Expanding the conformal coupling function and the scalar potential around the least-coupling point, we obtain a closed and self-consistent autonomous system governing the late-time evolution of the scalar-matter sector. The resulting phase space contains a stable fixed point associated with least coupling, approached only asymptotically along cosmological trajectories. Therefore, at any finite epoch the solution typically retains a small displacement from the fixed point. In the DP regime this finite-epoch displacement sets the ambient coupling, and thus determines the magnitude of fifth-force effects and deviations from the equivalence principle in the nonrelativistic limit. By linearising the system around a finite-epoch reference state, we show that the damping of the displacement is controlled by the Jacobian eigenvalues of the DP fixed point. This yields a direct dynamical estimate of how rapidly deviations from the equivalence principle are reduced during cosmological evolution. The mechanism is global and cosmological in origin, and is conceptually distinct from local environmental screening as in chameleon or symmetron scenarios. Overall, our results illustrate how phase-space techniques provide a clear bridge between cosmological dynamics and weak-field departures from General Relativity.

#### From cosmological simulations to binary black hole mergers: The impact of using analytical star formation history models on gravitational-wave source populations

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of binary black hole (BBH) mergers provide a unique window into the lives of massive stars across cosmic time. Connecting redshift-dependent merger properties to massive star progenitors requires accurate models of cosmic star formation and chemical enrichment histories. Analytical fits for the metallicity-specific cosmic star formation rate density S(Z, z) are commonly used as proxies for the complex underlying star formation history, yet they remain unconstrained. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, we evaluate the accuracy of these analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions and assess how simulation resolution and volume affect the inferred S(Z, z). By coupling the simulated and analytical S(Z, z) to the population synthesis code COMPAS, we investigate the resulting BBH merger rates and mass distributions. We find that analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions can overestimate BBH merger rates at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 6$) by up to a factor of $10$-$10^4$, depending on cosmological simulation resolution, and can introduce spurious features in the BBH mass distribution. For example, they can produce an artificial feature near $8\,M_\odot$ in the primary mass distribution at $z \lesssim 2$, which is absent when using the full simulation-based S(Z, z), while simultaneously suppressing high-mass features. These discrepancies arise because simple analytical models fail to capture a high-metallicity bump and a more flattened low-metallicity tail in the simulated S(Z, z) metallicity distribution. Our results highlight the importance of accurate star formation histories for modeling BBH populations, demonstrate the limitation of widely used analytical S(Z, z) fits, and underscore the need for careful integration of cosmological simulations, analytical fits, and population synthesis when interpreting gravitational-wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a data-driven test of the FLRW metric and the flatness of the Universe, independently of any Dark Energy model, and in light of the latest DESI DR2 results. We use Pantheon+ and DESY5 SNIa data to reconstruct the distance modulus, dimensionless comoving distance and Hubble parameter, using an iterative smoothing algorithm. Then, combining the various reconstructions with the recent BAO measurements from DESI DR2, we perform the $\mathcal{O}_k$ diagnostic, a litmus test of the FLRW metric and the flatness of the Universe. We obtain robust results that do not depend on Dark Energy models and test some of the underlying hypotheses of the concordance model. We find that when the reconstructed $\mathcal{O}_k$ diagnostic is consistent with the FLRW metric, then the median value of $\Oko$ over all reconstructions that provide an improved fit relative to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model are: ${\Omega}_{k,0}^\text{med} = 0.035 ^{+0.046}_{-0.079}\pm 0.037$ for the Pantheon+ \& DESI DR2 data combination, ${\Omega}_{k,0}^\text{med} = 0.092 ^{+0.055}_{-0.132} \pm 0.064$ for the same data but with the Pantheon+ SNIa cut at redshift $z=1.13$, which is the maximum redshift of the DES~Y5 data, and ${\Omega}_{k,0}^\text{med} = -0.119^{+0.113}_{-0.047}\pm 0.043$ for DES~Y5 \& DESI DR2. The first uncertainties correspond to the spread in $\Oko$ over all reconstructions, followed by the median 1$\sigma$ error.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic fields play a central role in black hole astrophysics, powering relativistic jets and other energetic phenomena. While near-horizon magnetic field is usually assumed to originate from the accretion flow, additional large-scale magnetic fields - such as those supplied by a companion neutron star in stellar-mass binaries or by galactic fields around supermassive black holes - may also affect the horizon-threading flux. In this work, we study the superposition of a weak arbitrarily inclined external uniform magnetic field with the internal Blandford-Znajek split-monopole field around a Schwarzschild black hole. This setup generically gives rise to magnetic null points, where the total field vanishes. We compute the magnetic flux through an arbitrarily tilted hemisphere of the event horizon and show that the flux can be substantially suppressed by the external field. In the axisymmetric case, the flux can even vanish completely. However, with nonzero inclination, complete cancellation becomes impossible, despite significant reduction. We further explore the ionization and subsequent particle acceleration from a Keplerian accretion disk, finding that efficient collimated outflows persist even under significant field inclination. We show that the acceleration is critically dependent on the external field orientation, with the escape fraction maximized at non-zero inclinations due to the destabilization of trapping zones and minimized in the anti-aligned configuration, where closed magnetic loops effectively suppress the outflow. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these findings, proposing that geometric flux cancellation can serve as a mechanism for jet quenching in compact binaries and offering an explanation for the lack of a prominent large-scale jet in Sgr A*.

#### An unexpected population of quenched galaxies harbouring under-massive SMBHs revealed by tidal disruption events

 - **Abstract**
 Restricted by event horizon suppression, tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a unique window into otherwise hidden supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the lower end of the mass spectrum, allowing the connection between star formation and SMBH mass to be explored across a broad stellar mass range. We derive stellar masses and specific star formation rates using Prospector fits to UV-MIR broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 42 TDE hosts, together with a high-mass comparison sample, and combine these with SMBH mass estimates from the literature. We first verify our approach by reproducing the established result that quenched galaxies host more massive SMBHs than star-forming systems at fixed stellar mass, a result widely interpreted as evidence for SMBH growth driving the blue-to-red sequence transition. However, examining the TDE sample in isolation reveals a trend reversal at lower masses, uncovering a surprising population of low-mass ($10^{9.6} \lesssim M_{\rm gal} \lesssim 10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$), quenched galaxies hosting SMBHs systematically less massive ($M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{6.5}$ M$_\odot$) than those in star-forming galaxies of comparable stellar mass. After ruling out degeneracies in our SED fits, we conclude that this reflects a physical difference in the quenching mechanism between these TDE hosts and the more massive galaxies. This is unlikely to be driven by AGN feedback, and could instead result from environmental processes, which can end star formation and hinder SMBH growth. We also show that the quenched and post-starburst population within the TDE sample is likely under-represented due to selection biases, suggesting the true fraction could be even higher than observed.

 - **Abstract**
 A mildly inhomogeneous universe with a cosmological constant may look like it contains evolving dark energy. We show that could be the case by modelling the inhomogeneities and their effects in three different ways: as clumped matter surrounded by voids, as back-reaction of small-scale structure on the overall expansion of the Universe, and, finally, as a large-scale curvature inhomogeneity. In all of these cases, the propagation of light is affected, and differs from that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The net result is that cosmological observables, such as angular diameter and luminosity distances, become distorted. We find, in all three models, that the inclusion of these effects pushes the distance-redshift relation towards closer agreement with recent data from both supernovae Ia from the Dark Energy Survey, and from baryon acoustic oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. The amount of inhomogeneity in these models might not be enough to explain the entirety of the deviation from a cosmological constant, but is found to be of a similar order of magnitude, hinting that these data may be consistent with a universe dominated by a cosmological constant.

#### Probabilistic Interpolation of Sagittarius A*'s Multi-Wavelength Light Curves Using Diffusion Models

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the variability of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) requires coordinated, multi-wavelength observations that span the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work, we focus on data from four key observatories: Chandra in the X-ray (2-8 keV), GRAVITY on the Very Large Telescope in the near-infrared (2.2 microns), Spitzer in the infrared (4.5 microns), and ALMA in the submillimeter (340 GHz). These multi-band observations are essential for probing the physics of accretion and emission near the black hole's event horizon, yet they suffer from irregular sampling, band-dependent noise, and substantial data gaps. These limitations complicate efforts to robustly identify flares and measure cross-band time lags, key diagnostics of the physical processes driving variability. To address this challenge, we introduce a diffusion-based generative model, for interpolating sparse, multivariate astrophysical time series. This represents the first application of score-based diffusion models to astronomical time series. We also present the first transformer-based model for light curve reconstruction that includes calibrated uncertainty estimates. The models are trained on simulated light curves constructed to match the statistical and observational characteristics of real Sgr A* data. These simulations capture correlated multi-band variability, realistic observation cadences, and wavelength-specific noise. We compare our models against a multi-output Gaussian Process. The diffusion model achieves superior accuracy and competitive calibration across both simulated and real datasets, demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for high-fidelity, uncertainty-aware reconstruction of multi-wavelength variability in Sgr A*.

 - **Abstract**
 Explicit breaking of diffeomorphism symmetry with nondynamical background fields in gravitational theories can lead to inconsistencies between the equations of motion and the underlying pseudo-Riemannian geometry. These theories produce a constraint equation that follows from the modified Einstein's equations and the contracted Bianchi identity which has no simple solution and raises questions about the consistency of backgrounds structures in extensions to general relativity. In contrast, spontaneous symmetry breaking where fields acquire a vacuum expectation value are shown to avoid these problems. Nevertheless, there are some approaches that consistently implement explicit diffeomorphism breaking by: i) introducing geometrical restrictions which may dynamically restore diffeomorphism invariance, ii) using the Stückelberg formalism where auxiliary scalar fields can carry degrees of freedom associated to spontaneously broken symmetries, and more recently by iii) exploiting the isometries of a given gravitational configuration in the presence of a background; which ultimately requires the background fields to be Lie-dragged along the Killing vectors. In this work, we further develop and apply the latter approach focusing on a concrete example involving the Gödel metric and the minimal gravitational Standard-Model Extension. We show that the resulting dynamics is fully consistent with the constraint equation and produce new Noether's identities. Furthermore we investigate causality violations by analyzing the critical radius, which is found to depend explicitly on the background fields. This dependence allows for the emergence of both causal and non-causal regions in spacetime.

#### Branch structure and nonextensive thermodynamics of Kalb-Ramond-ModMax black holes: observational signatures

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20004

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole arising in Einstein gravity coupled to a Kalb-Ramond field and ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics, both of which are independently well motivated extensions of standard electrovacuum gravity. The solution depends, beyond mass and charge, on a Lorentz-violating parameter, a ModMax deformation parameter, and a discrete branch selector $\zeta=\pm1$. We show that the ordinary branch admits extremal and non-extremal configurations, while the phantom branch generically supports a single-horizon geometry. Black-hole thermodynamics is analyzed within the Tsallis non-extensive framework, revealing branch-dependent stability and Joule-Thomson behavior. Weak gravitational lensing, photon propagation in plasma, and tidal forces are then studied, revealing clear optical and strong-field signatures that distinguish the two branches. In particular, the ordinary branch exhibits finite-radius tidal inversion, absent in the phantom sector. Our results demonstrate that the combined Kalb-Ramond and ModMax effects lead to a rich and observationally distinguishable black-hole phenomenology.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we use the generalised Klein-Gordon Equation in curved spacetime with an electromagnetic field to investigate the tunnelling phenomenon of scalar particles originating from the hot NUT Kerr Newman Kasuya Anti de Sitter (KNKNK AdS) black hole. Using the tunnelling formalism, we obtain a modified Hawking temperature different from previous works due to the quantum gravity effect for the charged Dirac particle at the HNKNK AdS black hole's horizon. We find that the modified Hawking temperature is affected by the cosmological constant, magnetic mass, electric and magnetic charges. We demonstrate that a significant number of discontinuities exist in the heat capacities of the HNKNK AdS, indicating that the black hole system becomes unstable as the black hole size decreases.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents a comprehensive stability analysis of the black hole solution within Modified General Relativity (MGR), a theory proposing a unified geometric description of dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE). A rigorous gauge-invariant formalism is employed to analyze gravitational perturbations of the extended Schwarzschild metric. The central finding is a critical pathology within the polar perturbation sector, where metric fluctuations couple to the theory's fundamental line element field. This coupling is governed by a factor that, while well-behaved at the horizon, diverges powerfully in the far-field limit as a direct consequence of the theory's non-asymptotically flat nature. This indicates a strong infrared instability that overwhelms perturbations at large distances. In stark contrast, the axial perturbation sector is found to be completely stable. This dichotomy proves that the instability is not inherent to the background metric but is specifically generated by the novel coupling mechanism encoding MGR's unified dark sectors. The results reveal a fundamental strong-coupling problem within the MGR framework, challenging its physical viability as an alternative to Einstein's General Relativity (EGR).

#### Matter around Schwarzschild black holes in scalar-tensor theories: Absorption and Scattering

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the absorption and scattering by a Schwarzschild black hole in scalar--tensor theories of gravity, where the coupling between matter and the scalar field induces different models for the effective mass of the scalar field. In model~I, a Bondi-type mass model described by the asymptotic mass $\mu_c$, horizon mass $\mu_H$, and profile slope $\lambda$, it is found that the absorption cross section increases with steeper $\lambda$, larger $\mu_c$ (especially at higher frequencies), or smaller $\mu_H$. The differential scattering cross section in this model shows the strongest dependence on the horizon mass $\mu_H$. When $\mu_H$ exceeds a critical value for a fixed incoming wave frequency $\omega$, no partial wave transmits into the black hole, flattening the differential scattering cross section as a function of angle before it increases again with further increase of $\mu_H$. Model~II, which considers a truncated accretion region outside some radius $r_0$, contains a potential well in its effective scattering potential. Its absorption cross section decreases in the low-frequency region as the accretion radius $r_0$ decreases, and more importantly, it shows resonance peaks at the quasibound wave frequencies due to resonances induced by the potential well. The differential scattering cross sections show dips around intermediate scattering angles when the parameters (mainly $\mu_H$ and $\omega$) are such that the resonantly scattered and non-resonant waves interfere destructively around these angles. In both models, absorption exhibits a zero-absorption band as $\omega$ approaches $\mu_c$ from above, and in both absorption and scattering, the effects of the parameters are found to diminish in the high-frequency limit.

#### Tidal perturbations and Love Symmetry for five-dimensional charged rotating black holes

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the tidal response of general five-dimensional (5D) black holes of STU supergravity, which include as special cases important solutions such as the Myers-Perry, BMPV, 5D Reissner-Nordström, Kerr-Newman and dyonic black holes. Solutions are parameterized by their mass, two angular momenta and up to three $U(1)$ charges. Love numbers and dissipation coefficients are obtained in the static and dynamic cases. In the latter scenario, we find new, nontrivial conditions, realized in important limiting cases of the theory, such as the BPS limit, where frequency-independent vanishing conditions are obtained. We also develop a ladder formalism for static solutions and derive the conserved charges. To the best of our knowledge, this formalism had not been previously derived for 5D black holes, including neutral ones. Finally, we show the emergence of Love symmetry in the near-zone regime, and derive the generators of the associated $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebra. It is shown that all conditions for Love-number vanishing can be explained by this algebra in terms of the highest-weight property.
