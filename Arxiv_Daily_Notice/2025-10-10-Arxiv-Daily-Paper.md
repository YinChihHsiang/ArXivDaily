 - **Abstract**
 We present the first systematic analysis of photometric redshifts (photo-z) estimated from the Rubin Observatory Data Preview 1 (DP1) data taken with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Commissioning Camera. Employing the Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL) framework, we apply eight photo-z algorithms to the DP1 photometry, using deep ugrizy coverage in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS) field and griz data in the Rubin_SV_38_7 field. In the ECDFS field, we construct a reference catalog from spectroscopic redshift (spec-z), grism redshift (grism-z), and multiband photo-z for training and validating photo-z. Performance metrics of the photo-z are evaluated using spec-zs from ECDFS and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 samples. Across the algorithms, we achieve per-galaxy photo-z scatter of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} \sim 0.03$ and outlier fractions around 10% in the 6-band data, with performance degrading at faint magnitudes and z>1.2. The overall bias and scatter of our machine-learning based photo-zs satisfy the LSST Y1 requirement. We also use our photo-z to infer the ensemble redshift distribution n(z). We study the photo-z improvement by including near-infrared photometry from the Euclid mission, and find that Euclid photometry improves photo-z at z>1.2. Our results validate the RAIL pipeline for Rubin photo-z production and demonstrate promising initial performance.

#### Stacking 21-cm Maps around Lyman-$α$ Emitters during Reionization: Prospects for a Cross-correlation Detection with the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the redshifted 21-cm line during the Epoch of Reionization will open a new window to probe the intergalactic medium during the formation of the first stars, galaxies, and black holes. A particularly promising route to an initial detection is to cross-correlate tomographic 21-cm maps with spectroscopically confirmed Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs). High-redshift LAEs preferentially reside in ionized bubbles that are strongly anticorrelated with the surrounding neutral regions traced by 21-cm observations. In this work, we study the prospect of detecting such a cross-correlation signal by stacking 21-cm image cubes around LAEs using a current-generation 21-cm instrument -- the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). Our forecast adopts a realistic mapping pipeline to generate foreground-free 21-cm image cubes. The statistical properties of these images, arising from the complex instrumental response, are carefully accounted for. We further introduce a physically motivated signal template calibrated on the THESAN radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, which connects the cross-correlation amplitude to the global neutral fraction. Our results show that a sample of ~50 spectroscopically confirmed LAEs is sufficient to begin constraining the reionization history. These results represent an important preparatory step toward joint analyses of 21-cm experiments with upcoming wide-area, high-redshift galaxy surveys from Euclid and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has identified a large population of faint, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the early universe that are powered by black holes (BHs) that often appear overmassive relative to their host galaxies. In this study, we examine the relationship between BH mass and galaxy stellar mass at $3<z<7$ using a sample of 70 broad-line AGN identified using NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy from the CEERS, JADES, and RUBIES surveys. Roughly half (43\%) of our sample appear heavily reddened and are classified as little red dots (LRDs). We estimate BH masses ($M_{\rm BH}$) using single-epoch virial techniques, while host stellar masses ($M_{\star}$) are inferred using a combination of two-dimensional surface brightness profile fitting and spectral energy distribution modeling. We find that a majority of our sources (50/70) have $M_{\rm BH}/M_{\star}$ ratios that are 1-2 dex higher than that observed in AGN locally. Using a forward-modeling Bayesian framework that accounts for uncertainties, intrinsic scatter, and selection effects, we infer a $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\star}$ relationship that is $>3\sigma$ above the relationship measured for local broad-line AGN. We derive an intrinsic scatter in this relationship of $0.9$ dex, which does not vary over the redshift range of our sample. We also find that the $M_{\rm BH}/M_{\star}$ ratio increases by $2.3$ dex from $z = 3.5$ and $z = 6.5$ with a confidence level of $ > 3\sigma$. We attribute this trend with the increasing fraction of LRDs in our sample at $z>4$ as their host masses are $\sim1$ dex lower than the non-LRD AGN in our sample. These results support a picture in which the BHs powering JWST's broad-line AGN are genuinely overmassive and become increasingly so with redshift. We discuss the implications of our findings on early BH growth relative to that of their host galaxies and the constraints it places on BH seeding models.

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) occupy the $ 10^2 - 10^5\,M_\odot $ range, but their existence remains poorly constrained. Only a few candidates have been suggested in dwarf galaxies, globular clusters, and LIGO-Virgo-Kagra detections. To investigate their formation and demographics, we adopt two complementary approaches. We first analyze the \textsc{dragonii} direct $N$-body simulations, which follow clusters with up to $ 10^6 $ stars, capture IMBHs growth. We then employ the semi-analytic code \textsc{bpop}, calibrated on \textsc{dragonii}, to explore a broad range of cluster and cosmological conditions. Our models reproduce merger rates consistent with GWTC-3, with $\sim30 - 60\%$ of BBHs forming dynamically, mainly in globular and nuclear clusters. About 2-3\% of mergers involve an IMBH, producing intermediate-mass ratio inspirals. The IMBH mass distribution spans $2.5 \times 10^2 - 4 \times 10^4\,M_\odot $, with rare growth beyond $10^6\,M_\odot$. Formation efficiency rises with initial binary fraction but declines in metal-rich environments. IMBHs thus emerge as a distinct population bridging stellar and supermassive black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of density variations in stellar streams are a promising probe of low-mass dark matter substructure in the Milky Way. However, survey systematics such as variations in seeing and sky brightness can also induce artificial fluctuations in the observed densities of known stellar streams. These variations arise because survey conditions affect both object detection and star-galaxy misclassification rates. To mitigate these effects, we use Balrog synthetic source injections in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 data to calculate detection rate variations and classification rates as functions of survey properties. We show that these rates are nearly separable with respect to survey properties and can be estimated with sufficient statistics from the synthetic catalogs. Applying these corrections reduces the standard deviation of relative detection rates across the DES footprint by a factor of five, and our corrections significantly change the inferred linear density of the Phoenix stream when including faint objects. Additionally, for artificial streams with DES like survey properties we are able to recover density power spectra with reduced bias. We also find that uncorrected power-spectrum results for LSST-like data can be around five times more biased, highlighting the need for such corrections in future ground based surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We review the state of the evidence for the existence and observational appearance of supermassive black hole binaries. Such objects are expected from standard hierarchical galaxy evolution to form after two galaxies, each containing a supermassive black hole, have merged, in the centre of the merger remnant. A complex interaction is predicted to take place with stars and gas in the host galaxy, leading to observable signatures in weakly as well as actively accreting phases. Direct observational evidence is available and shows examples of dual active galactic nuclei from kpc scales down to parsec scales. Signatures of possibly closer supermassive black hole binaries may be seen in jetted black holes. The interaction with stars and gas in a galaxy significantly affects the hardening of the binary and hence contributes to uncertainties of the expected gravitational wave signal. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should in the future detect actual mergers. Before the launch of LISA, pulsar timing arrays may have the best chance to detect a gravitational wave signal from supermassive black hole binaries. The first signs of the combined background of inspiralling objects might have been seen already.

#### Good things always come in 3s: trimodality in the binary black-hole chirp-mass distribution supports bimodal black-hole formation

 - **Abstract**
 The latest GWTC-4 release from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration nearly doubles the known population of double compact object mergers and reveals a new trimodal structure in the chirp-mass distribution of merging binary black holes (BBHs) below 30 Msun. Recent detailed stellar evolution models show that features in the pre-collapse cores of massive stars produce a bimodal black hole (BH) mass distribution, which naturally extends to a trimodal BBH chirp-mass distribution. Both distributions depend only weakly on metallicity, implying universal structural features which can be tested with LVK observations. Using a new compact-remnant mass prescription derived from these models, we perform rapid population synthesis simulations to test the robustness of the predicted chirp-mass structure against uncertainties in binary evolution and cosmic star formation history, and compare these results with the current observational data. The trimodal chirp-mass distribution emerges as a robust outcome of the new remnant-mass model, persisting across variations in binary and cosmic physics. In contrast, traditional BH formation models lacking a bimodal BH mass spectrum fail to reproduce the observed trimodality. The updated models also predict lower BBH merger rates by a factor of a few, in closer agreement with LVK constraints. Intriguingly, the central chirp-mass peak, dominated by unequal-mass BBHs, originates from a previously underappreciated formation pathway in which strong luminous blue variable winds suppress binary interaction before the first BH forms. If isolated binary evolution dominates BBH formation below 30 Msun, the relative heights of the three chirp-mass peaks offer powerful observational constraints on core collapse, BH formation, binary evolution, and cosmic star formation. These universal structural features may also serve as standard sirens for precision cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 The peculiar velocities of supernovae and their host galaxies are correlated with the large-scale structure of the Universe, and can be used to constrain the growth rate of structure and test the cosmological model. In this work, we measure the correlation statistics of the large-scale structure traced by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Bright Galaxy Survey Data Release 1 sample, and magnitude fluctuations of type Ia supernova from the Pantheon+ compilation across redshifts z < 0.1. We find a detection of the cross-correlation signal between galaxies and type Ia supernova magnitudes. Fitting the normalised growth rate of structure f sigma_8 to the auto- and cross-correlation function measurements we find f sigma_8 = 0.384 +0.094 -0.157, which is consistent with the Planck LambdaCDM model prediction, and indicates that the supernova magnitude fluctuations are induced by peculiar velocities. Using a large ensemble of N-body simulations, we validate our methodology, calibrate the covariance of the measurements, and demonstrate that our results are insensitive to supernova selection effects. We highlight the potential of this methodology for measuring the growth rate of structure, and forecast that the next generation of type Ia supernova surveys will improve f sigma_8 constraints by a further order of magnitude.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave detectors are observing an increasing number of binary black hole (BBH) mergers, revealing a bimodal mass distribution of BBHs, which hints at diverse formation histories for these systems. Using the rapid binary population synthesis code MOBSE, we simulate a series of population synthesis models that include chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE). By considering metallicity-specific star formation and selection effects, we compare the intrinsic merger rates and detection rates of each model with observations. We find that the observed peaks in the mass distribution of merging BBHs at the low-mass end (10\msun) and the high-mass end (35\msun) are contributed by the common envelope channel or stable mass transfer channel (depending on the stability criteria for mass transfer) and the CHE channel, respectively, in our model. The merger rates and detection rates predicted by our model exhibit significant sensitivity to the choice of physical parameters. Different models predict merger rates ranging from 15.4 to $96.7\,\rm{Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ at redshift $z$ = 0.2, and detection rates ranging from 22.2 to 148.3$\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ under the assumption of a detectable redshift range of $z \le$ 1.0.

#### Probing departures from $Λ$CDM by late-time datasets

 - **Abstract**
 Observational data play a pivotal role in identifying cosmological models that are both theoretically consistent and empirically viable. In this work, we investigate whether the standard $\Lambda$CDM model exhibits significant departure with current late time datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI DR2, and various Type Ia supernova compilations (Pantheon$^+$, DES-SN5Y, Union3). We analyze several dynamical dark energy models, including $\omega$CDM, o$\omega$CDM, $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE. While CC + DESI DR2 data show mild deviations from $\Lambda$CDM ($\lesssim 2\sigma$), adding supernova samples (DES-SN5Y or Union3) increases deviations, with BA, JBP, and Logarithmic models reaching $3-3.5\sigma$, and CC + DESI DR2 + DES-SN5Y producing the largest deviations. We find consistent evidence for $\omega_0 > -1$ and $\omega_a < 0$ in all dark energy models, indicating that the cosmological constant faces a potential crisis and that dynamical dark energy models could provide a possible solution, characterized by a Quintom-B type scenario. The $\Lambda$CDM model has long served as the cornerstone of modern cosmology, successfully shaping our understanding of the Universe from its earliest epochs to the present day. However, in light of DESI DR2 and other recent measurements, emerging cracks in this paradigm suggest that a complete understanding of the cosmos may require moving beyond the cosmological constant and exploring new physics governing the dark sector.

#### The dark sector of the Universe as a scalar field in Horndeski Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 In the present work, we study a subclass of Horndeski gravity characterized by a non-minimal derivative coupling between a scalar field and the Einstein tensor, as a possible alternative to alleviate the observational tension associated with estimates of the Hubble constant $H_{0}$. Two scenarios within a flat FRW spacetime were considered. In the first case, the scalar field mimics cold dark matter, whereas in the second case, it acts as dark energy. We derive the dynamical equations and perform a statistical analysis using observational data of $H(z)$, obtaining constraints for the cosmological parameters. The results indicate that the model can effectively fit the cosmic expansion rate at late epochs, providing values of $H_{0}$ that are more compatible with local measurements. These results suggest that the non-minimal coupling sector in the Horndeski context constitutes a viable and promising approach to alleviate the $H_{0}$ tension and investigate scenarios beyond the standard cosmological model.

#### AT 2018cow at ~5 years: additional evidence for a tidal disruption origin

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08505

 - **Abstract**
 The Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient (LFBOT) AT 2018cow is the prototype of its class with an extensive set of multi-wavelength observations. Despite a rich data set there is, still, no consensus about the physical nature and origin of this event. AT 2018cow remained UV bright 2-4 years after the explosion, which points at an additional energy injection source, most likely from an accretion disk. We present additional late time UV data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, to show there is no significant fading in the optical since the last epoch and only marginal fading in the UV. The new UV data points match the predictions of previously published accretion disk models, where the disk is assumed to form from the tidal disruption of a low mass star by an intermediate mass black hole. This consistency provides evidence that AT 2018cow could indeed be a tidal disruption event. The marginal decay is in contrast with the predictions of light curves produced by interacting supernovae. The difference between expectations for disc emission and interacting supernovae will further increase with time, making data at even later times a route to robustly rule out interaction between supernova ejecta and circumstellar material.

 - **Abstract**
 In our recent work [Van de Moortel, The coexistence of null and spacelike singularities inside spherically symmetric black holes], we analyzed the transition between null and spacelike singularities in spherically symmetric dynamical black holes and demonstrated that the spacelike portion is described by a Kasner metric with positive varying exponents that degenerate to $(1,0,0)$ near the null-spacelike transition. In the present paper, we provide examples of global spacetimes satisfying the assumptions of this previous result and apply its analysis to obtain a large class of asymptotically flat (spherically symmetric) black hole spacetimes that exhibit coexisting null and spacelike singularities. Our main results include: _The construction of one-ended asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell-charged-scalar-field equations. The proof relies on a new spacelike-characteristic gluing method between any uncharged spherically symmetric solution and the event horizon of a charged dynamical black hole. _The construction of a large class of two-ended asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell-(uncharged)-scalar-field equations. In both cases, we show that the terminal boundary in the black hole interior only has two distinct components: a weakly singular (null) Cauchy horizon $\mathcal{CH}_{i^+}$ where curvature blows up and a strong singularity $\mathcal{S}=\{r=0\}$. Our construction provides the first examples of black holes with coexisting null and spacelike singularities. These examples hold particular significance in the one-ended case as a model of gravitational collapse, where this phenomenon is conjecturally generic for the Einstein-scalar-field model, even beyond spherical symmetry.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a rotating black hole embedded in a five-dimensional flat bulk by extending the Kerr metric through the Gurses-Gursey line element. Employing Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, we reinterpret the black hole as a charged-like object in five dimensions and analyze its horizon structure and shadow morphology. Our results reveal that the shadow is shaped by an axially symmetric gravitational field modulated by an extrinsic curvature term arising from the higher-dimensional embedding. Simulations demonstrate that the visibility amplitude and shadow profile of the Gurses-Gursey black hole align with Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87 in the Kerr limit, while also allowing measurable deviations that could be probed by future high-resolution experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 In this second paper of our series started with \cite{Berens2024}, we investigate linearized gravitational perturbations of a rotating Kerr black hole in a non-asymptotically flat spacetime with (anti-)de Sitter boundary conditions. Here, we explicitly write down the metric components (in both ingoing and outgoing radiation gauge) of the perturbations that correspond to a given mode of either Weyl scalar. We provide formulas involving Hertz potentials (intermediate quantities with a holographic interpretation) as well as some that involve only the separated radial and angular modes. We expect these analytic results to prove useful in numerical studies of black hole perturbation theory in the context of the holographic correspondence.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study the kinematic effects of spinning test particles orbiting the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black hole. Employing with the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, we explore the dynamics of precessing orbits and distinct orbital types, including circular orbits and innermost stable circular orbits. Our results reveal the substantial impact of the magnetic field on the trajectories of spinning particles, particularly in regions characterized by significant radial distances. More importantly, our study shows that an augmented magnetic field necessitates an increased orbital angular momentum to uphold spinning particles within their characteristic orbits at equivalent radial distances. Our result contributes valuable insights to the understanding of the spinning celestial object motion around black holes endowed with magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Th spontaneous scalarization of the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg (EEH) black hole is performed in the EEH-scalar theory by introducing an exponential scalar coupling (with $\alpha$ coupling constant) to the Maxwell this http URL, the EEH black hole as a blad black hole is described by mass $M$ and magnetic charge $q$ with an action parameter $\mu$. A choice of $\mu=0.3$ gurantees a single horizon with unrestricted magnetic charge $q$. The onset scalarization of this black hole appears for a positive coupling $\alpha$ with an unlimited magnetic charge $q$. However, there exists a difference between $q\le1$ and $q>1$ onset scalarizations. We notify the presence of infinite branches labeled by the number of $n=0,1,2,\cdots$ of scalarized charged black holes by taking into account the scalar seeds around the EEH black hole. We find that the $n=0$ fundamental branch of all scalarized black holes is stable against the radial perturbations, while the $n=1$ excited branch is unstable.

 - **Abstract**
 In studies of binary black hole (BBH) mergers in eccentric orbits, the mean anomaly, traditionally regarded as less significant than eccentricity, has been thought to encode only the orbital phase, leading to the assumption that it exerts minimal influence on the dynamics of eccentric mergers. In a previous investigation, we identified consistent oscillations in dynamical quantities peak luminosity $L_{\text{peak}}$, remnant mass $M_{\text{rem}}$, spin $\alpha_{\text{rem}}$, and recoil velocity $V_{\text{rem}}$ in relation to the initial eccentricity $e_0$. These oscillations are associated with integer orbital cycles within a phenomenological framework. In this paper, we aim to explore the underlying physical nature of these oscillations through gravitational waveforms. Our examination of remnant mass and spin reveals that while the initial ADM mass $M_{\mathrm{ADM}}$ and orbital angular momentum $L_0$ exhibit gradual variations with $e_0$, the radiated energy $E_{\text{rad}}$ and angular momentum $L_{\text{rad}}$ display oscillatory patterns akin to those observed in $M_{\text{rem}}$ and $\alpha_{\text{rem}}$. By decomposing the waveforms into three distinct phases inspiral, late inspiral to merger, and ringdown, we demonstrate that these oscillations persist across all phases, suggesting a common origin. Through a comparative analysis of $E_{\text{rad}}$ and $L_{\text{rad}}$ derived from numerical relativity (NR), post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms, and orbital-averaged PN fluxes during the inspiral phase, we identify the initial mean anomaly $l_0$ as the source of the observed oscillations. ...

 - **Abstract**
 We study the gravitational perturbation theory of black holes in noncommutative spacetimes with noncommutativity of the type $[t\stackrel{\star}{,} r] = i a \alpha A(r)$ and $[\varphi \stackrel{\star}{,} r] = i a \beta A(r)$ for arbitrary $A(r)$, which includes several Moyal-type spaces and also the $\kappa$-Minkowski space. The main result of this paper is an analytical expression for the effective potential of the axial perturbation modes, valid to all orders in the noncommutativity parameter. This is achieved by evaluating the $\star$-products using translations in the radial direction, i.e., Bopp shift. We comment on various regimes, such as Planck-scale black holes, where the noncommutativity length scale is of the same order of magnitude as the black hole horizon.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a full Hamiltonian constraint analysis of pure Ricci-scalar-squared ($R^2$) gravity to clarify recent controversies regarding its particle spectrum. While it is well established that the full theory consistently propagates three degrees of freedom, we confirm that its linearised spectrum around Minkowski spacetime is empty. moreover, we show that this is not a feature unique to Minkowski spacetime, but a generic property of all traceless-Ricci spacetimes that have a vanishing Ricci scalar, such as the Schwarzschild and Kerr black hole spacetimes. The mechanism for this phenomenon is a change in the nature of the constraints upon linearisation: ten second-class constraints of the full theory become first-class, while the three momentum constraints degenerate into a single constraint. Furthermore, we show that higher order perturbation theory around these singular backgrounds reveals no degrees of freedom at any order. This is in conflict with the general analysis and points to the fact that such backgrounds are surfaces of strong coupling in field space, where the dynamics of perturbations becomes nonperturbative. We further show via a cosmological phase-space analysis that the evolving universe is able to penetrate through the singular $R=0$ surface.

 - **Abstract**
 Limits on the dark matter fraction of small mass primordial black holes from Hawking radiation are predominantly derived from the assumption of a Schwarzschild black hole evaporating. However, astrophysical black holes are usually much more realistically modelled by the rotating Kerr black hole solution. Meanwhile, electromagnetically charged black holes are astrophysically of little importance due to their fast neutralisation in the present universe. Dark matter is not just a possible solution to issues of astrophysics and cosmology, but also to issues of the standard model of particle physics. Extensions of this model thus can lead to charges present in the early universe which remain preserved in the charge of primordial black holes - even when the corresponding particles have disappeared from the particle content of the present epoch of the universe. Here, we report on a thorough proof-of-concept that such charges can greatly change evaporation limits for primordial black hole dark matter. Special emphasis is placed on (near-)extremal black holes, for which this effect is especially pronounced.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyra geometry provides an interesting approach to develop purely geometrical scalar-tensor theories due to the natural presence of the Lyra scale function. This paper explores further the scale function source term to construct a theory on Lyra manifolds which contains proper generalizations of both Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory. It is shown that the symmetry group of gravitational theories on the Lyra geometry comprises not only coordinate transformations but also local transformations of length units, so that the Lyra function is the conformal factor which locally fixes the unit of length. By performing a Lyra transformation to a frame in which the unit of length is globally fixed, it is shown that General Relativity is obtained from the Lyra Scalar-Tensor Theory (LyST). Through the same procedure, even in the presence of matter fields, it is found that Brans-Dicke gravity and the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor theory are obtained from their Lyra counterparts. It is argued that this approach is consistent with the Mach-Dicke principle, since the strength of gravity in Brans-Dicke-Lyra is controlled by the scale function. It might be possible that any known scalar-tensor theory can be naturally geometrized by considering a particular Lyra frame, for which the scalar field is the function which locally controls the unit of length. The Jordan-Einstein frame conundrum is also assessed from the perspective of Lyra transformations, it is shown that the Lyra geometry makes explicit that the two frames are only different representations of the same theory, so that in the Einstein frame the unit of length varies locally. The Lyra formalism is then shown to be better suited for exploring scalar-tensor gravity, since in its well-defined structure the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor and geodesic motion are assured in the Einstein frame.

 - **Abstract**
 The final-parsec problem has long posed a central challenge in understanding the merger of supermassive black hole binaries. In this paper, we investigate a scenario in which a dark scalar or vector field is sourced by eccentric binaries, leading to accelerated mergers through additional dipole radiation, and thereby extending the range of masses for which the binary merges within a Hubble time. The radiation fluxes from an eccentric charged Keplerian binary are derived using general results for localized periodic sources in flat spacetime. We find that dipole radiation, although insufficient to fully resolve the final-parsec problem, can alter the low-frequency spectrum of the stochastic gravitational-wave background from supermassive black hole binary inspirals. We construct a simplified model for the spectrum and perform a Bayesian analysis using the current pulsar timing array data.

 - **Abstract**
 We study classical scattering of charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory. Working in the classical (Post-Minkowskian) regime, we extract the conservative two-body potential by expanding the one loop amplitudes in the soft regime. We show explicitly that, as in GR, the relevant soft amplitudes are infrared (IR) finite once the long-range interactions are consistently treated via Lippmann-Schwinger equation and the associated IR subtraction. The scattering angle is then obtained from the eikonal exponentiation of the soft amplitude. Our results track the separate roles of electromagnetic and dilatonic charges in both the conservative dynamics and the eikonal phase, and they reduce smoothly to the GR limit when the charges and dilaton coupling are switched off. Where applicable, we compare with existing results in the literature and find agreement. These findings provide amplitude-based benchmarks for compact-object dynamics in EMD and furnish building blocks for waveform modeling in beyond-GR scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Disformal couplings to fermions lead to a unique derivative coupling to the axial fermionic current, which contains higher derivatives in general. We derive general conditions on consistent disformal couplings by requiring the absence of higher time derivatives, as they typically lead to ghost degrees of freedom. For a two-scalar field disformal transformation, we show that the consistent disformal coupling must have a degenerate field space metric. This allows us to explore consistent, new two-scalar field modified gravity models. We show that the transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action leads to two-field Horndeski or two-field DHOST theories. Our formalism also applies to disformal transformations with higher derivatives. We derive the consistent subclasses of disformal transformations that include second derivatives of a scalar field and first derivatives of a vector field that lead to generalized U-DHOST and degenerate beyond generalized Proca theories.

 - **Abstract**
 We study various types of holographic solutions from five-dimensional $N=4$ gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets with $SO(2)\times ISO(3)$ gauge group. This gauged supergravity can be obtained from the maximal gauged supergravity in seven dimensions on a Riemann surface. For a negatively curved Rimann surface $H^2$, the resulting five-dimensional gauged supergravity admits a supersymmetric $N=4$ $AdS_5$ critical point. This $AdS_5$ vacuum is dual to an $N=2$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) arising from M5-branes wrapped on $H^2$. We study holographic RG flow solutions describing deformations of this SCFT by turning on relevant, marginal and irrelevant operators to $N=2$ non-conformal phases in the IR. Solutions describing conformal interfaces between these non-conformal phases and singular boundaries are also given. We finally study a number of supersymmetric $AdS_5$ black string and black hole solutions holographically dual to RG flows across dimensions from the $N=2$ SCFT to two-dimensional SCFTs and superconformal quantum mechanics in the IR. All of the solutions can be uplifted to M-theory by a consistent truncation on $H^2\times S^4$.
