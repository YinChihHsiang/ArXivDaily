 - **Abstract**
 We present a timing analysis of the black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) 4U 1630-47 using AstroSat observations from 10-19 March 2023, for the first time capturing a rare and rapid transition in variability properties. Within less than a day, the source evolved from a type-C quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) state, with centroid frequencies between 3-5 Hz, to the Heartbeat state, characterized by a broad peak in the power density spectrum at ~25 mHz, corresponding to a ~40 s modulation period. As the source evolved, it passed through a transition track where the QPO features weakened and ultimately disappeared in the Heartbeat state. In the hardness-intensity Diagram, the QPOs occur at higher hardness and lower intensity, followed by a brightening phase as the source moved towards the soft intermediate state, and finally reached the Heartbeat state through a transition towards lower hardness. In the power-color diagram, this transition is marked by a clear shift to a distinct region of power color space, separate from the range occupied by other observed states. This work establishes 4U 1630-47 as another system, apart from GRS 1915+105, where a continuous transition from QPO to Heartbeat state has been observed. Notably, 4U 1630-47 is the only system where the QPO is absent during the heartbeat state. This provides us with another probe to understand the physical mechanism governing this transition and the overall accretion mechanism in BHXRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing arrays are sensitive to low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), such as those produced by supermassive binary black holes at subparsec separations. The incoherent superposition of GWs emitted by a cosmological population of these sources produces a gravitational wave background (GWB), while some individual sources may be resolvable as deterministic signals with slowly varying GW frequencies, which are often referred to as "continuous waves" (CWs). The Fp-statistic is a frequentist method of detecting these CWs. In this paper, we study how the presence of pulsar red noise and a GWB affect the Fp-statistic. We compare results when marginalizing over the red noise and using the maximum-likelihood values of the red noise, and find little difference between the two. We also present results of using the Fp-statistic to analyze the NANOGrav 12.5-year data set, where we find no evidence for CWs in agreement with the previously published Bayesian results.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasars acting as strong gravitational lenses offer a rare opportunity to probe the redshift evolution of scaling relations between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, particularly the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\mathrm{host}}$ relation. Using these powerful probes, the mass of the host galaxy can be precisely inferred from the Einstein radius $\theta_{\mathrm{E}}$. Using 812{,}118 quasars from DESI DR1 ($0.03 \leq z \leq 1.8$), we searched for quasars lensing higher-redshift galaxies by identifying background emission-line features in their spectra. To detect these rare systems, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on mock lenses constructed from real DESI spectra of quasars and emission-line galaxies (ELGs), achieving a high classification performance (AUC = 0.99). We also trained a regression network to estimate the redshift of the background ELG. Applying this pipeline, we identified seven high-quality (Grade~A) lens candidates, each exhibiting a strong [O\,\textsc{ii}] doublet at a higher redshift than the foreground quasar; four candidates additionally show H$\beta$ and [O\,\textsc{iii}] emission. These results significantly expand the sample of quasar lens candidates beyond the twelve identified and three confirmed in previous work, and demonstrate the potential for scalable, data-driven discovery of quasars as strong lenses in upcoming spectroscopic surveys.

#### Plasma flow in force-free magnetospheres: two-fluid model near pulsars and black holes

 - **Abstract**
 Force-free electrodynamics describes the electromagnetic field of the magnetically dominated plasma found near pulsars and active black holes, but gives no information about the underlying particles that ultimately produce the observable emission. Working in the two-fluid approximation, we show how particles can be "painted on" to a force-free solution as a function of boundary conditions that encode the particle output of "gap regions" where the force-free approximation does not hold. These boundary conditions also determine the leading parallel electric field in the entire magnetosphere. Our treatment holds in a general (possibly curved) spacetime and is phrased in language intrinsic to the 1+1 dimensional "field sheet spacetimes" experienced by particles stuck to magnetic field lines. Besides the new results, this provides an elegant formulation of some standard equations; for example, we show that the zero-gyroradius guiding center approximation is just the Lorentz force law on the field sheet. We derive a general perturbative method and apply it to pulsar and black hole magnetospheres with radial magnetic fields to produce fully analytic models that capture key features of the full problem. When applied to more realistic magnetic field configurations together with simulation-informed boundary conditions for the gap regions, this approach has the potential to provide global magnetosphere models without the need for global particle-in-cell simulations.

#### Primordial Black Holes from Kinetic Preheating

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that violent kinetic preheating following inflation can lead to the formation of black holes in the early Universe. In $\alpha$-attractor models with derivative inflaton couplings, nonlinear amplification of field fluctuations drives large spacetime curvature and gravitational collapse shortly after inflation ends. Using fully general-relativistic lattice simulations, we find that these dynamics produce black holes with masses of order tens of grams at sub-horizon scales, without requiring large primordial curvature perturbations. Although such micro-black holes evaporate rapidly via Hawking radiation, their formation modifies the post-inflationary equation of state and their evaporation can successfully reheat the Universe before Big Bang nucleosynthesis. These results identify kinetic preheating as a new, efficient channel for black-hole production and establish a direct connection between inflationary symmetries and strong-gravity phenomena at reheating.

 - **Abstract**
 Since their discovery more than 60 years ago, accreting supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN) were recognized as highly variable sources, requiring an extremely compact, dynamic environment. Their variability traces to multiple phenomena, including changing accretion rates, temperature changes, foreground absorbers, and structural changes to the accretion disk. Spurred by a new generation of time-domain surveys, the extremes of black hole variability are now being probed. We report the discovery of an extreme flare by the AGN J224554.84+374326.5, which brightened by more than a factor of 40 in 2018. The source has slowly faded since then. The total emitted UV/optical energy to date is $\sim10^{54}$ erg, i.e., the complete conversion of approximately one solar mass into electromagnetic radiation. This flare is 30 times more powerful than the previous most powerful AGN transient. Very few physical events in the Universe can liberate this much electromagnetic energy. We discuss potential mechanisms, including the tidal disruption of a high mass $(>30\, M_\odot)$ star, gravitational lensing of an AGN flare or supernova, or a supermassive (pair instability) supernova in the accretion disk of an AGN. We favor the tidal disruption of a massive star in a prograde orbit in an AGN disk.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed 77 epochs of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) archival data to investigate flux variability in Sagittarius A$^*$ (Sgr A$^*$), the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center. Among these, we identified a rare but unusually clear and coherent ~52-minute sinusoidal modulation at 230 GHz, with a statistical significance exceeding 5{\sigma}. Modeling with a Doppler-boosted hotspot scenario yields an orbital radius of ~4 Schwarzschild radii and a disk inclination of 8$^\circ$ (or 172$^\circ$), providing the first direct millimeter wavelength constraint on the inner accretion flow geometry. This nearly face-on inclination is in good agreement with previous constraints from GRAVITY and EHT observations. These findings provide robust, independent evidence that millimeter-wave periodicity can directly probe the innermost accretion flow geometry, offering a powerful complement to variability studies at infrared and X-ray wavelengths.

 - **Abstract**
 Using a model-independent Gaussian process (GP) method to reconstruct the dimensionless luminosity distance $D$ and its derivatives, we derive the evolution of the dimensionless Hubble parameter $E$, the deceleration parameter $q$, and the state parameter $w$ of dark energy. We utilize the PantheonPlus, SH0ES, and Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) data to derive the dimensionless luminosity distance $D$. Additionally, we employ observational $H(z)$ data (OHD) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) to obtain the first derivative of the dimensionless luminosity distance $D^{'}$. To obtain the reconstructed $D$ and $D^{'}$, we utilize the fiducial value from each dataset, with particular emphasis on the varying $H_0$. According to the reconstruction results obtained from PantheonPlus+SH0ES+GRB+OHD and PantheonPlus+SH0ES+GRB+OHD+DESI data, we find that $E$ are consistent with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model at a $2\sigma$ confidence level within the redshift range of $z<2$. However, the reconstruction results for $q$ exhibit deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model in the range of $z<0.3$. Furthermore, we observe that the mean value of $w$ exhibits evolving behavior, transiting from $w < -1$ to $w > -1$ around $z_{\rm wt}=0.464^{+0.235}_{-0.120}$. Combining data from DESI DR2 can slightly enhance the accuracy of our constraints.

#### Redshift-dependent Distance Duality Violation in Resolving Multidimensional Cosmic Tensions

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate whether violations of the distance-duality relation (DDR) can resolve the multidimensional cosmic tensions characterized by the $H_0$ and $S_8$ discrepancies. Using the Fisher-bias formalism, we reconstruct minimal, data-driven $\eta(z)$ profiles that capture the late-time deviations required to reconcile early- and late-Universe calibrations. While a constant DDR offset preserves the Pantheon-inferred matter density $\Omega_m = 0.334 \pm 0.018$--leaving its inconsistency with the Planck best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model and weak-lensing surveys unresolved--a time-varying DDR substantially reduces cross-dataset inconsistencies and improves the global fit, yielding $\Delta\chi^2 \simeq -10$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM when the SH0ES prior is excluded. This result suggests that the $\Omega_m$ discrepancy may represent indirect evidence for a time-varying DDR. A hybrid scenario combining a time-dependent DDR with a phantom-like dark energy transition achieves the most consistent global reconciliation, reducing the tension with DES-Y3 measurements to below $2\sigma$. These findings indicate that a mild DDR violation, coupled with evolving dark energy, offers a coherent pathway toward jointly addressing the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions.

#### Supernova Classification using the Recurrent Neural Network in the CSST Ultra-Deep Field Survey

 - **Abstract**
 We study supernova (SN) classification using the machine learning method of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope Ultra-Deep Field (CSST-UDF) photometric survey, and explore the improvement of the cosmological constraint. We generate the mock light curve data of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) and core collapse supernova (CCSN) using SNCosmo with SALT3 SN Ia model and CCSN templates, and apply the SuperNNova (SNN) program for classifying SNe. Our study indicates that the SNN combined with the Joint Light-curve Analysis like (JLA-like) cuts can enhance the purity of the CSST-UDF SN Ia sample up to over 99.5% with 2,193 SNe Ia and 4 CCSNe, which can significantly increase the reliability of the cosmological constraint results. The method based on the Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species (BEAMS) with Bias Corrections (BBC) framework is used to correct the SN Ia magnitude bias caused by the selection effect and CCSN contamination, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed for cosmological constraints. We find that the accuracy of the constraints on the matter density $\Omega_{\rm M}$ and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ can achieve 14% and 18%, respectively, assuming the flat $w$CDM model. This result is comparable to that from the current surveys that relied on spectroscopic confirmation. It indicates that our data analysis method is effective, and the CSST-UDF SN photometric survey is powerful in exploring the expansion history of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying large samples of massive, passively evolving galaxies (called cosmic chronometers, CC) provides us with the unique ability to measure the Universe's expansion history without assuming a cosmological model. The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1 is currently the largest, publicly available, homogeneous set of galaxies with reliable spectroscopic redshifts, and covers a wide range in redshift. We extracted all massive galaxies (stellar mass $\log M_{\star}/M_{\odot} > 10.75$, and velocity dispersion $\sigma > 280$ km s$^{-1}$), with no emission in [OII] $\lambda$ 3727 $Å$, with reliable redshifts as well as reliable D4000$_{\rm n}$ measurements from DR1. From this sample of 360 000 massive, passive galaxies, we used D4000$_{\rm n}$ and the method of cosmic chronometers to get three new direct, independent measurements of $H(z)=$ 88.48 $\pm\ 0.57(\rm stat) \pm 12.32(\rm syst)$, $H(z)=$ 119.45 $\pm\ 6.39(\rm stat) \pm 16.64(\rm syst)$, and $H(z)= 108.28 \pm 10.07(\rm stat) \pm 15.08(\rm syst)$ $\rm km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}$ at $z=0.46$, $z=0.67$, and $z=0.83$, respectively. This sample, which covers $0.3 < z < 1.0$, is the largest CC sample to date, and we reach statistical uncertainties of 0.65$\%$, 5.35$\%$, and 9.30$\%$ on our three measurements. Our measurements show no significant tension with the $\textit{Planck}$ $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In our analysis, we also illustrate that even amongst samples of massive, passive galaxies, the effect of downsizing can clearly be seen.

#### Solving the cooling flow problem with combined jet-wind AGN feedback

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02796

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback is widely viewed as the most promising solution to the long-standing cooling flow problem in galaxy clusters, yet previous models prescribe jet properties inconsistent with accretion physics. We perform high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cluster using the MACER framework, incorporating both jets and winds constrained by general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and observations. The combined feedback reproduces key observables--including cold gas mass, star formation rate, thermodynamic radial profiles, and black hole growth--while jet-only or wind-only models fail. The success arises from turbulence driven by jet-wind shear that enhances kinetic-to-thermal energy conversion, boosting heating efficiency by factors of three and six relative to wind-only and jet-only cases, respectively, yielding a self-consistent solution to cluster cooling flows.

#### Quasi-normal modes ratios as agnostic test of general relativity

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02010

 - **Abstract**
 In this letter, we provide a novel test of general relativity based on ringdown analysis. The test is performed on agnostic models, where the postmerger signal is fitted with a superposition of damped sinusoids. If at least two modes are detected, one has to compute the ratio of the frequencies and of the damping times and compare them against the predictions of general relativity. By considering ratios, the dependency on the black hole's mass is scaled away. Most notably, we find that the ratios vary very little with the spin, the real part depends mostly on the angular momentum of the mode $\ell$ and the imaginary part depends mostly on the overtone number $n$: different combinations create specific mode islands. We provide a qualitative explanation of these islands through a semi-analytical argument. We discuss the application of the method to future detectors. Finally, we show that ratios in alternative theories of gravity or between different field content drastically differ from those of general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 The observation of gravitational waves emitted during the merging phase of compact binary coalescing objects has opened a new field of investigation in fundamental physics. It is now possible to test the predictions of General Relativity with unprecedented precision in the strong gravitational field regime. These initial observations therefore call for further research, as the detection of gravitational waves emitted by coalescing black holes may allow the investigation of the properties of spacetime near the event horizon, also providing valuable information on the structure of these objects. This also opens the possibility of testing predictions from quantum gravity models regarding the presumed quantized structure of black holes, related to the quantization of their surface and, consequently, their entropy. In the future, the considerable amount of data obtained by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration will be followed by observations from next-generation interferometers such as the Einstein Telescope or the Cosmic Explorer. It is therefore of great interest to explore the potential of gravitational wave observations for investigating aspects of quantum gravity, which we will address considering the special case of the ringdown emission following the coalescence of binary black hole systems.

 - **Abstract**
 A family of exact solutions extending the Hayward black hole by incorporating multiple sources is obtained. The most comprehensive scenario describes a charged Hayward black hole with a cosmological constant, immersed in quintessence and accompanied by a cloud of strings. The study examines how the Kretschmann scalar varies with the parameters linked to the various sources and concludes with an analysis of the geodesics and the corresponding effective potential.

 Exact solutions which generalize the Bardeen black hole solution, in the sense that several sources are taken into account, are derived. The most general case corresponds to a charged Bardeen black hole with a cosmological constant and surrounded by quintessence and a cloud of strings. A discussion is presented concerning the Kretschmann scalar and its dependence with the parameters associated to the different sources. Finally, the geodesics and effective potential are analyzed.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02274

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the modified Teukolsky equation within a parameterized framework, analogous to the case of small deviations of potential in spherical symmetry. Both the radial and angular equations acquire modifications described by two independent sets of parameters. We derive the parameterized framework of the quasinormal mode spectra using the continued fraction method. The results are cross-validated with the two-dimensional pseudo-spectral method, demonstrating excellent agreement and ensuring self-consistency. This work establishes a robust foundation for a theory-agnostic interpretation of gravitational-wave ringdown signals, providing a practical tool for probing potential deviations from General Relativity in the strong-field regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical black holes are often surrounded by dark matter, which can influence their dynamics and observational signatures. In this work, we study a Schwarzschild-like black hole immersed in a Dehnen-type $(1,4,2)$ dark matter halo and analyse scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations in this spacetime. We compute quasinormal modes (QNMs) using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation method with Padé approximants, investigate particle motion and photon trajectories, and use black hole shadow observations to place constraints on the halo parameters. We further examine the greybody factors associated with Hawking radiation for different perturbation spins. This combined analysis aims to understand how dark matter environments may affect black hole oscillations, radiation properties, and the corresponding observational signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamical Love numbers capture the conservative response of an object to a time-dependent external tidal gravitational field. We compute the dynamical Love numbers of Schwarzschild black holes in general relativity within a point-particle effective field theory framework. In addition to the known logarithmic running, we compute the finite scheme-dependent contributions to the Love number couplings. We do this by matching the renormalized one-point function in the effective theory to the classical field profile computed in general relativity. On the general relativity side, we solve the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations perturbatively in a small frequency expansion. In order to match on the effective field theory side we include gravitational interactions using the Born series and employ dimensional regularization to obtain a renormalized field profile.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we explored the Hayward black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings, with a focus on the effects of the regularization parameter $l$ and the string cloud parameter $a$ on its observational properties and quasinormal modes (QNMs). Utilizing the spacetime metric and geodesic equations, we calculated several geometric quantities characterizing the black hole. To visualize the observational appearance of the accretion disk, we employed the Novikov--Thorne model to simulate both its primary and secondary images. Furthermore, we analyzed the QNMs of the black hole under scalar and electromagnetic perturbations for different parameter values. The results indicate that as the regularization parameter $l$ increases, the outer horizon radius $r_{+}$, photon-sphere radius $r_{\text{ph}}$, critical impact parameter $b_{c}$, and innermost stable circular orbit $r_{\text{isco}}$ exhibit a gradual decrease, while the inner horizon radius $r_{-}$ and the real part of the QNMs frequency $\omega_{r}$ increase. In contrast, as the string cloud parameter $a$ increases, $r_{+}$, $r_{\text{ph}}$, $b_{c}$, and $r_{\text{ isco}}$ demonstrate a rapid increase, whereas $r_{-}$ and $\omega_{r}$ decrease. In both cases, the absolute value of the imaginary part of the QNMs frequency decreases with the increase $l$ or $a$. This work offers a theoretical foundation for understanding the coupling between regular black holes and surrounding string clouds.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider rotating wormhole solutions in general relativity supported by a complex non-phantom spinor field (which provides a nontrivial spacetime topology) and electromagnetic fields. The solutions are asymmetric, regular, asymptotically flat and carry nonzero total angular momentum. The physical properties of the resulting configurations are completely determined by the values of three input quantities: the throat parameter, the spinor frequency, and the electromagnetic coupling constant. The wormholes connect two identical Minkowski spacetimes possessing in general different masses and global charges.

 - **Abstract**
 We prove that every open connected region of relativistic spacetime $(M,\textbf{g})$ that encloses a $b$-incomplete half-curve has an open connected subregion that encloses a $b$-incomplete half-curve and is also 'small' in the following sense: it is the image, under the bundle projection map, of some open region in the (connected) orthonormal frame bundle $O^+M$ over that spacetime which is bounded, and whose closure is Cauchy incomplete, with respect to any 'natural' distance function on $O^+M$. As a corollary, it follows that every $b$-incomplete half-curve can be covered by a sequence of singular regions which are images of a sequence of bounded subsets of $O^+M$ whose diameter, with respect to any 'natural' distance function on $O^+M$, tends to zero. We discuss to what extent these results can be interpreted in favour of the claim that singular structure in classical general relativity is 'localizable'.

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123 is a short-duration, low-frequency gravitational wave signal consistent with a binary black hole coalescence and dominated by the merger-ringdown regime due to the high mass of the source. We demonstrate that fits of this ringdown signal using two quasinormal modes are statistically preferred over single-mode fits, for a broad range of fit start times. We also find that two-mode fits give remnant mass and spin measurements consistent with those of the inspiral-merger-ringdown model NRSur7dq4, whereas one-mode fits struggle to do so. Agreement of our fits with those of NRSur7dq4 is achieved by labeling the two quasinormal modes as the ${(\ell,m)=(2,2)}$ and ${(2,0)}$ Kerr prograde fundamental modes. However, we find some indications that fits with the ${(2,1)}$ quasinormal mode instead of the ${(2,0)}$ mode may describe the data better, hinting at possible NRSur7dq4 error or other systematics. When fitting at early times near the estimated peak strain, we find that the inclusion of a third mode, an ${(\ell,m,n)=(2,2,1)}$ prograde overtone, improves consistency with fits at later times. Finally, we perform a test of general relativity by searching for deviations from the Kerr frequency spectrum. Setting issues of systematics aside, we validate the Kerr frequency and damping rate spectrum to within $\pm10\%$ at the 90$\%$ credible level using a fundamental mode fit, and we also report $\pm8\%$ constraints using a model with fundamental modes and an overtone fit at times near the peak strain. Understanding the systematic errors that may be affecting the most accurate analyses of GW231123 is crucial in the context of population and binary formation studies -- our ${(2,1)}$ mode fits return a significantly higher remnant mass and spin than all available inspiral-merger-ringdown models including NRSur7dq4, and this difference in parameter estimates may have astrophysical implications.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations suggest that the accelerated expansion of the Universe at late times is caused by a temporally changing dark energy component, rather than the constant one in the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario. In this context quintessence, i.e. a canonical scalar field minimally coupled to gravity, plays a prominent role. There are, however, three main types of quintessence models: thawing quintessence, scaling freezing quintessence, and tracking quintessence. Dynamical systems reformulations of the field equations for a broad set of scalar field potentials, including some new ones, allow us to use dynamical systems methods to derive global and asymptotic features, visualised in bounded state space pictures clearly illustrating the relationships and properties of the different types of quintessence, clarifying initial data issues, and yielding simple and accurate approximations.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider detailed cosmological tests of dark energy models obtained from the general conformal transformation of the Kropina metric, representing an $(\alpha,\beta)$-type Finslerian geometry. In particular, we restrict our analysis to the osculating Barthel-Kropina geometry. The Kropina metric function is defined as the ratio of the square of a Riemannian metric $\alpha$ and of the one-form $\beta$. In this framework we also consider the role of the conformal transformations of the metric, which allows to introduce a family of conformal Barthel-Kropina theories in an osculating geometry. The models obtained in this way are described by second order field equations, in the presence of an effective scalar field induced by the conformal factor. The generalized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the Riemannian metric $\alpha$ the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker representation. In order to close the cosmological field equations we assume a specific relationship between the component of the one-form $\beta$ and the conformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is determined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free parameter $\gamma$ of the model. The conformal Barthel-Kropina cosmological models are compared against several observational datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which allows the determination of $\gamma$. A comparison with the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM model is also performed. Our results indicate that the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina model can be considered as a successful, and simple, alternative to standard cosmological models.

#### Nested Apparent Horizons and Quantized Separation from Intense Hawking Backreaction

 - **Abstract**
 When Hawking radiation from a rotating or non-rotating black hole becomes sufficiently intense, its own stress energy can no longer be treated as a perturbation on a fixed background. In this regime the outgoing flux may generate an additional, transient trapping surf ace exterior to the original event horizon. Using a simple spherically symmetric semi classical model we demonstrate that strong outgoing null energy can create nested apparent horizons, a feature reminiscent of the Penrose process but mediated by quantum back reaction. The effect is illustrated using a smooth Vaidya type mass profile, and conditions for bifurcation and merger of horizons are derived. We further propose that the separation between nested horizons may obey a discrete quantization rule analogous to the Bohr Sommerfeld condition,suggesting a geometric route toward quantum-gravity discreteness.

#### Single-Sided Black Holes in Double-Scaled SYK Model and No Man's Island

 - **Abstract**
 We study a single-sided black hole with an end-of-the-world (EoW) brane behind horizon in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model. The new Hamiltonian is a deformation of the original DSSYK Hamiltonian with an additional exponential wormhole length operator, which leads to a new chord diagram rule. The boundary algebra is defined as generated by the new Hamiltonian and boundary matter, analogous to the original DSSYK. There is an alternative definition with a $q$-coherent state, which can be shown to be equivalent to the former by a nontrivial isomorphism of the von Neumann algebra of DSSYK. This isomorphism induces an unitary equivalence, which yields a surprising result that the boundary algebra of a single-sided black hole in DSSYK has a non-trivial commutant and is still a type $\text{II}_1$ von Neumann factor. It follows that the full bulk reconstruction from the boundary is impossible, and we demonstrate that the non-trivial commutant leads to the existence of a ``no man's island" behind the horizon in the semiclassical JT gravity limit. We take a few different ways to understand the nontrivial commutant of the boundary algebra of a single-sided black hole. We show that the commutant is indeed non-geometric in the sense of being complex on chord number basis. In the semiclassical JT limit, the commutant becomes the canonical purification of the boundary algebra and claims the no man's island. Comparing with the Hawking radiation process after Page time, the unitary equivalence can be interpreted as the encoding map from the canonical purification to the old Hawking radiation, and thus the no man's island has the same essence as the island. We also show an extension of the boundary algebra to all bounded operators by including an additional exponential wormhole length operator.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the general asymptotically flat, doubly-rotating, three-charge black hole uplifted to a family of NS5-F1-P black brane solutions of Type IIB supergravity. We construct a null-gauged WZW model whose target-space geometry reproduces this background in the NS5 decoupling limit, and show that the gauging parameters precisely satisfy the appropriate consistency conditions on the perturbative string spectrum. Through an analytic continuation and an appropriate limit, this model relates to a recently studied construction describing strings on smooth, horizonless geometries. We further analyze the supersymmetric and extremal three-charge configuration, corresponding to the ten-dimensional uplift of the (NS5-decoupled) BMPV black hole, and show that it requires a novel class of null-gauged WZW models. Our construction provides explicit examples of worldsheet CFTs that capture string dynamics on certain black hole geometries with linear dilaton asymptotics.
