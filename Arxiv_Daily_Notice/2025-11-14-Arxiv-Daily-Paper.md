#### Changing-Look AGN Powered By Disk Tearing

 - **Abstract**
 Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGN) feature order-of-magnitude variability in both the continuum and broad line luminosities on months-to-years long timescales, and are currently unexplained. Simulations have demonstrated that rotating black holes sometimes tear apart tilted accretion disks. These tearing events violently restructure the disk on timescales much shorter than a viscous timescale, hinting at a connection to CLAGN. Here, we show that disk tearing can power changing-look events. We report synthetic observations of an extremely high resolution three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a geometrically thin, tilted accretion disk around a rapidly rotating, $10^8\,M_\odot$ black hole. We perform ray-tracing calculations that follow the disk light to both a line of sight camera and to a distribution of cameras in a prescribed torus-like broad line region. The continuum photoionizes the broad line region and we calculate the resulting spectrum. Both the continuum and line luminosities undergo order of magnitude swings on months-to-years long timescales. We find shorter, weeks long variability driven by the geometric precession of the inner disk and an intraday quasi-periodic oscillation driven by radial breathing of the inner disk. When the torn disk precesses, it causes asymmetric illumination of the broad line region, driving time-evolving red-to-blue asymmetries of the broad emission lines that may be a smoking gun for disk tearing. We also make predictions for future photometric observations from ULTRASAT and Vera Rubin Observatory, both of which may play an important role in detecting future changing-look events.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we introduce the SEEDZ simulations, a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations exploring the formation and growth of the first massive black holes in the Universe. SEEDZ includes models for Population III star formation, supernovae explosions and the resulting formation of light seed black holes, metal enrichment and subsequent Population II star formation, heavy seed black hole formation, Eddington and super-Eddington accretion schemes as well as black hole feedback. In this paper, we cover the overall methodologies employed and present our current results at $z=15$. Our main result so far is that black holes initially grow faster than their host galaxy, and hence over-massive black holes are a feature of the high-redshift Universe. The fundamental black hole-galaxy relationships we observe at $z = 0$ (especially the M$_{\rm BH}$ - M$_*$ relationship) likely only emerge in more mature galaxies. At high-redshift, that relationship has not yet been established. We find that even at these high redshifts, MBHs can grow from their initial heavy seed mass of $\sim$10$^4$ M$_\odot$ up to 10$^6$ M$_\odot$. At the high end of our MBH masses, our simulated galaxy M$_{\rm BH}$ - M$_*$ relations match the observed high redshift trends i.e. over-massive BHs with M$_{\rm BH}$/M$_{\rm star} \sim 10^{-2}$. This initial set of simulations will continue to run down to $z=10$, where we will perform a comprehensive comparison of simulated MBH number densities and M$_{\rm BH}$ - M$_*$ relations with JWST observations. Further simulations with higher resolution will then follow.

#### Chandra and HST Observations of Radio-Selected (Wandering) Massive Black Hole Candidates in Dwarf Galaxies

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09641

 - **Abstract**
 We present Chandra X-ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) follow-up observations of 12 dwarf galaxies from Reines et al. (2020) that are potential hosts of radio-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs), eight of which are non-nuclear and possible ``wandering" black holes (BHs). Our multi-wavelength analysis indicates a heterogeneous sample with five radio sources detected at both X-ray and optical wavelengths within positional uncertainties and non-detections for the remaining objects. Of the radio objects detected in the X-ray/optical, three have multi-wavelength evidence for hosting nuclear massive BHs and one object is consistent with an extreme compact starburst. Only one of the off-nuclear radio sources has a significant optical counterpart and we present Palomar spectroscopy that identifies this object as a background AGN. We cannot definitively determine if the seven remaining off-nuclear radio sources are wandering massive BHs in the target dwarf galaxies or background AGNs, although the three sources with the largest offsets have compact radio cores detected with the Very Large Baseline Array and are consistent with expectations for background AGNs (Sargent et al 2022). Our HST sensitivity limits also allow for wandering massive BHs in the target dwarf galaxies that are hosted by stellar clusters with masses $\lesssim 10^6 M_\odot$.

#### Fractional Dynamics in Galactic Nuclei: Non-Local Transport, Transient Phenomena and the Nullification of the Schwarzschild Barrier
 - **Authors:** Pau Amaro Seoane

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09648

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09648

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate the necessity of fractional calculus for modeling anomalous diffusion in stellar dynamics, specifically Resonant Relaxation (RR) near a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Standard transport theories rely on the local Fokker-Planck (FP) equation, a formalism restricted to Gaussian processes governed by the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). This approach fails for RR, which is a superdiffusive Lévy flight characterized by non-local transport and governed by the Generalized Central Limit Theorem (GCLT). We apply the space-fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE), utilizing non-local Riemann-Liouville operators, to resolve major discrepancies between local theory and observations. In transient regimes, the FFPE predicts an immediate, linear flux ($\Gamma(t) \propto t$), consistent with high Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) rates in post-starburst galaxies, whereas local FP models predict an unphysical exponential delay ($\Gamma(t) \propto \exp(-C/t)$). Furthermore, we prove mathematically that the non-local integral operators permit ``barrier jumping''. This mechanism nullifies transport bottlenecks like the proposed Schwarzschild Barrier (SB). Local models incorrectly interpret the SB as severely suppressing Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) rates. We validate our theoretical findings using direct-summation $N$-body simulations incorporating relativistic corrections. The simulations confirm that particle flux remains continuous across the SB in the regime where RR dominates, demonstrating that the barrier does not inhibit EMRI production. The fractional framework provides the correct physical description for non-local transport, resolving long-standing problems concerning TDE and EMRI rates.

#### Towards a Machine Learning Solution for Hubble Tension: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) Analysis of Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy in Presence of Neutrinos
 - **Authors:** Muhammad Yarahmadi, Amin Salehi

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09706

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09706

 - **Abstract**
 We present a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework for reconstructing the redshift-dependent Hubble parameter \(H(z)\) within the Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (THDE) model extended by massive neutrinos. In this approach, the modified Friedmann equation is incorporated into the neural network loss function, enabling training on Cosmic Chronometers data up to \(z \leq 2\). The framework allows for the simultaneous estimation of the Hubble constant \(H_0\), the neutrino density parameter \(\Omega_\nu\), and the Tsallis non-extensivity index \(\delta\). Uncertainty quantification is performed through dropout simulations, resulting in statistically consistent \(1\sigma\) confidence bands. Our results show that the THDE+$\nu$ model, reconstructed via PINN, alleviates the statistical Hubble tension from the canonical \(\sim 5\sigma\) level down to a range of \(0.5\sigma \leq T \leq 2.2\sigma\), depending on the redshift sampling. Additionally, we constrain the total neutrino mass to \(\Sigma m_\nu < 0.11\,\text{eV}\). A detailed comparison with the traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis demonstrates the consistency of both methods, while highlighting the competitiveness of the PINN-based THDE framework as a robust, data-driven approach for non-parametric cosmological inference within generalized thermodynamics.

#### A precessing magnetic jet as the engine of GRB 250702B
 - **Authors:** Tao An

High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09850

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09850

 - **Abstract**
 GRB 250702B shows ultra long, episodic prompt activity, with three hard gamma ray episodes over about 3.2 h with quasi regular spacing P ~ 2825 s, preceded by a soft X ray flare about one day earlier. We interpret these phenomena with a unified scenario in which a stellar mass black hole accretes from a massive, misaligned debris disk and launches a magnetically dominated, precessing, structured (spine sheath) jet. The engine clock arises from Lense Thirring precession of the outer annulus of a geometrically thick inner torus at radius r ~ 250 to 300 gravitational radii, while the hard spectra reflect magnetic reconnection dissipation in the spine. A slightly off axis viewing geometry resolves the apparent opening angle tension without invoking late energy injection. "Missing" pulses in the second and third cycles occur naturally when low amplitude nutation causes the beaming cone to miss the line of sight. The model yields concrete, falsifiable predictions, providing a self consistent explanation of GRB 250702B radiative and outflow anomalies.

#### GalaxyClusters from the DESILegacy ImagingSurveys. III.Star-forming Fraction of Brightest Cluster Galaxies

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09858

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the evolution of the star-forming fraction ($F_{\mathrm{sf}}$) of Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) at $z<0.8$, using the galaxy clusters identified from the Legacy Imaging Surveys from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Star-forming galaxies are identified using the $g-z$ color, and $F_{\mathrm{sf}}$ is measured as a function of redshift, cluster halo mass, and galaxy stellar mass. Field galaxies are used as a comparison sample to reduce selection effects. For BCGs, $F_{\mathrm{sf}}$ increases with redshift, showing a slow rise below $z \sim 0.4 - 0.5$ and a more rapid increase above this range. In contrast, $F_{\mathrm{sf}}$ decreases with increasing cluster halo mass and BCG stellar mass. At the low stellar mass end, BCGs exhibit higher star-forming fractions than field galaxies, suggesting enhanced star formation likely fueled by cold gas accretion from the intracluster medium. Also, star-forming BCGs tend to show larger projected offsets from the optical cluster density peak than quenching BCGs, indicating ongoing assembly. The analysis of the specific star formation rate (sSFR) further indicates a transition in the dominant mechanism driving star formation in BCGs: cooling flows are likely responsible at low redshift, while gas-rich mergers play a greater role at higher redshift. The shift in dominance occurs around $z \sim 0.5$, aligning with the steep rise in $F_{\mathrm{sf}}$ of BCG.

#### Where Galaxies Point: First Measurement of the Large-Scale Axial Intrinsic Alignment

 - **Abstract**
 Applying a new estimator to the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 weak lensing shape catalog, we map the galaxies' orientation field and report the first detection of a large-scale axial intrinsic alignment (LAIA) on dipolar angular scales. Ellipticals' semi-major axes and spirals' semi-minor axes coherently point toward a common direction, (RA,Dec)=$(306^{+6}_{-4},52^{+3}_{-3})^\circ$ and $(296^{+10}_{-18},50^{+6}_{-2})^\circ$, respectively, with amplitudes in the expected tidal-torquing hierarchy. This pattern could be produced by a horizon-scale tidal field imprinted by primordial inhomogeneities during galaxy assembly and can probe deviations from statistical isotropy. The signal persists across spatial and redshift splits and is difficult to attribute to survey systematics. LAIA offers a new sky-wide compass linking galaxy evolution and cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Warm inflation is a well-motivated and generalized framework of inflation, describing a coupled inflaton-radiation bath. In this work, we investigate a warm inflation model with a quartic potential and a composite dissipation coefficient $\Upsilon(\phi, T) = C_1 \frac{T^3}{M_{\text{Pl}}^2} + C_2 \frac{T^3}{\phi^2}.$ The two terms in $\Upsilon$ dominate at different scales: the first term governs the early inflationary dynamics at large (CMB) scales, while the second term becomes significant at smaller scales. The model features two distinct stages of inflation: an initial phase where strong dissipation ($Q \gg 1$) generates a red-tilted primordial spectrum consistent with CMB observations (from ACT), followed by a second phase producing a blue-tilted spectrum with a significant amplification of power at small scales, leading to primordial black hole formation. We analyze the effects of key parameters -- like the duration of each inflationary phase, the slow-roll parameter at the end of the first phase, the dissipation strength at the pivot scale, and the choice of the growth function -- on the primordial power spectrum and its spectral index. Additionally, we examine the consistency of the model with the swampland distance conjecture and trans-Planckian conjecture, needed for embedding these models with some UV complete theories. This work highlights the potential of warm inflation with a composite dissipation coefficient to reconcile large-scale CMB measurements with small-scale structure formation.

#### Probing AGN Disks Density Profiles through Gravitational Wave Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Massive black holes surrounded by a gaseous disk have been a prevailing model to explain a wide spectrum of astrophysical phenomena related to active galactic nucle (AGNs). However, direct and precise measurements of the disk density profiles remain elusive for current telescopes. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to pinpoint the gas density if an inspiralling stellar mass binary black hole is embedded in the AGN disk. Furthermore, if the barycenter of the pair follows an eccentric orbit around an AGN, then space-borne gravitational wave detectors can measure the density of the surrounding disk with multi-year observations by tracking the gravitational wave evolution. The error between the inferred density profile and the injected truth can be constrained to below $2\times10^{-11}\rm g/cm^3$. Our work opens up an exciting new channel to investigate the very center of galaxies, where disk gas density distributions $\rho(r)$ can be recovered by analyzing time-dependent environmental imprints in gravitational waveforms.

#### Systematic Analysis of Changing-look AGN Variability Using ZTF Light Curves

 - **Abstract**
 Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) are a unique population of AGNs that exhibit the appearance (turn-on) or disappearance (turn-off) of broad emission lines. This study aims to explore the intrinsic mechanisms of CLAGNs by investigating their photometric variability using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which has provided high-cadence observations over the past five years. By visual inspections, we construct a sample of 152 CLAGNs from the literature, all of which show spectral transitions and large optical variability in their ZTF light curves. By analyzing 90 of these CLAGNs and the control samples of Type 1 AGNs, Type 2 AGNs, and extremely variable quasars (EVQs), matched in redshift ($0.2<z<0.8$) and supermassive black hole mass, we compare the color variability, structure function (SF), and variability metric $\sigma_{\mathrm{QSO}}$, which quantifies how closely the light curves resemble a damped random walk (DRW) model. We find that while CLAGNs and EVQs differ from typical Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs in bolometric luminosity and Eddington ratio, the on/off-state CLAGNs share similar variability patterns with the overall CLAGN population, and distinct from EVQ, Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs. This suggests that 'on' and 'off' CLAGNs are not simply equivalent to Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs, respectively. Instead of undergoing genuine transitions between two AGN types, CLAGNs may inhabit a critical state where moderate fluctuations in accretion rate lead to the temporary spectral changes.

#### A Dynamical Scalar Field Model for Dark Energy: Addressing the Hubble Tension and Cosmic Evolution

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10317

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.10317

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a dynamical dark energy model based on a canonical scalar field with a hybrid potential of the form $V(\phi) = V_{0}e^{-\lambda\phi} + V_{1}\phi^{n}$. We constrain the model's 11-dimensional parameter space using a comprehensive combination of cosmological data, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), the Pantheon+ supernova sample, and the matter power spectrum from SDSS. The model provides an excellent fit to the data, with a reduced chi-squared of $\chi^2_{\text{red}} = 0.987$, while successfully alleviating the Hubble constant tension. Our analysis yields a Hubble constant of $H_0 = 70.0$ km/s/Mpc, reducing the discrepancy between early and late-universe measurements. The data favor a negative power-law index of $n \approx -0.92$. A model comparison using the Bayesian Information Criterion finds that the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is still slightly preferred ($\Delta\text{BIC} = 2.178$) due to its fewer parameters. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that this hybrid potential model is a compelling, physically motivated alternative to a cosmological constant.

#### Extending the Frontier of Spatially-Resolved Supermassive Black Hole Mass Measurements to at $1\lesssim z\lesssim2$: Simulations with ELT/MICADO High-Resolution Mass Models and HARMONI Integral-Field Stellar Kinematics

 - **Abstract**
 Current spatially resolved kinematic measurements of supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses are largely confined to the local Universe (distances $\lesssim100$ Mpc). We investigate the potential of the Extremely Large Telescope's (ELT) first-light instruments, MICADO and HARMONI, to extend these dynamical measurements to galaxies at redshift $1\lesssim z\lesssim2$. We select a sample of five bright, massive, quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, adopting their Sérsic profiles from HST photometry as their intrinsic surface brightness distributions. Based on these intrinsic models, we generate mock MICADO images using SimCADO and mock HARMONI integral-field spectroscopic data cubes using HSIM. The HARMONI simulations utilize input stellar kinematics derived from Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM). We then process these mock observations: the simulated MICADO images are fitted with Multi-Gaussian Expansion to derive stellar mass models, and stellar kinematics are extracted from mock HARMONI cubes with pPXF. Finally, these derived stellar mass models and kinematics are used to constrain JAM dynamical models within a Bayesian framework. Our analysis demonstrates that SMBH masses can be recovered with an accuracy of $\sim$10%. We find that MICADO can provide detailed stellar mass models with $\sim$1 hour of on-source exposure. HARMONI requires longer minimum integrations for reliable stellar kinematic measurements of SMBHs. The required on-source time scales with apparent brightness, ranging from 5-7.5 hours for galaxies at $z\approx1$ (F814W, 20-20.5 mag) to 5 hours for galaxies at $1<z\lesssim2$ (F160W, 20.8 mag). These findings highlight the ELT's capability to push the frontier of SMBH mass measurements to $z\approx2$, enabling crucial tests of SMBH-galaxy co-evolution at the top end of the galaxy mass function.

#### Disk warping and black hole X-ray binaries I. Tentative unification of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray binaries exhibit complex variability patterns studied in the power-spectrum. These include the broad-band noise (BBN) components and various types of narrow components called quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). There is currently no consensus about either what determines the presence/absence of the BBN or what generates the QPOs. Many believe the latter is due to frame-dragging effects caused by Lense-Thirring torques. We wish to investigate the potential impact of those frame-dragging effects on the accretion disk itself. In particular, we focus on its impact on the observed variability and the presence (and types) of QPOs associated. We make analytical estimates to assess the potential presence of a geometric warp in the inner accretion disk during state transitions. We show that the presence of a warp can modify the spectral-timing properties in a way that matches the observed transition between QPO types during outbursts. We also discuss the peculiar case of Cyg X-1, as well as how the hard-to-soft transition could be driven by the warp itself. The (expected) emergence of a warp provides a consistent explanation for the evolution of both the BBN and the QPO properties during state transitions. This offers a first path toward unifying the variability of black hole X-ray binary.

 - **Abstract**
 Warm ionized gas is ubiquitous at the centers of X-ray bright elliptical galaxies. While it is believed to play a key role in the feeding and feedback processes of supermassive black holes, its origins remain under debate. Existing studies have primarily focused on the morphology and kinematics of warm ionized gas. This work aims to provide a new perspective on warm (10,000 K) ionized gas and its connection to X-ray-emitting hot gas (>10^6 K) by measuring and comparing their metallicities. We conducted a joint analysis of 13 massive elliptical galaxies using MUSE/VLT and Chandra observations. Emission-line ratios were measured for the warm ionized gas using MUSE observation, and used to infer the ionization mechanisms and derive metallicities of the warm ionized gas using HII, and LIN(E)R calibrations. We also computed the warm phase metallicity using X-ray/EUV, and pAGB stars models. For two sources at higher redshift, direct Te method was also used to measure warm gas metallicities. Our observations reveal that most sources exhibit composite ionization, with contributions from both star formation and LINER-like emission. A positive linear correlation was found between the gas-phase metallicities of the warm and hot phases, ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 Zsun, and suggest the intimate connection between the two gas phases, likely driven by gas cooling and/or mixing. In some sources the warm gas metallicity shows a central drop. A similar radial trend has been reported for the hot gas metallicity in some galaxy clusters. The ionization mechanisms of cooling flow elliptical galaxies are diverse, suggesting multiple channels for powering the warm ionized gas. The large variation in the warm gas metallicity further suggests that cold gas mass derived under the assumption of solar metallicity for the CO-to-H2 conversion factor needs to be revised by approximately an order of magnitude.

#### A new multiprobe analysis of modified gravity and evolving dark energy

 - **Abstract**
 We study the $(w_0, \, w_a)$ parametrization of the dark energy (DE) equation of state, with and without the effective field theory of dark energy (EFTofDE) framework to describe the DE perturbations, parametrized here by the braiding parameter $\alpha_B$ and the running of the Planck mass $\alpha_M$. We combine the EFTofLSS full-shape analysis of the power spectrum and bispectrum of BOSS data with the tomographic angular power spectra $C_\ell^{gg}$, $C_\ell^{\kappa g}$, $C_\ell^{Tg}$ and $C_\ell^{T\kappa}$, where $g$, $\kappa$ and $T$ stand for the DESI luminous red galaxy map, Planck PR4 lensing map and Planck PR4 temperature map, respectively. To analyze these angular power spectra, we go beyond the Limber approximation, allowing us to include large-scales data in $C_\ell^{gg}$. The combination of all these probes with Planck PR4, DESI DR2 BAO and DES Y5 improves the constraint on the 2D posterior distribution of $\{w_0, \, w_a\}$ by $\sim 50 \%$ and increases the preference for evolving dark energy over $\Lambda$ from $3.8 \sigma$ to $4.6 \sigma$. When we remove BAO and supernovae data, we obtain a hint for evolving dark energy at $2.3 \sigma$. Regarding the EFTofDE parameters, we improve the constraints on $\alpha_B$ and $\alpha_M$ by $\sim 40 \%$ and $50 \%$ respectively, finding results compatible with general relativity at $\sim 2 \sigma$. We show that these constraints do not depend on the choice of the BAO and supernovae likelihoods.

 - **Abstract**
 Previous studies have examined the holographic principle as a means of producing dark energy. Here we propose instead the possibility of holographic dark matter. In this case, dark matter does not arise in the framework of particle physics but is derived from the infrared cutoff set by the horizon scale. Using the Ricci cutoff, and a universe containing only baryons and radiation, we can account for the dark matter and naturally explain the coincidence between baryonic and nonbaryonic contributions to the density. In the presence of a pre-existing vacuum energy density our model reverses the sign of this density, thus accounting for the fact that certain string theories generically predict a negative vacuum energy, but observations require a positive value.

 We present a cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing power spectrum analysis using daytime data (11am-11pm UTC) gathered by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) over the period 2017-2022 (ACT Data Release 6). This dataset is challenging to analyze because the Sun heats and deforms the telescope mirror, complicating the characterization of the telescope. We perform more than one hundred null and consistency checks to ensure the robustness of our measurement and its compatibility with nighttime observations. We detect the CMB lensing power spectrum at 17$\sigma$ significance, with an amplitude $A_\textrm{lens} = 1.045 \pm 0.063$ with respect to the prediction from the best-fit Planck-ACT CMB power spectrum $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In combination with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, this corresponds to a constraint on the amplitude of matter fluctuations $\sigma_8 = 0.826 \pm 0.027$. The analysis presented here is especially relevant for ground-based millimeter-wave CMB experiments, paving the way for future analyses making use of both nighttime and daytime data to place tight constraints on cosmological parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The DESI collaboration reports a significant preference for a dynamic dark energy model ($w_0w_a$CDM) over the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM) when their data are combined with other frontier cosmological probes. We present a direct Bayesian model comparison using nested sampling to compute the Bayesian evidence, revealing a contrasting conclusion: for the key combination of the DESI DR2 BAO and the Planck CMB data, we find the Bayesian evidence modestly favours $\Lambda$CDM (log-Bayes factor $\ln B = -0.57{\scriptstyle\pm0.26}$), in contrast to the collaboration's 3.1$\sigma$ frequentist significance in favoring $w_0w_a$CDM. Extending this analysis to also combine with the DES-Y5 supernova catalogue, our Bayesian analysis reaches a significance of $3.07{\scriptstyle\pm0.10}\,\sigma$ in favour of $w_0w_a$CDM. By performing a comprehensive tension analysis, employing five complementary metrics, we pinpoint the origin: a significant ($\approx 2.95\sigma$), low-dimensional tension between DESI DR2 and DES-Y5 that is present only within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. The $w_0w_a$CDM model is preferred precisely because its additional parameters act to resolve this specific dataset conflict. The convergence of our findings with independent geometric analyses suggests that the preference for dynamic dark energy is primarily driven by the resolution of inter-dataset tensions, warranting a cautious interpretation of its statistical significance.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves from comparable-mass binary-black-hole mergers are often described in terms of three stages: inspiral, merger and ringdown. Post-Newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories are used to model the inspiral and ringdown parts of the waveform, respectively, while the merger phase has been modeled most accurately using numerical relativity (NR). Nevertheless, there have been several approaches used to model the merger phase using analytical methods. In this paper, we adapt a hybrid approximation method that applies post-Newtonian and black-hole perturbation theories at the same times in different spatial regions of a binary-black-hole waveform (and which are matched at a boundary region with prescribed dynamics). Prior work with the hybrid method used leading post-Newtonian theory and the perturbation theory of nonrotating black holes, which led to errors during the late inspiral and disagreement with the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency extracted from NR simulations during the ringdown. To obtain a better match with NR waveforms of binary-black-hole mergers, we made several phenomenological modifications to the hybrid method. Specifically, to better capture the inspiral dynamics, we use the effective-one-body method for modeling the trajectory of the boundary between the two spatial regions. The waveform is determined by evolving a Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli-type equation for an effective black-hole perturbation theory problem with a modified Poschl-Teller potential. By tuning the potential to match the dominant quasinormal-mode frequency of the remnant black hole and also optimizing the boundary data on the matching region, we could match NR waveforms from nonspinning, comparable-mass binary black holes with mass ratios between one and eight, with a relative error of order $10^{-3}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong evidence for an isotropic, Gaussian gravitational wave background (GWB) has been found by multiple pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The GWB is expected to be sourced by a finite population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) emitting in the PTA sensitivity band, and astrophysical inference of PTA data sets suggests a GWB signal that is at the higher end of GWB spectral amplitude estimates. However, current inference analyses make simplifying assumptions, such as modeling the GWB as Gaussian, assuming that all SMBHBs only emit at frequencies that are integer multiples of the total observing time, and ignoring the interference between the signals of different SMBHBs. In this paper, we build analytical and numerical models of an astrophysical GWB without the above approximations, and compare the statistical properties of its induced PTA signal to those of a signal produced by a Gaussian GWB. We show that interference effects introduce non-Gaussianities in the PTA signal, which are currently unmodeled in PTA analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes in four-dimensional, asymptotically flat general relativity have vanishing static tidal Love numbers (TLNs), a property tied to a hidden symmetry of the perturbation equations. Within the Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) parametrization, a subclass of spacetimes was previously shown to admit such Ladder symmetry, which enforces the absence of static scalar TLNs. In this work, we introduce parametric deformations to such Ladder-symmetric spacetimes and analyze the resultant linear tidal response. Using the parametrized formalism for TLNs, we show that any deviation from a Ladder-symmetric background leads to non-zero static scalar TLNs. This establishes Ladder symmetry as a necessary, as well as sufficient condition, for the vanishing of static TLNs in static, spherically symmetric black holes and in rotating black holes of the KRZ class.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the dynamics of periodic orbits and the properties of accretion disks around a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) immersed in a King-type dark matter (DM) halo. Our analysis focuses on how the presence of the King DM halo influences both the behavior of periodic orbits and the radiative characteristics of the accretion disk. We begin by examining time-like periodic geodesic orbits for various configurations characterized by different energy and angular momentum values, represented by the integers $(z, w, v)$. Furthermore, we explore the effects of the King DM halo on time-like periodic geodesics, marginally bound orbits, and innermost stable circular orbits, thereby providing a deeper understanding of how the DM halo environment modifies the behavior of these stable orbits and timelike particle geodesics. Finally, we analyze the null geodesics and the accretion disk properties by studying their direct and secondary images, redshift distributions, and radiation fluxes as observed at infinity for a range of inclination angles. This approach allows us to gain valuable insights into the spacetime geometry of a Schwarzschild-like BH within the King-type DM halo, its physical and radiative properties in the accretion disk, and the corresponding observational implications.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a class of horizonless solutions in Einstein-Weyl gravity, corresponding to the so-called attractive naked singularities of the (-2,2) type. In contrast to General Relativity, where naked singularities are generically unstable and excluded by the cosmic censorship conjecture, we show that these configurations are linearly stable under tensor perturbations. By numerically evolving the perturbation equations in the time domain, we find that all modes decay with characteristic oscillatory tails, a behavior consistent with the dynamics of massive field perturbations in quadratic gravity. This establishes that attractive naked singularities in Einstein-Weyl gravity are dynamically stable and can persist as stationary configurations. We argue that these horizonless configurations are observationally concealed, and therefore we refer to them as veiled singularities. Their stability and phenomenological similarity to black holes suggest that they may represent viable horizonless alternatives in higher-derivative theories of gravity, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between singularity resolution, stability, and effective field dynamics beyond Einstein's theory.

 - **Abstract**
 The asymptotic nature of unbound binary-black-hole encounters provides a clean method for comparing different approaches for modeling the two-body problem in general relativity. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations of black-hole scattering, generated using the Spectral Einstein Code, to explore the self-force and post-Minkowskian expansions of the scattering angle. First, we use a set of unequal-mass simulations to extract the self-force contributions to the scattering angle. Our main result is that using information up to second-order in the symmetric mass ratio (2SF) reproduces numerical relativity within the error bars across the full range of mass-ratios, including equal mass. Next, we compare our numerical relativity results to state-of-the-art post-Minkowskian predictions at larger impact parameters than previously explored. We find good agreement in the weak-field regime and discuss the relative importance of higher-order terms.

#### Confronting dark energy in Harada's Conformal Killing Gravity with observational data

 - **Abstract**
 Based on a comprehensive analysis of recent observational data-a combination of DESI DR1, Planck CMB, and Pantheon+ SN Ia-this study critically evaluates the two dark energy (DE) proposals within Harada's Conformal Killing Gravity (CKG) model. The model in question predicts either a dominant phantom-type effective DE component with EoS $\omega = -5/3$ or a hybrid scenario combining a cosmological constant ($\omega = -1$) with a subdominant $\omega = -5/3$ fluid (around $5\%$) to address the Hubble tension (HT) and late-time acceleration. An analysis based on the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) demonstrates that the pure CKG fluid scenario $\omega = -5/3$ is excluded, whereas the hybrid model remains only marginally compatible. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis constrains the effective DE density parameter to $\Omega_{\text{eff}} = 0.009^{+0.006}_{-0.007}$ ($68\%$ CL), consistent with zero and ruling out the around $5\%$ contribution required by Harada's CKG. The resulting Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ and effective EoS $\omega_{\text{eff}}(z)$ are indistinguishable from those of $\Lambda$CDM. Bayesian model comparison via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) shows no statistical preference for CKG over $\Lambda$CDM ($\Delta \text{AIC} = +2.6$), disfavoring the additional complexity of the CKG model. The key output of this study is that both DE proposals in Harada's CKG are ruled out by current cosmological data, and HT remains unresolved.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the bound states of a massive scalar field around a topological star, and show that these are strictly normal modes. This yields a genuine gravitational atom, sharply distinguishing horizonless objects from black holes. It is shown that the modes are controlled by the field's Compton wavelength compared to the size of the star. When the Compton wavelength is large, the field forms a cloud with a hydrogen-like spectrum, while in the opposite regime it localizes along timelike trajectories. When the two scales are comparable the spectrum becomes richer, and we characterize it in detail allowing the field to carry electric charge and Kaluza--Klein momentum.

 - **Abstract**
 The physical and mathematical properties of the composed Reissner-Nordström-black-hole-massive-scalar-field system are studied {\it analytically} in the dimensionless large-mass $M\mu\gg1$ regime [here $\{M,\mu\}$ are respectively the mass of the central black hole and the proper mass of the scalar field]. It is proved that, for a given value ${\bar Q}\equiv Q/M$ of the dimensionless charge parameter of the central black hole, the system is characterized by the presence of quasi-resonances, linearized perturbation modes with arbitrarily long lifetimes. In particular, using analytical techniques, we determine the black-hole-field critical mass spectrum $\{M\mu_{\text{crit}}({\bar Q})\}$ which characterizes the long-lived resonances of the composed physical system.

 - **Abstract**
 Interrelationships between the expansion, the shear, and the vorticity -- the kinematical tensors -- on the one hand, and the polarization modes of gravitational waves on the other hand, are studied by considering freely falling test particles. After studying exact relations, we consider slowly moving particles under the influence of a weak gravitational field. Linearized plane waves of metric theories of gravity representative of those determined by a general second order Lagrangian, including General Relativity, are shown to exemplify the following interconnections: between the transverse components of the shear and the transverse tensor polarization mode; between the expansion, and both the transverse scalar and the longitudinal polarization modes; and between the longitudinal-transverse components of the shear and the vorticity, and the vector polarization mode.

 - **Abstract**
 A sharp signature of the black hole singularity in holography is a divergence in the boundary thermal two-point function at a specific point in the complex time plane. This divergence arises from a null geodesic that bounces off the black hole singularity. At finite 't Hooft coupling, stringy corrections to the bulk dynamics cannot be neglected, and the fate of the bouncing geodesic is an open question. We propose a simple scenario in which the singularity in the two-point function is shifted slightly into the complex plane, thereby smoothing it out into a finite-size bump. We demonstrate this smoothing explicitly in a microscopic example, namely the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at infinite temperature, where the correlator is under analytic control. Our result suggests a bulk description of planar theories at finite coupling as stringy black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the microscopic origin of de Sitter entropy using a Lorentzian path-integral approach. We construct a Hilbert space whose states are associated with configurations of thin shells or end-of-the-world branes, with state overlaps defined by the gravitational path integral. By considering states which are indistinguishable to an observer, we find that the variance of microstate overlaps is dominated by Lorentzian wormhole topologies with conical singularities. Evaluating these overlaps, we recover the expected area law for the entropy, relating the dimension of the de Sitter Hilbert space to the area of the cosmological horizon. Extending this analysis to Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime, we show that both the cosmological and black hole horizons contribute to the total entropy. Along the way, we present an explicit construction of the shell and brane configurations and examine their compatibility with relevant consistency conditions, including the null energy condition.

 - **Abstract**
 The analytic structure of holographic correlation functions at finite temperature contains information about curvature singularities of black holes in AdS. We compute the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients of the holographic two-point function of scalar operators at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. We show that the stress-tensor and current (T+J) sector of the OPE contains a singularity in the complex time plane at a location that can be identified with the time-shift of a bouncing geodesic in the charged black hole geometry: The geodesic starts at a boundary of a charged black hole in AdS, bounces off the timelike singularity, before returning to a different asymptotic boundary on the same side of the Penrose diagram. We show that the singularity in the T+J sector is smooth across the point where black hole becomes extremal, indicating that the analytic properties of holographic correlators could potentially probe naked singularities.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the full spectrum of tidal Love numbers for Reissner-Nordström (RN) black holes in general spacetime dimensions. By perturbing the Einstein-Maxwell theory around the $D$-dimensional RN background, we derive an effective two dimensional quadratic action encompassing tensor, vector, and scalar-type perturbation sectors. Through diagonalization, we obtain master equations governing each sector and extract the corresponding Love numbers from the asymptotic behavior of the solutions. Our results confirm that all Love numbers vanish for four-dimensional RN black holes. In higher dimensions, the tensor and vector Love numbers reproduce previously known results. For the previously unknown scalar-type Love numbers, we show also they vanish for integer valued effective multipolar indices and display logarithmic running behavior when the corresponding indices are half integers.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a conceptual parallel between the black hole information problem and Zeno's paradox, highlighting the role of limiting procedures that turn formally infinite constructions into finite physical observables. Building on the replica--wormhole paradigm, we move beyond unitarity restoration to formulate a quantitative notion of irreversibility in Hawking radiation. Our main result is a modular thermodynamic framework for black-hole evaporation, in which modular entropy, entanglement capacity, and relative entropy assume thermodynamic roles. The monotonicity of relative entropy furnishes a generalized second law that determines the arrow of evolution in replica space. We further resolve the apparent tension between the replica method and the quantum no-cloning theorem by interpreting replicas as ensemble representations rather than physical copies of an unknown state, thereby clarifying the operational meaning of gravitational path integrals. A key message of this work is that non-additivity in Tsallis statistics provides an information-theoretic analogue of the correlations induced by replica wormholes.

 - **Abstract**
 Lee-Yang zero theory plays a crucial role in phase transition theory and is widely employed in the critical behavior of statistical thermodynamics. The supercritical regime of black hole thermodynamics remains a relatively unexplored area, and recent applications of this theory to charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes have initiated probes into this regime, revealing a simple structure partitioned by a single Widom line. In this paper, we apply Lee-Yang theory to charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes, which feature complex phase diagrams (e.g., triple points), to determine how such structures are reflected in the supercritical regime. Notably, we observe a key dimensional difference in that the five-dimensional (5d) system, which lacks a triple point, confirms the known single Widom line structure, while the six-dimensional (6d) system, which admits a triple point, generates two distinct Widom lines. These lines partition the supercritical domain into three sectors (small-, intermediate-, and large- black hole-like phases), corresponding to the three phases coexisting at the triple point. Our results reveal a direct correspondence between the number of coexisting phases at a triple point and the number of distinct supercritical sectors separated by Widom lines.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a mechanism for generating mass terms in the IKKT and BFSS matrix theories through compactification on a torus and the derivation of a zero-mode effective theory, emphasising the crucial role of fermionic boundary conditions. Extending a recent proposal developed for the IKKT model to the BFSS framework, we explore a broader class of mixed fermionic boundary conditions in both theories. This choice leads to a distinct effective theory with intermediate features, where a mass term is generated together with fermionic zero modes. In the BFSS case, this setup further allows for the construction of black hole solutions. The resulting geometry takes the form of a fuzzy sphere, with quantum excitations in the fermionic sector accounting for the corresponding black hole entropy.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the fate of asymptotic simplicity in physically relevant settings of compact-object scattering. Using the stress tensor of a two-body system as a source, we compute the spacetime metric in General Relativity at finite observer distance in an asymptotic expansion. To do so, we relate the metric to the final-state graviton one-point function in momentum space, which is computed using perturbative QFT techniques. Both the simple pole and the infrared-related logarithmic branch cut in the virtuality of the external graviton contribute nontrivially. We focus on determining the fall-off behavior of the Newman-Penrose scalars, confirming previous predictions that Sachs's peeling property is violated at leading order in the post-Minkowski expansion. Our analysis at higher orders in the post-Minkowskian expansion reveals a significantly stronger breakdown of the peeling property than previously recognized, which is the result of nonlinear, long-range interactions between localized sources and the surrounding gravitational field.
