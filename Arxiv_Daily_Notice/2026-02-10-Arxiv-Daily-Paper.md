#### A NICER view of the corona through time-dependent Comptonization of the quasi-periodic oscillations in nine black-hole X-ray binaries

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic study of the evolution of the corona geometry in nine black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) using archival data from NICER. We identify 171 observations exhibiting quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) across various spectral states and model the time-averaged energy spectra of the source, as well as the energy-dependent rms and phase-lag spectra of the QPO, with the time-dependent Comptonization model vKompthdk. This allows us to simultaneously constrain the corona size and feedback fraction during outbursts. By using the power color hue diagnostics, we identify different spectral states, and observe that the QPO frequency increases from $\sim$0.1 Hz to $\sim$10 Hz in the low-hard and hard-intermediate states (LHS and HIMS), and remains approximately constant at 4--5~Hz in the soft-intermediate state (SIMS). The corona size shows significant evolution: the corona is large ($\sim10^4$--$10^5$ km) in the LHS, contracts rapidly to $\sim10^3$ km in the HIMS, and exhibits a flare-like expansion near the HIMS-to-SIMS transition. In the SIMS and high-soft state (HSS), the corona becomes compact and stable (4000--8000~km). The feedback fraction of the corona photons increases during the periods in which the corona contracts and decreases during the periods in which the corona expands, indicating a change of the disk-corona coupling. Our results are consistent with previous QPO-based studies using vKompthdk on some individual sources. This work, however, provides the first view of the coronal evolution across outbursts for a diverse BHXRB sample, offering critical insights into coronal behavior as a function of the spectral state of the source.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we present a newly developed GRPIC code framework called FPIC, providing a detailed description of the Maxwell-equations solver, of the particle ``pushers'', and of the other algorithms that are needed in this approach. We describe in detail the code, which is written in Fortran and exploits parallel architectures using MPI directives both for the fields and particles. FPIC adopts spherical Kerr-Schild coordinates, which encode the overall spherical topology of the problem while remaining regular at the event horizon. The Maxwell equations are evolved using a finite-difference time-domain solver with a leapfrog scheme, while multiple particle ``pushers'' are implemented for the evolution of the particles. In addition to well-known algorithms, we introduce a novel hybrid method that dynamically switches between the most appropriate scheme based on the violation of the Hamiltonian energy. We first present results for neutral particles orbiting around black holes, both in the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, monitoring the evolution of the Hamiltonian error across different integration schemes. We apply our hybrid approach, showing that it is capable of achieving improved energy conservation at reduced computational cost. We apply FPIC to investigate the Wald solution, first in electrovacuum and subsequently in plasma-filled configurations. In the latter case, particles with negative energy at infinity are present inside the ergosphere, indicating that the Penrose process is active. Finally, we present the split-monopole solution in a plasma-filled environment and successfully reproduce the Blandford-Znajek luminosity, finding very good agreement with analytical predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how and when the first stars and galaxies formed remains one of the central challenges in modern cosmology. These structures emerged during the transition from the Dark Ages to the Cosmic Dawn, a period that remains observationally unconstrained despite strong theoretical progress. During this epoch, neutral hydrogen absorbed a fraction of cosmic microwave background photons through its 21-cm hyperfine transition, producing a 21-cm absorption signal whose evolution encodes the early Universe's thermal and ionization history. However, extracting the underlying astrophysical parameters from this signal is limited by severe parameter degeneracies, which cannot be resolved without independent observational probes. The next-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as Cosmic Explorer (CE), will observe binary black hole (BBH) mergers up to very large redshifts and hence will detect a fraction of them formed within the redshift range $\sim 13-25$. The merger rate of these BBHs will depend on the star formation rate density (SFRD) at these redshifts, together with the BBH formation efficiency and a time delay distribution. Therefore, the merger rate of these BBHs can work as a tracer of the SFRD in the redshift range $\sim 13-25$. In this Letter, we establish a novel multi-messenger framework and present a proof-of-principle concept of how the observations of BBH mergers form next-generation GW detectors can improve the inference of parameters generating the 21-cm cosmic hydrogen signal, and help break degeneracies between them.

#### Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves and Primordial Black Holes from a Localized Bump or Dip Feature in a Single-Field Inflationary Potential

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.07951

 - **Abstract**
 We study the production of scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes in a single-field inflation model with a localized bump or dip feature in the potential. Introducing such a localized feature temporarily decelerates the slow-roll inflaton, amplifying the primordial curvature power spectrum into a sharp peak. Consequently, this enhancement sources a significant stochastic background of gravitational waves and leads to abundant formation of primordial black holes. Through eight benchmark cases, we show that the predicted abundances of primordial black holes can remain compatible with current observational limits, while the corresponding gravitational wave spectra peaking across a wide range of frequencies are accessible to future gravitational wave experiments in multiple observational bands.

#### Dark Matter from Eternity

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.08338

 - **Abstract**
 We propose that the totality of dark matter in the universe might ascribe its origin to one of the key properties of cosmological inflation, that it may be eternal: regions that at the end of the primordial accelerated expansion of the universe never reheated, but keep eternally inflating, manifest themselves as primordial black holes in our observable universe. This mechanism can provide a primordial black hole abundance which is larger than the standard one due to the gravitational collapse of sizeable overdensities in the radiation phase. It also predicts a broad spectrum for the curvature perturbation and a flat stochastic gravitational wave background at a level of $\Omega_\text{GW} h^2 \simeq 10^{-10}$ up to the mHz.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-wavelength study of nuclear outflows in the nearby dwarf Seyfert galaxy NGC~4395, which hosts an intermediate-mass black hole. Using \textit{JWST}/NIRSpec and MIRI IFU spectroscopy (1.66--28.6~$\mu$m), together with ALMA and Gemini/GMOS data, we probe the ionised and molecular gas on parsec scales. The JWST nuclear spectra reveal 134 emission lines, including H\,\textsc{i}, He, numerous fine-structure lines, H$_2$ rotational/ro-vibrational transitions, and several PAH bands. Modelling of the H$_2$ rotational lines reveals three warm/hot molecular components ($T\!\approx\!580$, 1480, and 2900~K), along with a cold ($<50$~K) phase traced by ALMA CO(2--1). Outflow signatures are detected in cold and warm/hot molecular gas, in H\,\textsc{i}, and in 36 fine-structure lines spanning ionisation potentials of 7.6--300~eV. Ionised outflow velocities range from 127 to 716~km\,s$^{-1}$, with blueshifted and redshifted components consistent with a stratified biconical geometry. The cold molecular gas shows a mass outflow rate nearly 1--2 orders of magnitude larger than that of the warm/hot molecular and ionised phases. The kinetic coupling efficiency is 0.003--0.12\% for the coronal-line gas and 0.4--1.4\% for the H\,\textsc{i} outflow, indicating that only the low-ionisation gas significantly impacts the surrounding ISM. Outflow velocity and the fraction of flux in the outflowing component increase with ionisation potential, implying that the most highly ionised gas originates closest to the AGN and is most efficiently accelerated.

 - **Abstract**
 Identifying the host galaxy of a binary black hole (BBH) merger detected via gravitational waves (GWs) remains a challenge due to the absence of electromagnetic counterparts and the large localization volumes produced by current-generation detectors. A confident host association would provide stellar population properties to constrain BBH formation channels and enable measurements of cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant, H0. We simulate BBH mergers in nearby (z<0.25) host galaxies to evaluate the feasibility of host identification with future GW detector networks, including configurations with the planned LIGO-India detector and third-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). We construct two injection grids to explore variations in BBH mass, distance, and directional sensitivity, and infer localization volumes using the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-based parameter estimation implemented through BILBY. To assess the prospects for unique host identification, we introduce a set of diagnostics: theoretical comoving volume thresholds for galaxies of a given stellar mass, derived from galaxy stellar mass functions, a metallicity-based volume threshold motivated by progenitor environment models, stellar mass fractions to quantify candidate host prominence, and the probability of chance alignment (p_c). These metrics provide ways to evaluate host associations and constrain BBH formation channels. We find that future networks that include ET and CE localize BBH mergers to volumes smaller than those theoretical thresholds, implying potentially unique host identification, out to ~1000 Mpc at a rate of ~100 yr^{-1}. While associations for individual events may remain uncertain, our framework is well-suited to population-level analyses, enabling constraints on BBH formation scenarios in the era of next-generation GW detector networks.

 - **Abstract**
 We study tidal disruption events (TDEs) and compact object inspirals in nuclear star clusters (NSCs) hosting a central supermassive black hole (SMBH), focusing on their role in SMBH growth. Using the STARDISK version of the direct N-body code NBODY6++GPU, we perform pilot simulations with two improved models: one for mass fallback from TDEs and another for compact object plunges based on orbital decay timescales. Our results show that mass accretion via TDEs peaks within the first 2 Myr and decreases more rapidly for higher initial SMBH masses, with roughly half the disrupted stellar debris being accreted. Compact object accretion is confined mostly to orbits with pericenters between 4 and 27 Schwarzschild radii and is suppressed by an order of magnitude when inspiral criteria are applied.

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole X-ray binary 4U 1755$-$338 underwent an outburst in 2020 after 25 years of quiescence. The comprehensive spectral analysis revealed that the system has a low interstellar neutral hydrogen column density of $0.34\pm0.01 \times$10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. The outburst began with a low mass-accretion rate and was characterized as a low-luminosity outburst. The radius of the inner accretion disc remained constant throughout the outburst. Additionally, a growing neutral medium with constant density was detected in the local environment of 4U 1755$-$this http URL hardness-intensity diagram (HID) did not follow the standard q-shaped pattern, indicating a non-canonical outburst. Instead, the HID showed a correlated evolution of hardness and source flux, suggesting a thermal disc origin of the flux. A wideband spectral analysis was performed using simultaneous NICER-NuSTAR data in two frameworks, based on kerrbb and bhspec. The results of bhspec (kerrbb) based modeling indicate that 4U 1755$-$338 is a high-inclination system, $67.44_{-3.03}^{+9.75}$ ($75.25_{-4.68}^{+5.59}$) degrees, and harbors a moderately spinning black hole with a spin parameter of $0.78_{-0.14}^{+0.02}$ ($0.50_{-0.43}^{+0.19}$) and a mass of $3.37_{-1.04}^{+0.45} (3.28_{-1.1}^{+1.7})M_{\odot}$ respectively. The inferred key parameters: black hole mass, spin, and system inclination are consistent across both modeling approaches. No reflection features were detected in the spectra of 4U 1755$-$338. The high spectral index, the blackbody nature ($L\propto T^4$) of the hardness ratio, the absence of reflection signatures, and the weak variability in the power density spectra indicate that the source remained in the high/soft state throughout the outburst.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore, using a state-of-the-art simulation code in 3D and to late enough times to witness final observables, the dependence of core-collapse supernova explosions on the nuclear equation of state. Going beyond questions of explodability, we compare final explosion energies, nucleosynthetic yields, recoil kicks, and gravitational-wave and neutrino signatures using the SFHo and DD2 nuclear equations of state (EOS) for a 9-$M_{\odot}$/solar-metallicity progenitor star. The DD2 EOS is stiffer and has a lower effective nucleon mass. The result is a more extended protoneutron star (PNS) and lower central densities. As a consequence, the mean neutrino energies, final explosion energy, and recoil kick speed are lower. Moreover, the evolution of PNS convection differs between the two EOS models in significant ways. This translates in part into interestingly altered neutrino ``light" curves and noticeably altered gravitational-wave signal strengths and frequency characteristics that may be diagnostic. The faster exploding model (SFHo) yields slightly more neutron-rich ejecta and more species with atomic weights between 60 and 90 and a weak r-process. However, this is merely a preliminary study. The next step is a more comprehensive and multi-progenitor set of 3D supernova simulations for various EOSes to late times when the observables have asymptoted. Such a future investigation will have a direct bearing on the neutron star and black hole birth mass functions and the quest towards a fully quantitative theory of supernova observables.

 - **Abstract**
 A general relativistic model of an astrophysical hypermassive extremely magnetized ultra-compact self-bound quark--gluon plasma object that is supported against its ultimate gravitational implosion by the simultaneous action of the vacuum polarization driven by nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED: light-by-light scattering) and the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) asymptotic freedom, is presented. These QCD stars can be the final figures of the equilibrium of collapsing stellar cores. Post-supernova fallback material pushes the nascent remnant beyond its stability to collapse into a hybrid hypermassive neutron star (HHMNS). Hypercritical accretion can unbind the whole HHMNS's baryons to spontaneously break away color confinement, powering a first-order hadron-to-quark phase transition to a sea of ever-freer quarks and gluons. This core is hydro-stabilized by the steady, endlessly compression-admitting asymptotic freedom state, possibly via gluon-mediated enduring exchange of color charge among bound states. The nonlinear TOV equation indicates the occurrence of hypermassive QGP/QCD stars with a wide mass spectrum ($0\lesssim$ M$^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}}\lesssim$\,7\,M$_\odot$ and beyond), for star radii ($0\lesssim R^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}}\lesssim 24$\,km and beyond) with B-fields ($10^{14} \leq$ B$^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}} \leq 10^{16}$\,G and beyond). Such QCD stars can emulate what the true black holes are supposed to gravitationally do in most astrophysical settings. This color quark star could be found through a search for its eternal ``yo-yo'' state gravitational-wave emission, or via lensing phenomena like gravitational rainbows, as in this scenario it is expected that the light deflection angle, directly influenced by the larger effective mass/radius and magnetic field of the deflecting object, increases as the incidence angle decreases for impact parameter lower values.

 - **Abstract**
 The complete evaporation of black holes, as a natural endpoint of Hawking radiation, gives rise to the black hole information paradox, which fundamentally challenges the principles of unitarity and information conservation in quantum mechanics. Although the AdS/CFT correspondence indicates that information is preserved during black hole evaporation, the precise mechanism by which it is recovered from the Hawking radiation remains an open question. To explore a potential resolution, we investigate information transfer in an analog black hole spacetime realized through position-dependent coupling in an XY spin chain. We derive and demonstrate Page curve-like behavior, and analyze the transmission of quantum resources, such as entanglement and coherence, across the effective horizon. Our results show that quantum resources initially localized within an interior subsystem can be transferred to the exterior via particle radiation through the horizon. This study provides a novel perspective from quantum simulation on how information may escape from black holes, thereby contributing to the further understanding of the black hole information paradox.

#### On the Gravitational Energy of Axial Perturbations in Regular Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 The article deals with the gravitational energy associated with axial perturbations of regular black holes. We review the stability of the geometry under odd-parity perturbations and the corresponding quasinormal modes, previously obtained for this class of spacetimes. The perturbative functions describing the metric fluctuations are reconstructed from the master equation. To evaluate the energy content of these perturbations, we employ the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR), which provides a well-defined expression for gravitational energy. The gravitational energy is computed up to second order in the perturbation parameter and expressed in terms of the quasinormal mode functions. Our results establish a direct connection between the dynamical response of regular black holes and the energy carried by their gravitational perturbations.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) around a rotating Hayward black hole to assess the detectability of signatures arising from quantum this http URL quantum parameter $\alpha_0$, which encodes deviations from general relativity (GR), introduces extra correction terms in both the orbital frequency and the fluxes. Our results show that after one year of accumulated observation, these corrections induce a detectable dephasing in the EMRI waveform. Using the modified orbital evolution driven by $\alpha_0$, we generate waveforms via the augmented analytic kludge (AAK) model implemented in the \texttt{FastEMRIWaveforms} package. Furthermore, we utilize the time-delay interferometry (TDI) to suppress the laser noise and phase fluctuations induced by spacecraft motion, and then employ the Fisher information matrix (FIM) to test the sensitivity of LISA in detecting deviations from GR. Our results demonstrate the potential of LISA to probe quantum-gravity effects through high-precision observations of EMRIs.

#### Existence of Halos Outside Schwarzschild-$f(R)$ Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the possibility of photon halos (stable photon orbits) forming outside Schwarzschild-$f(R)$ black holes by analyzing null geodesics in these spacetimes. Using methods inspired by studies of spherical photon orbits around Kerr-Newman black holes, we derive conditions for the existence of such halos. We examine several f(R) gravity models, including quadratic, logarithmic, exponential, cubic, power-law, and hyperbolic forms, and find that multiple photon orbits -- both stable and unstable -- can appear outside the event horizon for certain parameter ranges. These additional orbits (halos) provide new insights into spacetime geometry and potential observational signatures of black holes in modified gravity. We present analytical expressions for the orbital radii, perform a numerical stability analysis, and discuss possible observational implications for black hole shadows. Our results indicate that while the standard Schwarzschild black hole admits only a single unstable light ring, Schwarzschild-$f(R)$ black holes can support an additional outer stable photon orbit (a halo) without triggering a black-hole bomb instability. This work deepens the understanding of photon-orbit structures in alternative theories of gravity and highlights how such effects could be detected through deviations in black hole shadow size or morphology.

 - **Abstract**
 Interpreting horizon-scale black hole images currently relies on computationally intensive General Relativistic Ray Tracing (GRRT) simulations, which pose a significant bottleneck for rapid parameter exploration and high-precision tests of strong-field gravity. We demonstrate that physically accurate black hole images, synthesized from magnetized accretion flows, inherently reside on a low-dimensional manifold-encoding the essential features of spacetime geometry, plasma distribution, and relativistic emission. Leveraging this structure, we introduce a physics-conditioned diffusion model that operates in a compact latent space to generate high-fidelity black hole imagery directly from physical parameters. The model accurately reproduces critical observational signatures from full GRRT simulations-such as shadow diameter, photon-ring structure, and relativistic brightness asymmetry-while achieving over a fourfold reduction in computational expense. Compared with the previous generation of denoising diffusion models, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in image quality, reconstruction fidelity, and parameter estimation accuracy, while reducing the average inference time per black hole image from 5.25 seconds to 1.15 seconds. Our work establishes diffusion-based latent models as efficient and scalable substitutes for traditional radiative transfer solvers, offering a practical framework toward real-time modeling and inference for next-generation black hole imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the optical properties of a spherically symmetric Mod(A)Max black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter, focusing on key features such as the photon sphere radius, shadow, photon trajectories, and the effective radial force experienced by photons. We also study the dynamics of massive particles around the black hole, deriving the effective potential and, from it, the specific energy and angular momentum of particles moving in circular orbits of fixed radii is discussed. The conditions for marginally stable circular orbits are analyzed, highlighting how the geometric parameters that modify the spacetime curvature influence both the optical and dynamical features. Furthermore, we explore the thermodynamic behavior of the black hole by examining its temperature, Gibbs free energy, and heat capacity, as well as its thermodynamic topology. Finally, scalar field perturbations are considered through the massless Klein-Gordon equation, and the quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the eikonal regime are computed, illustrating how the geometric parameters affect the potential and the QNM spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 With the success of static black-hole imaging, the next frontier is the dynamic and 3D imaging of black holes. Recovering the dynamic 3D gas near a black hole would reveal previously-unseen parts of the universe and inform new physics models. However, only sparse radio measurements from a single viewpoint are possible, making the dynamic 3D reconstruction problem significantly ill-posed. Previously, BH-NeRF addressed the ill-posed problem by assuming Keplerian dynamics of the gas, but this assumption breaks down near the black hole, where the strong gravitational pull of the black hole and increased electromagnetic activity complicate fluid dynamics. To overcome the restrictive assumptions of BH-NeRF, we propose PI-DEF, a physics-informed approach that uses differentiable neural rendering to fit a 4D (time + 3D) emissivity field given EHT measurements. Our approach jointly reconstructs the 3D velocity field with the 4D emissivity field and enforces the velocity as a soft constraint on the dynamics of the emissivity. In experiments on simulated data, we find significantly improved reconstruction accuracy over both BH-NeRF and a physics-agnostic approach. We demonstrate how our method may be used to estimate other physics parameters of the black hole, such as its spin.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the robustness of black hole ringdown to stochastic horizon-scale structure within an effective field framework. Consistent with the understanding that the spectral instability of quasinormal modes does not necessarily imply observational breakdown, our results demonstrate that the macroscopic gravitational waveform remains robust. We identify the phase averaging mechanism as the physical origin of this stability, demonstrating that the spatial integration of the wave equation efficiently attenuates ultraviolet geometric details below the resolution limit of the probing wavelength. Building on the scaling law $\mathcal{M} \propto \epsilon^2$ and the characteristic mismatch profile with respect to $L_c$, we propose a geometric selection rule for observability: a detectable signal imposes a strict dual constraint requiring both macroscopic spatial coherence ($L_c \sim M$) and classical-level intensity ($\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-4}$). This criterion quantitatively rules out the observability of incoherent, high-entropy quantum foam, suggesting that any significant ringdown deviation would serve as definitive evidence for macroscopically coherent horizon structures.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole perturbation theory beyond second order is not well understood because typically one defines the meaning of gauge invariance order by order which is ambiguous. In this series of works we therefore developed a new approach which disentangles the meaning of gauge invariance from the perturbative order. It is based on the reduced phase space approach to the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity and constructs a non-perturbative, albeit implicit, formulation of the dynamics of only observables that are gauge invariant to all orders. To obtain explicit expressions, perturbation theory is then employed, but now only perturbations are considered that are gauge invariant to all orders. There are both spherically symmetric and non-symmetric observables and the formulation takes the (perturbative) backreaction between those fully into account. The formulation has access to both the exterior and interior of the dynamical horizon. In previous papers of this series we have introduced the general formalism and performed consistency checks with second order results obtained in other approaches. The real virtue of our approach starts emerging at higher than second order where we expect differences from previous works both due to backreaction effects and because we work with observables that are gauge invariant to all orders, not only up to a given order. In this paper, we consider the third order. Also new to our approach is that we start from a non-perturbative, namely polynomial, version of the constraints which therefore are finite polynomials in all degrees of freedom before reducing, rather than an infinite series. This allows for an exact and non-perturbative, while implicit, solution of the constraints which does not need to truncate the series and thus is of tremendous technical advantage.

 - **Abstract**
 It has traditionally been believed that fermionic entanglement generally outperforms bosonic entanglement in relativistic frameworks, and that bosonic entanglement experiences sudden death in extreme gravitational environments. In this study, we analyze the genuine N-partite entanglement, measured by negativity, of bosonic and fermionic GHZ states, focusing on scenarios where a subset of $m$ ($m<N$) constituents interacts with Hawking radiation generated by a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. Surprisingly, we find that quantum entanglement between the non-gravitational and gravitational modes for the bosonic field is stronger than that in the same modes for the fermionic field within dilaton spacetime. This study challenges the traditional belief that ``fermionic entanglement always outperforms bosonic entanglement" in the relativistic framework. However, quantum entanglement between the gravitational modes and the combined gravitational and non-gravitational modes is weaker for the bosonic field than for the fermionic field in the presence of a dilaton black hole. Finally, the connection between the global N-partite entanglement in the bosonic field and that in the fermionic field is influenced by the gravitational field's intensity. Our study reveals the intrinsic relationship between quantum entanglement of bosonic and fermionic fields in curved spacetime from a new perspective, and provides theoretical guidance for selecting appropriate field-based quantum resources for relativistic quantum information tasks under extreme gravitational conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the embedding of regular black holes in an expanding universe and study how the ultraviolet modifications to the Schwarzschild geometry that regularize the black hole singularity affect the exterior universe's expansion rate. We consider several proposals for the regular black hole geometry and obtain the corresponding Friedmann equations for a universe filled only with dust and black holes. We show that different proposals have different implications which may be distinguished. We then test the hypothesis that the UV corrections to the black hole geometry may be responsible for the current phase of accelerated expansion. To this aim we constrain the value of the regular black hole UV cutoff parameter from observations. Interestingly we find that the best fit is obtained by values of the parameter corresponding to regular horizonless compact objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Modified gravity theories have been extensively studied recently as viable substitutes for general relativity to deal with cosmological issues like dark energy and late-time cosmic acceleration. In the present work, we investigate the dynamical behavior of the $f(R,L,T)$ gravity model with a scalar field utilizing exponential potential, where $R$ represents the Ricci scalar, $L$ is the Lagrangian density and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. We concentrate on a specific type of modified gravity characterized by $f(R,L,T) =R+\alpha L+\beta T$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are positive constants. We study the dynamical behavior and late-time evolution of a cosmological model using a thorough phase-space analysis. We assess important cosmological parameters at the critical places, such as the density parameters corresponding to various cosmic components, the deceleration parameter, and the effective equation of state parameter. The nature of the cosmic phases such as matter-dominated, radiation-dominated, and accelerated expansion eras, described using these quantities.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the motion of test particles around Kerr--Bertotti--Robinson (KBR) black hole (BH) and explore how the three defining parameters the mass $M$, rotation parameter $a$, and magnetic parameter $B$ influence their dynamics. We derive analytical expressions for the energy and angular momentum of stable equatorial circular orbits, along with the corresponding radial and latitudinal oscillation frequencies, as functions of $M$, $a$, and $B$. We also examine the key features of the quasi-periodic oscillations of test particles near stable circular orbits, including the precession effects such as periastron precession and the Lense-Thirring effect. Finally, we compare our results with those corresponding to the Kerr BH. We find that particle motion is strongly shaped by the BH parameters. Using a WKB approach, we also study scalar quasinormal modes of a rotating KBR BH in an external magnetic field and show that the magnetic field increases damping, while rotation and angular momentum mainly set the oscillation frequencies. Alternatively, general relativistic modelling of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion onto a rapidly rotating KBR BH shows that two distinct physical structures emerge and cyclically transform into one another over time. These processes produce either a strongly oscillating flip-flop shock cone or a nearly stationary toroidal structure, with their formation governed by the black hole spin and magnetic curvature. Power spectral analysis shows that these configurations give rise to low and high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations, offering a unified explanation for the multiple quasi-periodic oscillations observed in rapidly spinning X--ray binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate stationary, non-axisymmetric black hole solutions in AdS$_3$ gravity, known as black flower geometries, in the Chern-Simons formulation. Boundary conditions are specified by a collective field theory-inspired Hamiltonian with field-dependent chemical potentials and angularly inhomogeneous boundary data. We construct a tractable class of solutions and analyze their geometric and thermodynamic properties, obtaining an entropy with nontrivial dependence on the angular deformation. Upon quantization of the boundary theory via bosonization, the boundary degrees of freedom are mapped to relativistic free fermions. We explicitly construct and count the microstates associated with a given black flower geometry and find exact agreement with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
