 - **Abstract**
 The background evolution in two-field inflation can feature two distinct stages, corresponding to the evolution along two successive field directions. When the second stage occurs at a significantly lower energy scale, the inflationary trajectory includes a sharp transition, accompanied by a series of rapid turns in field space. Fluctuations crossing the Hubble horizon during this turning phase can experience amplification by several orders of magnitude. This mechanism is very intuitive and can be implemented even in simple two-field models. It produces a peak in the scalar power spectrum that can lead to significant abundances of primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 The accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising environments for producing binary black hole (BBH) mergers, which have been detected via gravitational waves (GW) with LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). BBH mergers embedded in AGN disks are unique among GW formation channels in their generic ability to produce electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, via interactions between the merger remnant and the surrounding disk gas (though these are not always observable). While such mergers represent valuable multi-messenger sources, the lack of predictive statistical models in existing literature currently limits our ability to select possible EM counterparts with GW detections in archival data and in real time using time-domain surveys such as ZTF or LSST. Here, we employ the Monte Carlo For AGN Channel Testing and Simulation code (\texttt{McFACTS}\footnote{this https URL}) to predict the bolometric luminosities of jets and shocks associated with LVK-detectable BBH merger remnants in AGN disks. \texttt{McFACTS} predicts the distribution of GW observables for an underlying BH population and disk model. In this work we present a new capability that simultaneously generates the distribution of bolometric EM luminosities corresponding to these predicted GW detections. We show that (i) migration traps in dense, Sirko-Goodman-like AGN disks efficiently drive hierarchical BH mergers, yielding high-mass, high-spin BH remnants capable of powering observable EM counterparts across merger generations; and ii) mergers embedded in sufficiently dense disks with chirp mass $\mathcal{M}\gtrsim40M_\odot$ are highly likely to yield observable EM counterparts for sufficiently long-lived disks and top-heavy BH initial mass functions.

 - **Abstract**
 Dense stellar environments like nuclear star clusters (NSCs) can dynamically assemble gravitational wave (GW) sources. We consider a population of single stellar mass black holes (BHs) in the inner $0.1$~pc of a NSC surrounding a $4 \times 10^6$~M$_\odot$ supermassive black hole (SMBH). Using a semianalytic model, we account for direct collisions between BHs and stars and GW capture between BHs. We explore the effect of the initial BH mass and spin distributions on their final properties and the production of GW sources. Specifically, we consider upper and lower limits for the BH initial mass distribution, and we account for the possibility that a subset of our initial population are the merger products of primordial BH binaries. We find that $\sim 500$ M$_{\odot}$ intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) can form for our upper limit mass distribution, while our lower limit mass distribution forms none. Most IMBHs $\gtrsim 200$~M$_\odot$ eventually sink towards the center of the cluster and merge with the SMBH. We also find that BH-star collisions create a more uniform spin distribution. Our results have implications for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA sources. We find that the overall merger rate depends primarily on the upper limits of the initial BH mass distribution, ranging from $\sim10^{-10}$ to $\sim10^{-9}$~yr$^{-1}$ per galaxy. However, primordial binaries increase the number of second and higher generation mergers by an order of magnitude.

#### Emergence of cyclic flux eruptions in kinetic simulations of magnetized spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamics of black hole magnetospheres critically depend on the black hole spin and on the structure of the accretion flow. In the limit of a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a zero-net angular momentum flow, accretion is spherical. However, in the presence of a large-scale vertical magnetic field, the classical Bondi accretion model is significantly altered. The frozen-in field is stretched radially as the plasma is pulled inward by gravity. This continues until the restoring force from the magnetic tension suddenly expels the material and resets the field, allowing a new cycle to begin. Although this scenario has been well depicted in previous studies, it remains incomplete as the issues of dissipation and particle acceleration are not yet fully resolved. In this work, we aim to revisit these issues with a first-principles kinetic plasma model. We perform two-dimensional global general relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of magnetized spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole, for both pair and electron-ion plasmas. The simulations are evolved over long timescales to capture multiple flux eruption events and establish a quasi-steady state. For each accretion cycle, we find that the system goes through three main stages: (i) an ideal advection phase where magnetic flux through the horizon increases quasi-linearly with time; (ii) a reconnection-regulated phase where the net increase of the flux is slowed down by intermittent reconnection events near the horizon; and (iii) a flaring phase when a major, large-scale reconnection event expels the flux, leading to efficient particle acceleration. The emergence of large-amplitude quasi-periodic flux eruptions and concomitant particle acceleration is reminiscent of Sgr A* flaring activity. This phenomenon could also be applicable to quiescent black holes, especially isolated black holes accreting the interstellar medium.

#### Expanding the Horizon of Black Hole Imaging with AtLAST

 - **Abstract**
 The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has directly resolved and imaged two supermassive black holes and opening a new window on black hole physics. However, the current array is limited to only these two brightest nearby targets. This white paper outlines how future EHT upgrades, anchored by the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), will enable a transformative expansion of the accessible population of event-horizon-scale sources. By substantially improving sensitivity and multi-frequency capabilities, EHT+AtLAST will enable demographic studies of black hole growth, accretion physics, and jet launching across a wide range of masses, environments, and accretion states.

#### Thermodynamics and shadow of Simpson-Visser black hole with phantom global monopoles

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03888

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the thermodynamics and shadow of a non-rotating Simpson Visser black hole with a phantom global monopole. The model is governed by three parameters: the coupling constant $\xi$, the energy scale of symmetry breaking $\eta$, and the bounce parameter $a$, which jointly influence horizon structure and observational signatures. Using specific heat and free-energy analysis, we show that small-horizon configurations are locally thermodynamically stable but never globally favored. Analytical solutions of null geodesics reveal that the photon sphere radius depends on the bounce parameter $a$ and the energy scale of symmetry breaking $\eta$, while the critical impact parameter is still unaffected by $a$. Moreover, the photon sphere radius and critical impact parameter, showing that increasing $\eta$ enlarges both quantities for an ordinary global monopole, while reducing them in the phantom case. Our results highlight how the bounce parameter and phantom global monopole significantly alter the black hole's physical and geometric properties.

#### Comparative Analysis of Holographic Dark Energy Models in $f(R,T^2)$ Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the Renyi Holographic dark energy, Sharma-Mittal Holographic dark energy and Generalized Holographic dark energy models in the framework of $f(R,T^2)$ gravity, where $R$ denotes the Ricci scalar and $T^2$ represents the self-contraction of the stress-energy tensor. For this purpose we employed two horizons as infrared cut-offs, such as Hubble horizon and Ricci horizon. The analysis is conducted for a non-interacting scenario in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. By considering a specific form of this modified gravity, we reconstruct the corresponding gravitational models based on these selected dark energy formulations. Additionally, a stability analysis is performed for all cases and the evolution of the equation of state parameter is examined. Our finding indicates that the reconstructed $f(R,T^2)$ models effectively describe both the phantom and quintessence phases of cosmic evolution, aligning with the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. This study highlights the deep interconnections between holographic dark energy models and modified gravity theories, offering valuable insights into the large scale dynamics of the cosmos.

#### Strong field gravitational lensing of particles by a black-bounce-Schwarzschild black hole

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational lensing of relativistic and nonrelativistic neutral massive particles in the black-bounce-Schwarzschild black hole spacetime is investigated in the strong deflection limit. Beginning with the explicit equations of motion of a massive particle in the regular spacetime, we achieve the equation of the particle sphere and thus the radius of the unstable timelike circular orbit. It is interesting to find that the particle sphere equation can reduce to the well-known photon sphere equation, when the particle's initial velocity is equal to the speed of light. We adopt the strong field limit approach to calculate the black-bounce-Schwarzschild deflection angle of the particle subsequently, and obtain the strong-deflection lensing observables of the relativistic images of a pointlike particle source. The observables mainly include the apparent angular particle sphere radius, the angular separation between the outermost relativistic image and the other ones which are packed together, and the ratio between the particle-flux magnification of the outermost image and that of the packed ones (or equivalently, their resulted magnitudelike difference). The velocity effects induced by the deviation of the initial velocity of the particle from light speed on the corresponding strong-field lensing observables of the images of a pointlike light source in the regular geometry, along with these on the strong deflection limit coefficients and the critical impact parameter of the lightlike case, are then formulated. Serving as an application of the results, we finally concentrate on evaluating the astronomical detectability of the velocity effects on the lensing observables and analyzing their dependence on the parameters, by modeling the Galactic supermassive black hole (i.e., Sgr A$^{\ast}$) as the lens.

#### Light deflection in the gravimagnetic dipole spacetime

 - **Abstract**
 The gravimagnetic dipole is an asymptotically flat, stationary, axisymmetric vacuum solution to Einstein's General Relativity describing two non-extreme black holes with equal masses and opposite NUT charges connected by a Misner string. The string tension's can be set to zero by choosing the black hole separation accordingly, yielding a stable system of oppositely rotating black holes at a fixed distance. Numerical simulations of massless particle geodesics reveal gravitational lensing effects for extended sources at infinity on the equatorial plane or on the vertical axis.

#### Chaotic Dynamics in Extremal Black Holes: A Challenge to the Chaos Bound

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.04423

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate chaotic dynamics in extremal black holes by analyzing the motion of massless particles in both Reissner-Nordström and Kerr geometries. Two complementary approaches (i) taking the extremal limit of non-extremal solutions and (ii) working directly in the extremal background, yield consistent results. We find that, contrary to naive extrapolation of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) chaos bound, the Lyapunov exponent remains positive even at zero temperature. For Reissner-Nordström black holes, chaos diminishes but persists at extremality, while for Kerr black holes it strengthens with increasing spin. These results demonstrate that extremal black holes exhibit residual chaotic dynamics that violate the MSS bound, establishing them as qualitatively distinct dynamical phases of gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 Photon spheres have attracted considerable interest in the studies of black holes and other astrophysical objects. For different categories of spacetimes (or gravitational sources), the existence of photon spheres and their distributions are dramatically influenced by the geometric and topological properties of spacetimes and characteristics of the corresponding gravitational fields. In this work, we carry out a geometric analysis on photon spheres for different categories of spacetime (including black hole spacetime, ultra-compact object's spacetime, regular spacetime, and naked singularity spacetime). Some universal properties and conclusions are obtained for these spacetimes. We mostly focus on the existence of photon spheres, the total number of photon spheres $n = n_{\text{stable}} + n_{\text{unstable}}$, the subtraction of stable photon sphere and unstable photon sphere $w = n_{\text{stable}} - n_{\text{unstable}}$ in different categories of spacetimes. These conclusions are derived solely from geometric properties of optical geometry of spacetimes, irrelevant to the specific spacetime metric forms. Besides, our results successfully recover some important theorems on photon spheres proposed in recent years.

#### Impact of Higher-Order Modes on Eccentricity Measurement in Binary Black Hole Gravitational Waves

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the systematic biases in measuring orbital eccentricity for binary black hole (BBH) mergers that arise when higher-order modes (HOMs) of gravitational waves are neglected in waveform modeling. Using Bayesian inference with the state-of-the-art eccentric, spin-aligned, higher-mode effective-one-body model SEOBNRv5EHM, we reanalyze six previously suggested eccentric gravitational-wave events--GW190521, GW190620, GW190701, GW191109, GW200129, and GW200208\_222617. Comparing results with its dominant-mode-only counterpart SEOBNRv5E, we find no statistically significant HOM-induced bias in eccentricity for any of these events, including GW190521, whose eccentricity has been debated in the literature. To identify parameter regimes vulnerable to HOM omission, we perform a broad zero-noise injection campaign varying detector-frame total mass, mass ratio, eccentricity, inclination, and network SNR. We find that significant systematic biases ($\Delta_e/\sigma > 1$) arise predominantly in systems with high total mass ($M^{\rm det}\gtrsim120M_\odot$), highly asymmetric mass ratios ($q \gtrsim 4$), near edge-on orientations ($\theta_\textrm{JN} \gtrsim 30^\circ$), and high SNRs ($\rho^N_\textrm{mf}\approx50$). Notably, for quasi-circular BBHs with $M^{\rm det}\gtrsim140M_\odot$, neglecting HOMs may lead to strong false-positive evidence for nonzero eccentricity. By contrast, for lower-mass systems ($M^{\rm det}\sim100 M_\odot$), HOM exclusion produces negligible eccentricity biases. Our results demonstrate that although current eccentric candidates are not impacted by HOM omission, future eccentricity measurements--particularly for massive, asymmetric, or edge-on systems--require HOM-inclusive waveforms to avoid substantial systematic errors.
