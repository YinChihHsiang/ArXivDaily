#### Constraining the AGN tori at cosmic noon using high-resolution JWST imaging and simultaneous SED fitting

 - **Abstract**
 There is evidence for significant evolution in the gaseous and dust properties of galaxies since the era of cosmic noon ($1\lesssim z\lesssim 2.5$). The well known co-evolution of supermassive black holes with their host galaxies suggests a constant connection between the small-scale (nuclear) and large-scale regions of galaxies. A fundamental component of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is the "torus", a dense, dusty structure that acts as the interface between the accretion disc and the ISM of the host galaxy. The transitional nature of the torus makes it a prime subject to search for evolution since cosmic noon. We use high-resolution near- and mid-IR imaging from the JWST CEERS program to disentangle the emission from the torus in unprecedented detail for 88 X-ray selected AGN at $z\sim2$. We employ a novel SED fitting technique that combines archival low-resolution multi-band photometry at UV to FIR wavelengths with the new high-resolution JWST photometry to constrain essential AGN and torus parameters, such as accretion disc luminosity, torus opening angle, and inclination angle. We demonstrate that this SED fitting approach leads to better AGN characterisation and tighter constraints on AGN parameters. The population-level analysis finds that the Covering Fraction ($CF$) distribution peaks at $\approx0.25$ with a long tail towards higher $CF$. Despite the well-known evolution of the ISM and structural properties of AGN hosts to these redshifts, the $CF$ distribution of our sample does not show any strong statistical difference with that found in local AGN of equivalent luminosity, or with those at intermediate redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the observation of gravitational waves from two binary black hole coalescences during the fourth observing run of the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA detector network, GW241011 and GW241110. The sources of these two signals are characterized by rapid and precisely measured primary spins, non-negligible spin--orbit misalignment, and unequal mass ratios between their constituent black holes. These properties are characteristic of binaries in which the more massive object was itself formed from a previous binary black hole merger, and suggest that the sources of GW241011 and GW241110 may have formed in dense stellar environments in which repeated mergers can take place. As the third loudest gravitational-wave event published to date, with a median network signal-to-noise ratio of $36.0$, GW241011 furthermore yields stringent constraints on the Kerr nature of black holes, the multipolar structure of gravitational-wave generation, and the existence of ultralight bosons within the mass range $10^{-13}$--$10^{-12}$ eV.

#### Revisiting the unification of tidal disruption events with polarimetry

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruptions of stars by supermassive black holes produce multi-wavelength emission, of which the optical emission is of ambiguous origin. A unification scenario of tidal disruption events (TDEs) has been proposed to explain the different classes of X-ray and optically selected events by introducing a dependence on the viewing angle and geometry. This work aims to test the unification scenario among optically bright TDEs using polarimetry. By studying the optical linear polarisation of 19 TDEs (of which 9 newly analysed in this work), we place constraints on their photosphere geometry, inclination, and the emission process responsible for the optical radiation. We study how these properties correlate with the relative X-ray brightness. We find that 14/16 non-relativistic events can be accommodated by the unification model. Continuum polarisation levels of optical TDEs lie most often in the range P ~ 1-2% (13 events), and for all except one event, remain below 6%. For those optical TDEs that have multi-epoch polarimetry, the continuum polarisation decreases after peak light for 5/10 events, increases for 3/10 events, and stays nearly constant for 2/10 events. When observed after +70 days (7/16 events), they become consistent with P = 0% within uncertainties (5/7 events). This implies the photosphere geometries of TDEs are at least initially asymmetric and evolve rapidly which, if tracing the formation of the accretion disk, suggests efficient circularisation. The polarisation signatures of emission lines of 7 TDEs directly support a scenario in which optical light is reprocessed in an electron-scattering photosphere. [...] However, a subset of events deviates from the unification model to some extent, suggesting this model may not fully capture the diverse behaviour of TDEs. Multi-epoch polarimetry plays a key role in understanding the evolution and emission mechanisms of TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 A radiation field can be excited via parametric resonance when an oscillating axion field couples to the electromagnetic sector through a Chern-Simons interaction. As demonstrated in previous works, this mechanism can generate primordial magnetic fields shortly after recombination and provide sufficient ultraviolet radiation for the formation of direct collapse black holes (DCBHs). In this study, I analyze constraints on the parametric resonance scenario from global 21cm observations. I find that there exist viable regions in the parameter space that satisfy both observational limits and the physical requirements of the magnetic field and DCBH formation scenarios.

#### Jacobi capture as a pathway to off-center massive black hole binaries in dwarf galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of high-redshift supermassive black holes with JWST has renewed interest in the processes driving black hole growth. At the same time, both simulations and observations point to a widespread population of off-center intermediate-mass black holes in dwarf galaxies. Their ability to merge outside galactic centers may play a key role in shaping black hole mass assembly. Here, we investigate the dynamics of off-center black holes in dwarf galaxies hosting cored dark matter haloes, where long dynamical friction timescales and core stalling naturally arise. By embedding off-center black holes into an idealized galactic potential and scanning a wide range of orbital configurations, we assess the likelihood of close interactions through Jacobi capture. We find that captures occur in about 13% of cases. Such captures, possibly sustained within compact stellar systems like stripped nuclei or globular clusters, represent a crucial first step toward assembling massive black hole binaries beyond galactic centers.

#### Simulating the late stages of WD-BH/NS mergers: an origin for fast X-ray transients and GRBs with periodic modulations

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies indicate that mergers of a white dwarf (WD) with a neutron star (NS) or a stellar-mass black hole (BH) may be a potential progenitor channel for certain merger-kind, but long-duration $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs), e.g., GRBs 230307A and 211211A. The relatively large tidal disruption radius of the WD can result in non-negligible residual orbital eccentricity ($0 \lesssim e \lesssim 0.2$), causing episodic mass transfer, i.e., repeated tidal disruptions (RPDs) of the WD. We perform smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics simulations of RPDs in sixteen WD-BH/NS systems, capturing the subsequent mass transfer and accretion. The WD undergoes RPDs near the orbital periastron, modulating the ensuing accretion process, leading to variations of the accretion rate on the orbital period. Across all simulations, the peak accretion rates range from $4 \times10^{-4}$ to 0.2 $M_{\odot} \rm \ s^{-1}$, while the RPD duration spans from $\sim$ 10 s to an hour. More compact systems, i.e., those with a higher mass ratio (higher WD mass and lower accretor mass), tend to undergo fewer RPD cycles, resulting in shorter durations and higher accretion rates. If such events can launch relativistic jets, three categories of non-thermal X/$\gamma$-ray transients are predicted, in decreasing order of their mean accretion rates: (1) an X-ray transient with a simultaneous GRB, both lasting for $10^{1-2}$ s; (2) a longer X-ray transient lasting up to $10^{2-3}$ s that has a GRB appearing only at its later phase ; (3) an ultra-long X-ray transient lasting for $\sim 10^{3}$ s without a GRB. A generic feature of these transients is that their prompt emission light curves are probably periodically modulated with periods of a few to tens of seconds.

#### Probing the Penrose Process: Images of Split Hotspots and Their Observational Signatures

 - **Abstract**
 While theoretically established for decades, the Penrose process - energy extraction from rotating black holes - still lacks clear observational evidence. A promising theoretical framework posits magnetic reconnection in the ergosphere as a trigger, causing a plasmoid to separate into an escaping positive-energy fragment and an infalling negative-energy one. In this work, we investigate the observational imprints of this scenario. We treat the energized plasmoid as a hotspot and calculate its light curves for a realistic plasma magnetization. In particular, we further compare with the scenario in which the plasmoid, after fragmentation, falls into the black hole with positive energy, while all other conditions remain unchanged. Our results reveal that the process of fragmentation generates distinct flares, whose characteristics depend heavily on whether the infalling fragment carries negative or positive energy. We propose that these differences serve as identifiable signatures of the Penrose process.

#### Probing Gravity at Large Scales with kSZ-Reconstructed Velocities and CMB Lensing

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27605

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new method for measuring the $E_G$ statistic that combines two CMB secondaries -- the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect and CMB lensing -- for the first time to probe gravity on linear scales. The $E_G$ statistic is a discriminating tool for modified gravity theories, which leave imprints in lensing observables and peculiar velocities. Existing $E_G$ measurements rely on redshift space distortions (RSD) to infer the velocity field. Here, we employ kSZ velocity-reconstruction instead of RSD, a complementary technique that constrains the largest-scale modes better than the galaxy survey it uses. We construct a novel $\widehat{V}_G$ estimator that involves a ratio between cross-correlations of a galaxy sample with a CMB convergence map and that with a 3D kSZ-reconstructed velocity field. We forecast for current and upcoming CMB maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Simons Observatory (SO), respectively, in combination with three spectroscopic galaxy samples from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We find cumulative detection significances in the range $S/N \sim 20-55$, which can robustly test the scale-independent $E_G$ prediction under general relativity (GR) at different effective redshifts of the galaxy samples ($z\approx 0.73, 1.33, 1.84$). In particular, the SO$\times$DESI LRG measurement would be able to distinguish between GR and certain modified gravity models, including Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ and Chameleon theories, with high confidence. The proposed $\widehat{V}_G$ estimator opens up a new avenue for stress-testing gravity and the $\Lambda$CDM+GR model at the largest observable scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for gravitational-wave background signals produced by various early Universe processes in the Advanced LIGO O4a dataset, combined with the data from the earlier O1, O2, and O3 (LIGO-Virgo) runs. The absence of detectable signals enables powerful constraints on fundamental physics. We derive gravitational-wave background energy density upper limits from the O1-O4a data to constrain parameters associated with various possible processes in the early Universe: first-order phase transitions, cosmic strings, domain walls, stiff equation of state, axion inflation, second-order scalar perturbations, primordial black hole binaries, and parity violation. In our analyses, the presence of an astrophysical background produced by compact (black hole and neutron star) binary coalescences throughout the Universe is also considered. We address the implications for various cosmological and high energy physics models based on the obtained parameter constraints. We conclude that LIGO-Virgo data already yield significant constraints on numerous early Universe scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the conformal regularization of Gauss-Bonnet gravity in four-dimensional Riemann-Cartan geometry, employing a consistent dimensional derivative scheme. Within this regularized framework, we derive the complete field equations and construct novel static spherically symmetric black hole solutions. Our central finding is that the regularized Gauss-Bonnet term acts as an intrinsic source for a long-range torsion field, providing a purely four-dimensional mechanism to sustain torsion as a hair on black holes, without reliance on extra dimensions.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Ruffini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134 (2025) 8, 081403] pointed out that the repetitive Penrose process cannot drain the entire extractable energy of a Kerr black hole. In this Letter, we further point out that the charge of a Reissner-Nordström black hole cannot drop down to exactly zero via the repetitive electric Penrose process that is terminated after a finite number of iterative steps, indicating a thermodynamical third-law analog for the repetitive electric Penrose process.

#### Entanglement Entropy in Loop Quantum Gravity through Quantum Error Correction

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26911

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel method for computing entanglement entropy across surfaces in Loop Quantum Gravity by employing techniques from quantum error correcting codes. In this construction, the redundancy encoded in the gauge invariant subspace is made manifest by embedding it in a larger Hilbert space. The enlarged Hilbert space of a surface does not factorize, which necessitates an algebraic formulation of the entanglement entropy using von Neumann algebras. Using this approach, we are able to reproduce the expected black hole entropy through the canonical ensemble. This includes a direct realization of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, providing a first principles derivation of the black hole entropy within a kinematical framework of loop quantum gravity. The algebraic techniques developed in this work can be used to compute the entanglement entropy across arbitrary surfaces.

#### Entanglement entropy in Loop Quantum Gravity and geometrical area law

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26922

 - **Abstract**
 The non-factorizing nature of the Hilbert space in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) due to gauge invariance requires a generalized definition of entanglement entropy. This work employs the framework of von Neumann algebras to investigate the entanglement entropy in LQG. On a graph, the holonomy and flux operators within a region and on the boundary generate a non-factor type I von Neumann algebra, which is used to define the entanglement entropy for LQG states. This algebraic formalism is applied to ``fixed-area states''--superpositions of spin networks associated with a surface with a definite macroscopic area given by the LQG area spectrum. By maximizing the entropy, we derive a geometrical area law where the entanglement entropy is proportional to the area. In addition, we show that bulk entanglement can renormalize the area-law coefficient and produce logarithmic corrections. The results in this paper closely relate to LQG black hole entropy.

#### The quasinormal modes of the rotating quantum corrected black holes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27320

 - **Abstract**
 The quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a rotating quantum corrected black hole (RQCBH) are studied by employing the hyperboloidal framework for the scalar perturbation. This framework is used to cast the QNMs spectra problem into the two-dimensional eigenvalues problem, then the spectra are calculated by imposing two-dimensional pseudo-spectral method. Based on the resulting spectra, a parameter estimation pipeline for this RQCBH model with gravitational wave data is constructed by using \texttt{pyRing} in the ringdown phase. We find that, even when the RQCBH spectra exhibits a small deviation from the Kerr spectra, the strong correlation between the extra parameter coming from the quantum gravity theory and the intrinsic parameter of black hole may significantly affect the posterior distributions of the mass $M$ and the dimensionless spin $\bar{a}$.

#### Geometric acceleration in $f(Q,C)$ theories

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27415

 - **Abstract**
 The $f(Q,C)$ framework of gravity enables the depiction of an effective dark energy fluid that emerges from geometry itself, thus leading to modifications in the cosmological phenomenology of General Relativity. We pursue this approach to discover new and observationally supported (effective) evolving dark energy models. We propose a general $f(Q,C)$ formulation that cannot be simply split into separate functions of $Q$ and $C$, yet it still results in second-order field equations. By employing a particular type of connection, we derive guidelines for new cosmological models, including a variant of the DGP model that appears to be statistically favored over $\Lambda$CDM. Notably, we also demonstrate how to translate solutions within this $f(Q,C)$ framework to $f(Q)$ counterparts at the background level.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter (DM) can form dense condensates around black holes (BHs), such as superradiant clouds and ultracompact mini halos, which can significantly affect the orbital evolution of their companion objects through dynamical friction (DF). In this work, we define a novel quantity to quantify such effects in the emitted gravitational waves (GWs) in terms of GW amplitude, frequency, and their time derivatives. The information about the density profile can be extracted from this quantity, which characterizes the type of condensate and, therefore, the corresponding DM property. This quantity allows us to probe the dark dense environment by multi-wavelength GW observation with existing ground-based and future space-based GW detectors, potentially reveals the properties of the dark sector and sheds light on the primordial origin of the stellar mass BHs. A null detection can place strong constraints on the relevant DM parameters.

#### Interplay of Null Energy Condition Violations and Thermodynamics in Kiselev Black Hole Evaporation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27454

 - **Abstract**
 The evaporation of black holes with two horizons presents a rich thermodynamic landscape that departs fundamentally from the Schwarzschild paradigm. In this work, we analyze the Hawking temperature dynamics of the Kiselev black hole under varying mass $M$ and anisotropic fluid parameter $N$, explicitly connecting temperature behavior to phase transitions and violations of the null energy condition (NEC). We find that the temperature does not necessarily diverge during evaporation; instead, it typically falls to zero as the black hole evaporates. This cooling behavior is preceded, in certain parameter regimes, by a phase transition marked by a peak in temperature and a divergence in heat capacity. Crucially, the presence and nature of these phase transitions are dictated by the spacetime regions where the NEC is violated: global NEC violation leads to horizon merger and temperature suppression, while partial or absent violation can restore the standard evaporation picture. Our results establish a direct correspondence between thermodynamic stability, horizon dynamics, and energy condition structure in anisotropic black hole spacetimes.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of gravitational waves has intensified the need for efficient, high-precision modeling of the two-body problem in General Relativity. Current analytical methods, primarily the Post-Minkowskian and Post-Newtonian expansions, are inherently perturbative, while numerical relativity remains computationally expensive. In this Letter, we introduce a middle path: an exact renormalization group (RG) equation for classical gravitational systems. We demonstrate that our equation correctly reproduces the first three orders of the Post-Minkowskian expansion. Crucially, it provides a framework for non-perturbative approximations. As a first application, we show that our method efficiently recovers the 1PN two-body action, bypassing the need for complex three-graviton vertex calculations by leveraging the intrinsic nonlinearity of the RG flow. This establishes the exact RG as a powerful new tool for tackling strong-field dynamics in gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we obtain the exact solution of quantum integrable system associated with the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$, both for periodic and for generic open boundary conditions. By means of the fusion technique we derive a closed set of operator identities among the fused transfer matrices. These identities allow us to determine the complete energy spectrum and the corresponding Bethe ansatz equations of the model. Our approach furnishes a systematic framework for studying the spectra of quantum integrable models based on Lie superalgebras, in particular when the $U(1)$ symmetry is broken.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic framework for computing frequency-domain gravitational waveforms from relativistic binary scattering in different asymptotic regimes. The method yields a controlled series expansion that can in principle be extended to arbitrary order in the relevant kinematic parameter. By combining differential-equation techniques with restriction theory and algebraic-geometry methods for impact-parameter-space Fourier integrals, we derive recursion relations that generate the leading-order (tree-level) waveform in both the soft-emission and post-Newtonian regimes, establishing a proof of principle for extending the approach to higher-loop computations. Finally, following constraints from rapid-decay homology, we show that the Fourier integrals underlying the waveform satisfy epsilon-form differential equations mixing Bessel- and exponential-type kernels, marking a first step toward uncovering the analytic structure of the exact solution.
