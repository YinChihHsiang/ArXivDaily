 - **Abstract**
 One of the possible explanations for dark matter is that of compact dark objects of baryonic origin, such as black holes or even planets. Accumulating evidence, including the discovery of merging stellar mass black holes through gravitational waves, point to a population of such objects making up at least some fraction of dark matter. We revisit a historically heavily used probe, quasar spectra, from the new perspective of time variability and gravitational lensing. From a sample of 777 quasars selected from archival data we identify 19 that show decisive evidence of lensing by compact objects with masses measured in the range $5\times 10^{-5} < M/\mathrm{M}_{\odot} < 2\times 10^{-2}$ with 99\% confidence. This is much lower than what is hoped to be detected by even the most futuristic gravitational wave detectors and analysis strategies, but is crucial for theories of compact dark matter, such as primordial black holes predicted from quantum phase transitions in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Third-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) will detect hundreds of thousands of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, reaching redshifts beyond $z\sim3$. To fully exploit joint GW and electromagnetic (EM) detections, dedicated strategies and adapted EM facilities are essential. We investigate the role of Integral Field and Multi-Object Spectroscopy (IFS and MOS) with the Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope (WST) on next generation GW multi-messenger (MM) observations. We consider simulations of BNS populations, their GW detections with ET(+CE), and their EM counterparts: kilonovae (KNe) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We consider two strategies: one in synergy with wide-field photometric surveys, and a galaxy-targeted one exploiting WST high multiplexing. We estimate the number of galaxies in GW error volumes, and identify observational challenges and mitigation strategies. We find that WST can detect KNe up to $z\sim0.4$ and $m_{\mathrm{AB}}\sim25$, and GRB afterglows beyond $z>1$ for $\Theta_{\mathrm{view}}\lesssim15^\circ$. KN observations are best scheduled 12-24 hours post-merger. For poorly localised GRBs, WST IFS can aid the identification. Mini-IFUs and galaxy catalogues complete to $z\leq0.5$ are key to EM counterpart detection. Even at low $z$, the number of galaxies can be huge-thousands at $z<0.1$, tens of thousands at $z<0.2$. Events at $z<0.3$ with localisation $<10$deg$^{2}$ are golden cases for WST, requiring few exposures to target all galaxies. Detecting and characterising EM counterparts of BNS detected in the extended volume explored by next-generation interferometers will be challenging. We show that high-sensitivity, wide-field, high-multiplex spectroscopic facilities are powerful instruments to fully exploit the new multi-messenger science opportunities enabled by next generation GW detectors.
#### On the rapid growth of SMBHs in high-z galaxies: the aftermath of Population III.1 stars

 - **Abstract**
 The vast amount of energy released by active galactic nuclei (AGN) is increasingly recognized as a key driver of evolution not only in massive galaxies and clusters, but also in low-mass dwarf galaxies. Despite this, their role in the early stages of galaxy formation and in self-regulating the rapid growth of the first and abundant supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains poorly understood. Through new high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations, we follow the co-evolution of $10^5 M_\odot$ black hole seeds with their host galaxy. The simulated suite progressively spans physics ranging from no AGN feedback and Eddington-limited thermal feedback, to more complex setups including non-Eddington-limited thermal, kinetic and radiative feedback. Across all our models, we find that black hole seeds efficiently reach masses of $\sim10^7 M_\odot$ by z=8. Although they exhibit notably different mass growth histories, these latter seem unimpeded by the presence of AGN feedback. The simulation including radiative feedback is the most distinct, with super-Eddington episodes driving fast and mass-loaded gas outflows (exceeding 2500 km $s^{-1}$) up to $\sim$50 kpc, along with minor stellar mass suppression in the host galaxy. Our measurements are in broad agreement with moderate luminosity quasars recently observed by JWST, producing overmassive black holes, dynamical masses of $\sim10^{9.5} M_\odot$, and high, though short-lived, Eddington fraction accretion rates. These results advocate for a scenario where AGN feedback allows for rapid SMBH growth during the reionisation era, while driving winds that extend deep into the intergalactic medium - shaping host galaxies as well as more distant surroundings.
#### Do Pulsar Timing Datasets Favor Massive Gravity?

 - **Abstract**
 Several observational phenomena suggest that the standard model of cosmology and particle physics requires revision. To address this, we consider the extension of general relativity known as massive gravity (MG). In this Letter, we explore the imprints of MG on the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs): their modified dispersion relation and their additional (two vector and one scalar) polarization modes on the stochastic GW background (SGWB) detected by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). We analyze the effects of massive GWs on the Hellings-Downs curve induced by modification of the overlap reduction function. Our study consists of analyzing observational data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the Chinese PTA Data Release I, and is independent of the origin of the SGWB (astrophysical or cosmological). By considering the bound on the graviton mass imposed through the dispersion relation, we scrutinize the possibility of detecting traces of MG in the PTA observational data. We find that massive GWs predict better fits for the observed pulsar correlations. Future PTA missions with more precise data will hopefully be able to detect the GW additional polarization modes and might be effectively used to constrain the graviton mass.
#### Milliarcsecond astrometric oscillations in AGN as a precursor of multi-messaging gravitational wave events

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) is predicted by various cosmological and evolutionary scenarios for active galactic nuclei. These objects are considered as contributors into the gravitational wave (GW) background and emitters of discrete GW bursts. Yet, SMBHBs remain a rather elusive class of extragalactic objects. Previously we have identified the quasar J2102+6015 as potential SMBHB system based on its oscillating astrometric pattern. We analysed the available VLBI astrometry data and identified another case of astrometric oscillations in the source J0204+1514. We assume these oscillations as manifestations of orbital motion in a binary systems. We estimated parameters of the suspected SMBHB in this source and applied basic theoretical models for projecting its evolution toward coalescence. We also develop a toy model of SMBHB consistent with the discovered astrometric oscillations and give quantitative predictions of GW emission of such the source using the case of J0204+1514 as an example. As an ad hoc result, we also provide a re-assessed estimate of the redshift of J2102+6015, z=1.42. A toy model of the object containing SMBHB with parameters consistent with the observed astrometric oscillations of the source J0204+1514 enabled us to consider GW emission as the cause of the system's orbital evolution. Astrometric VLBI monitoring has an appreciable potential for future detections of SMBHBs as multi-messenger targets for both electromagnetic (in radio domain) and gravitational wave astronomy. To outline the contours of a future physical model connecting SMBHB with detectable GW manifestations, we apply the toy model to the source J0204+1514. We also provide justification for aiming future space-borne VLBI missions toward direct imaging of SMBHBs as a synergistic contribution into future multi-messenger studies involving prospective GW facilities.
#### High resolution radio analysis of the starburst galaxy NGC 4527: signatures of an AGN core

 - **Abstract**
 NGC 4527 is a nearby edge-on spiral galaxy with both starburst and AGN features, hosting a LINER nucleus. We present a radio study of the large-scale structure and nuclear region of this galaxy, based on new uGMRT observations at 700 and 1230 MHz. Our continuum maps reveal extended emission tracing the stellar disk, with no evidence of a radio halo. The spectral index distribution and the presence of PAHs across the disk are consistent with ongoing star formation. In the nuclear region we resolve three compact sources: one at the galactic centre and two symmetrically aligned with the major axis at $\sim400$ pc. The spectral index values and the destruction of PAHs in the central source, together with previously detected X-rays emission, suggest the presence of a low-luminosity AGN. The two off-centre sources are consistent with a star formation ring, coincident with a molecular gas ring previously reported. We explore a scenario where super-Eddington accretion onto the black hole drives a dense wind that falls back onto the disk, triggering star formation in a circumnuclear ring.

 - **Abstract**
 The Milky Way Survey of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has so far observed three classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs): Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor. Based on the observed line-of-sight velocities and metallicities of their member stars, we apply the axisymmetric Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion modeling (JAM) approach to recover their inner dark matter distributions. In particular, both the traditional single-population Jeans model and the multiple population chemodynamical model are adopted. With the chemodynamical model, we divide member stars of each dSph into metal-rich and metal-poor populations. The metal-rich populations are more centrally concentrated and dynamically colder, featuring lower velocity dispersion profiles than the metal-poor populations. We find a diversity of the inner density slopes $\gamma$ of dark matter halos, with the best constraints by single-population or chemodynamical models consistent with each other. The inner density slopes are $0.71^{+0.34}_{-0.35}$, $0.26^{+0.22}_{-0.12}$ and $0.33^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ for Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor, respectively. We also present the measured astrophysical J and D factors of the three dSphs. Our results indicate that the study of the dark matter content of dSphs through stellar kinematics is still subject to uncertainties behind both the methodology and the observed data, through comparisons with previous measurements and data sets.

 - **Abstract**
 The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory has detected very high-energy (VHE) gamma rays from NGC 4278, which is known to host a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). Having only very weak radio jets, the origin of its VHE gamma rays is unclear. In this paper we first show that NGC 4278 has a massive molecular cloud surrounding the nucleus by analyzing data taken with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We then assume that cosmic ray protons are accelerated in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow around the supermassive black hole, which diffuse into the molecular cloud and produce gamma rays and neutrinos via $pp$ interactions. We model the gamma-ray spectra and find that the observations can be explained by such hadronic processes if the AGN activity was higher in the past than at present, and the diffusion coefficient in the molecular cloud is appreciably smaller than in the Milky Way interstellar medium. However, we also show that the high-energy neutrinos co-produced with the gamma rays are unlikely to be detectable even with IceCube-Gen2.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) and other sources within the frequency band of spaceborne gravitational wave observatories like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), Taiji and Tianqin pose unique challenges, as gaps and glitches during the years-long observation lead to both loss of information and spectral leakage. We propose a novel data imputation strategy based on Kalman filter and smoother to mitigate gap-induced biases in parameter estimation. Applied to a scenario where traditional windowing and smoothing technique introduce significant biases, our method mitigates the biases and demonstrates lower computational cost compared to existing data augmentation techniques such as noise inpainting. This framework presents a new gap treatment approach that balances robustness and efficiency for space-based gravitational wave data analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are widely considered the ideal environments for binary black hole (BBH) mergers and the only plausible sites for their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. Graham et al.(2023) identified seven AGN flares that are potentially associated with gravitational-wave (GW) events detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration during the third observing run. In this article, utilizing an additional three years of Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) public data after their discovery, we conduct an updated analysis and find that only three flares can be identified. By implementing a joint analysis of optical and GW data through a Bayesian framework, we find two flares exhibit a strong correlation with GW events, with no secondary flares observed in their host AGN up to 2024 October 31. Combining these two most robust associations, we derive a Hubble constant measurement of $H_{0}= 72.1^{+23.9}_{-23.1} \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ and incorporating the multi-messenger event GW170817 improves the precision to $H_{0}=73.5^{+9.8}_{-6.9} \ \mathrm{km \ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$. Both results are consistent with existing measurements reported in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray reflection spectroscopy has evolved as one of the leading methods to measure black hole spins. However, the question is whether its measurements are subjected to systematic biases, especially considering the possible discrepancy between the spin measurements inferred with this technique and those from gravitational wave observations. In this work, we use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of thin accretion disks around spinning black holes for modeling the accretion process, and then we simulate NuSTAR observations to test the capability of modern reflection models in recovering the input spins. For the first time, we model the electron density and ionization profiles from GRMHD-simulated disks. Our study reveals that current reflection models work well only for fast-rotating black holes. We model the corona as the base of the jet and we find that reflection models with lamppost emissivity profiles fail to recover the correct black hole spins. Reflection models with broken power-law emissivity profiles perform better. As we increase the complexity of the simulated models, it is more difficult to recover the correct input spins, pointing towards the need to update our current reflection models with more advanced accretion disks and coronal geometries.
#### Spherically Symmetric Accretion with Self-Gravity: Analytical Formulae and Numerical Validation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02621

 - **Abstract**
 Spherically symmetric accretion incorporating self-gravity constitutes a three-point boundary value problem (TPBVP) governed by constraints at the outer boundary, sonic point, and accretor surface. Previous studies have two limitations: either employing an incorrect formula for self-gravity potential in analytical treatments, or introducing additional input parameters in numerical implementations to circumvent solving the full TPBVP. To address these issues, we present a self-consistent TPBVP formulation, solved using the relaxation method. We also derive approximate analytical formulae that enable rapid estimates of self-gravity effects. Our analysis identifies a dimensionless parameter $\beta \equiv 2G \bar{\rho} r_\mathrm{out}^2/a_\mathrm{out}^2$ that characterizes the strength of self-gravity, where $\bar{\rho}$ and $r_\mathrm{out}$ are the mean density and outer radius of the flow, respectively, and $a_\mathrm{out}$ is the adiabatic sound speed of the external medium. For practical estimation, $\bar{\rho}$ may be approximated by the external medium density $\rho_\mathrm{out}$. We identify an upper limit for $\beta$, beyond which steady accretion becomes unsustainable -- a behavior consistent with classical gravitational instability that previous studies failed to capture. The accretion rate enhancement decreases monotonically as the adiabatic index $\gamma$ increases. For $\gamma=5/3$, self-gravity ceases to augment the accretion rate. These theoretical predictions are validated by our numerical solutions. We further apply our results to two astrophysical scenarios: hyper-Eddington accretion onto supermassive black hole seeds in the early Universe, where self-gravity is significant; and accretion onto stellar-mass objects embedded in active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks, where self-gravity is non-negligible under certain conditions and should be evaluated using $\beta$.
#### Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Square Kilometre Array using the 21 cm power spectrum at cosmic dawn

 - **Abstract**
 Probing the nature of dark matter (DM) remains an outstanding problem in modern cosmology. The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen during cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during this critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as a powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we systematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum. Assuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach sensitivities of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm}^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 10^{28}\,{\rm seconds}$, for $10\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \leq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the SKA could place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation that are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits. Furthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes. Overall, the SKA holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both DM particles and PBHs, potentially offering new insights into the fundamental nature of DM.
#### $\textit{Twisted echoes of an odd quartet}$: Scalar-induced gravitational waves as a probe of primordial parity-violation

 - **Abstract**
 Parity-violation leaves tell-tale trails in many cosmological observables. We illustrate parity-odd primordial scalar trispectra, that despite being of modest strength, impart detectable chirality to scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). This allows us to impose strong bounds on the parity-odd part of trispectrum. Over certain scales, we find SIGW directly quantify parity-violation in primordial non-Gaussianity, unobscured by the Gaussian contribution. Our results call for treatment of SIGW and parity-odd trispectrum as complementary predictions of parity-violating theories.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the joint effects of relativistic accretion and memory burdened evaporation on the evolution of primordial black holes (PBHs). The memory burden effect, which delays the evaporation by inducing a backreaction and making the evaporation rate scale as an inverse power law of the PBH entropy, opens up a new window that allows PBHs with $M \lesssim 10^{15}~\mathrm{g}$ to survive until the present epoch. Meanwhile, accretion increases the mass of PBHs, thereby enhancing their chances of survival for a given initial mass. We consider two main scenarios: one where PBHs evaporate completely before big bang nucleosynthesis, and another where PBHs persist until today. In the case of evaporation, we analyse the emission of dark matter (DM) and dark radiation (DR) during the process of evaporation. Conversely, in the other case, the surviving PBHs themselves can contribute as DM. We further investigate how relativistic and non-relativistic accretion, together with memory burdened evaporation, impact the parameter space of the emitted DM, the abundance of stable PBHs as DM, and the contribution of DR to the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\mathrm{eff}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Various types of inhomogeneous collapse models in general relativity (GR) lead to the formation of spacetime singularities either visible or hidden by a spacetime horizon. Our aim in the present work is to search for nonsingular models in Rastall gravity that arise as the final outcomes of spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of an inhomogeneous matter cloud. We firstly assume linear equations of state (EoS) for radial and tangential pressure profiles, i.e., $p_r=w_r\rho$ and $p_\theta=w_\theta\rho$, then we set the Rastall parameter in such a way that the effective pressure in radial direction vanishes and examine the conditions under which the spacetime singularity can be avoided. We find exact nonsingular collapse solutions for which the collapsing cloud reaches a minimum physical radius at a finite amount of time and then rebounds to an expanding phase where the matter shells start moving away from each other. The solutions we obtain respect the weak energy condition (WEC), which is important for the physical validity of the model.
#### Extreme mass-ratio inspiral within an ultralight scalar cloud I. Scalar radiation

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study the dynamics of an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) embedded within a scalar cloud populated around the massive black hole. This cloud may be generated through the black hole superradiant process if the wavelength of the scalar particle is comparable to the size of the massive black hole. The EMRI motion perturbs the cloud, producing scalar radiation towards infinity and into the black hole horizon. In addition, the backreaction of the scalar radiation onto the orbit modifies the motion of the EMRI and induces an observable gravitational-wave phase shift for a range of system parameters. We quantify the scalar flux and the induced phase shift, as one of the examples of exactly-solvable, environmental effects of EMRIs.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop the effective field theory (EFT) of perturbations in the context of scalar-tensor theories with a spacelike scalar profile on arbitrary black hole backgrounds. Our construction of the EFT is based on the fact that in the unitary gauge, where the scalar field is chosen as one of the spatial coordinates, the background scalar field spontaneously breaks the diffeomorphism invariance along the direction of its gradient. The residual symmetry on a timelike hypersurface of constant scalar field is referred to as the $(2+1)$d diffeomorphism invariance. We then derive a set of consistency relations, imposed on the EFT parameters, by requiring that the EFT action in the unitary gauge be invariant under the $(2+1)$d diffeomorphisms. For concreteness, we apply the EFT to study the background dynamics of a class of non-static and spherically symmetric solutions, focusing in particular on a black hole solution with a time-varying mass. We emphasize that our EFT framework is broadly applicable to any black hole background as long as the scalar field remains spacelike throughout the spacetime region of interest. This formulation provides a model-independent approach for testing scalar-tensor theories as gravity beyond general relativity in the strong-gravity regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Phantom scalar fields, as a viable candidate for dark energy, have been instrumental in eliminating spacetime singularities and constructing wormholes and regular black holes. We investigate the Einstein-Maxwell-phantom (EMP) framework, in which the Ellis wormholes can be charged and regular black holes can be admitted. While the previous study has shown the stability of EMP wormholes under massless scalar field perturbations, we further perform a comprehensive linear analysis of the EMP spacetime through phantom scalar field perturbations and gravito-electromagnetic field perturbations. Our analyses of effective potentials and finite difference time profiles reveal the linear instability of EMP wormholes. In the black hole scenario, the quasinormal spectra of the EMP theory, where the matrix-valued direct integration method and the Prony method are used, recover those of general relativity when the scalar charge goes to zero. By introducing the concepts of generalized specific charge and mixing angle, we quantify how the relative contributions between the phantom scalar and the electromagnetic fields produce distinct modifications in the quasinormal spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper aims to develop non-interacting ghost dark energy and generalized ghost dark energy models within the framework of $f(Q)$ theory using the correspondence scheme. We use pressureless matter and a power-law scale factor. The cosmic implications of the resulting models are studied through the equation of state parameter and the phase planes. We also check the stability of the reconstructed models through the squared speed of sound parameter. The equation of state parameter exhibits a phantom era, the $(\omega_{D}-\omega^{\prime}_{D})$-plane indicates a freezing region, while the $(r-s)$-plane corresponds to the Chaplygin gas model for both models. It is also found that only the generalized ghost dark energy model remains stable throughout cosmic evolution. We conclude that our findings align well with current observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 Space-borne gravitational wave detection will open the observation window in the 0.1 mHz$-$1 Hz bandwidth, playing a crucial role in the development of cosmology and physics. Precise clock synchronization among satellites is essential for the accurate detection of gravitational wave signals. However, the independent clock counting mechanisms of each satellite pose a significant challenge. This work reports the mathematical model of clock asynchrony, which is mainly dominated by the constant term factor and the linear term factor. Moreover, it experimentally verifies the clock asynchronization technique based on a dual-phasemeter system. Through experimentation, the impacts of these two aspects of clock asynchrony were confirmed, and post-processing techniques were employed to reduce these impacts to as low as $\rm 2\pi \times 10^{-6} rad/Hz^{1/2}@ 3mHz$. Specifically, the constant term factor is measured by Time-delay Interferometry Ranging (TDIR), while the linear term factor can be gauged by clock transmission link. This study provides a reference for understanding the clock asynchrony mechanism and processing clock synchronization issues. Additionally, a low additional noise clock synchronization test system is introduced to support such measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 General relativity predicts that gravitational waves are described by two polarisation states: the plus $+$ state and cross $\times$ state. However, alternate theories of gravity allow up to six polarisations. We employ the gravitational-wave null stream, a linear combination of three or more detectors where the $+$ and $\times$ signals add to zero, leaving behind noise and potentially gravitational waves in non-standard polarisation states. We develop a Gaussian process model to search for extra polarisations beyond general relativity. Using data from 42 three-detector events from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's Third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalogue, we find no evidence of non-standard polarisations. We set upper limits on the fractional deviation in gravitational-wave strain to be as low as 0.39 at 90% credibility for the event GW190602_175927.

 - **Abstract**
 The coupling between matter fields and gravity (encoded in the geometry of spacetime) can be realized in various ways. Most commonly, a minimal coupling principle is employed, meaning that all matter fields, except spinors, couple only to the spacetime metric, while spinors additionally couple to the spacetime connection. Non-minimal couplings between matter fields and spacetime curvature can arise, for example, from quantum field theory on curved spacetime through renormalization corrections, in gauge theories of gravity, and in effective field theories. In this article, we consider a non-minimal coupling $F^{\mu\nu}\tilde{R}{\mu\nu}$ between the field strength tensor of the electromagnetic field $F{\mu\nu}$ and the antisymmetric part of the Ricci tensor $\tilde{R}_{[\mu\nu]}$ in Riemann-Cartan geometry, which is based on a general metric-compatible connection with torsion. We find an exact 4-dimensional vacuum solution that generalizes the Reissner-Nordström black hole from Einstein-Maxwell and reveals new interactions between the intrinsic torsion-spin charge and the electric charge. Qualitatively, this solution exhibits two distinct features: the effective charge is not constrained to be positive, and the sign of the electric charge influences its gravitational effects. We also derive slowly rotating solutions in 3 dimensions, representing a generalized slowly rotating BTZ black hole solution with couplings among the magnetic and electric charges, the angular momentum, and the intrinsic torsion-spin charge.

 - **Abstract**
 In earlier companion papers, we showed that non-singular primordial black holes (PBHs) could account for all the dark matter (DM) over a significantly wider mass range compared to Schwarzschild PBHs. Those studies, mostly based on phenomenological metrics, are now extended by considering the quantum-corrected space-time recently proposed by Zhang, Lewandowski, Ma and Yang (ZLMY), derived from an effective canonical (loop) quantum gravity approach explicitly enforcing general covariance. Unlike the BHs considered earlier, ZLMY BHs are free from Cauchy horizons, and are hotter than their Schwarzschild counterparts. We show that this higher temperature boosts the evaporation spectra of ZLMY PBHs, tightening limits on their abundance relative to Schwarzschild PBHs and shrinking the asteroid mass window where they can constitute all the DM, a result which reverses the earlier trend, but rests on firmer theoretical ground. While stressing the potential key role of quantum gravity effects in addressing the singularity and DM problems, our study shows that working within a consistent theoretical framework can strongly affect observational predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 The local primordial density fluctuations caused by quantum vacuum fluctuations during inflation grow into stars and galaxies in the late universe and, if they are large enough, also produce primordial black holes. We study the formation of the primordial black holes in $k$-essence inflation models with a potential characterized by an inflection point. The background and perturbation equations are integrated numerically for two specific models. Using the critical collapse and peaks formalism, we calculate the abundance of primordial black holes today.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of black hole shadows provides a powerful tool for testing the predictions of general relativity and exploring deviations from the standard Kerr metric in the strong gravitational field regime. Here, we investigate the shadow properties of axisymmetric gravitational compact objects using a coordinate-independent formalism. We analyze black hole shadows in various spacetime geometries, including the Kerr, Taub-NUT, $\gamma$, and Kaluza-Klein metrics, to identify distinctive features that can be used to constrain black hole parameters. To achieve a more robust characterization, we employ both Legendre and Fourier expansions, demonstrating that the Fourier approach may offer better coordinate independence and facilitate cross-model comparisons. Finally, we develop a machine learning framework based on neural networks trained on synthetic shadow data, enabling precise parameter estimation from observational results. Using data from observational astronomical facilities such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), Keck, and the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), we provide constraints on black hole parameters derived from shadow observations. Our findings highlight the potential of coordinate-independent techniques and machine learning for advancing black hole astrophysics and testing fundamental physics beyond general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the frequency-domain quasi-circular precessing binary-black-hole model PhenomXPNR. This model combines the most precise available post-Newtonian description of the evolution of the precession dynamics through inspiral with merger-ringdown model informed by numerical relativity. This, along with a phenomenological model of the dominant multipole asymmetries, results in the most accurate and complete representation of the physics of precessing binaries natively in the frequency-domain to date. All state-of-the-art precessing models show bias when inferring binary parameters in certain regions of the parameter space. We demonstrate that the developments presented ensure that for some precessing systems PhenomXPNR shows the least degree of bias. Further, as a phenomenological, frequency-domain model, PhenomXPNR remains one of the most computationally efficient models available and is therefore well-suited to the era of gravitational-wave astronomy with its ever growing rate of detected signals.
#### A Note on Chaos in Hayward Black Holes with String Fluids

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we examine the onset of thermodynamic chaos in Hayward AdS black holes with string fluids, emphasizing the effects of temporal and spatially periodic perturbations. We apply Melnikov's approach to examine the perturbed Hamiltonian dynamics and detect the onset of chaotic behavior within the spinodal regime of the $(P-v)$ plot. In the case of temporal perturbations induced by thermal quenches, chaos occurs for perturbation amplitude $\gamma$ exceeding a critical threshold that can be determined by charge $q$ and the string fluid parameter. From the equation of state of the black hole, a general condition can be established indicating that under temporal perturbations, the existence of charge is an essential prerequisite for chaos. In this regime, neutral Hayward black holes do not exhibit chaotic dynamics. However, regardless of the presence of charge, spatial perturbations result in chaotic behavior. The nonlinear interplay between the regularized core geometry and string fluids drives the formation of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits in phase space, validating the persistence of chaos. The results obtained in this work, highlights the role of nonlinear matter fields and curvature regularization mechanisms in governing thermodynamic instability and the onset of chaos in Hayward black holes in AdS.
#### Neutron stars in degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor theories: Axial perturbations

 - **Abstract**
 We study the axial (or odd-parity) perturbations of neutron stars in a one-parameter subclass of Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. After recalling the equilibrium neutron star configurations obtained in a previous work by solving the generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations in DHOST theories, we derive the action at quadratic order in linear perturbations of axial type. We then compute the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) for several values of the modified gravity parameter and various equations of state, observing deviations of both frequencies and damping times with respect to general relativity. We also analyze the impact of our modified gravity parameter on the universal relations relating the (rescaled) frequencies and damping times to the compactness of the neutron star.
