#### Identification of Strongly Lensed Gravitational Wave Events Using Squeeze-and-Excitation Multilayer Perceptron Data-efficient Image Transformer

 - **Abstract**
 With the advancement of third-generation gravitational wave detectors, the identification of strongly lensed gravitational wave (GW) events is expected to play an increasingly vital role in cosmology and fundamental physics. However, traditional Bayesian inference methods suffer from combinatorial computational overhead as the number of events grows, making real-time analysis infeasible. To address this, we propose a deep learning model named Squeeze-and-Excitation Multilayer Perceptron Data-efficient Image Transformer (SEMD), based on Vision Transformers, which classifies strongly lensed GW events by modeling morphological similarity between time-frequency spectrogram pairs. By integrating Squeeze-and-Excitation attention mechanisms and multilayer perceptrons , SEMD achieves strong feature extraction and discrimination. Trained and evaluated on simulated datasets using Advanced LIGO and Einstein Telescope noise, the model demonstrates robustness and generalization across different detector sensitivities and physical conditions, highlighting the promise of deep learning for rapid identification of strongly lensed GW signals.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of compact binary mergers with sub-solar masses at gravitational-wave observatories could mark the groundbreaking discovery of primordial black holes (PBHs). Concurrently, evidence for a nHz stochastic gravitational wave background observed by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) could suggest a non-astrophysical origin, potentially arising from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). In this work, we analyze the connection between the two phenomena in the case where they share a common origin: the collapse of large primordial curvature perturbations in the early universe. We focus on sub-solar PBH populations within reach of upcoming experiments, including the current and future runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA as well as the third generation observatories such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. Using a Bayesian framework with physically motivated priors, we perform a consistent model comparison that incorporates existing astrophysical bounds together with the discovery potential of future detectors. Our analysis lends stronger support for the SIGW interpretation over the astrophysical one, as the narrowed priors place greater weight on the region of highest likelihood. Ultimately, we illustrate that combining PTA data with interferometer searches can deliver correlated evidence for new physics across multiple gravitational-wave bands.

 - **Abstract**
 We present GammaPBHPlotter, a public Python code for calculating and plotting the Hawking radiation gamma-ray spectra of primordial black holes in the mass range of $10^{14}$ to $10^{18}$ grams. This tool allows users to compute the monochromatic and mass-averaged spectra of black holes over a range of parameters. We include the primary/direct Hawking emission, the secondary emission from the decay and hadronization of unstable particles, the final state radiation, and the in-flight annihilation gamma-ray emission components.

 - **Abstract**
 The growing number of gravitational-wave detections from binary black holes enables increasingly precise measurements of their population properties. The observed population is most likely drawn from multiple formation channels. Population-synthesis simulations allow detailed modelling of each of these channels, and comparing population-synthesis models with the observations allows us to constrain the uncertain physics of binary black hole formation and evolution. However, the most detailed population-synthesis codes are computationally expensive. We demonstrate the use of normalising flows to emulate five different population synthesis models, reducing the computational expense, and allowing interpolation between the populations predicted for different simulation inputs. With the trained normalising flows, we measure the branching ratios of different formation channels and details of binary stellar evolution, using the current catalogue of gravitational-wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 As a benchmark for galaxy evolution and dark matter studies, the total mass of the Milky Way is a parameter of cosmological significance, and its value at large radii from the Galactic center remains highly uncertain. Following a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach, we measure the cumulative mass of the Milky Way using full 6D phase-space information of stars from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We employ 330 blue horizontal-branch stars (BHBs) and 110 RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) in DESI covering Galactocentric distances in the range $\sim$50--100 kpc. Within 100 kpc from the Galactic center, we report an enclosed mass of $M(<100\ {\rm kpc}) = 0.57^{+0.08}_{-0.07}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and $M(<100\ {\rm kpc}) = 0.55^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ when using BHBs and RRLs, respectively. Extrapolating our mass profiles beyond the extent of our data, we find the virial mass of the Galaxy to be $M_{200}=0.85^{+0.16}_{-0.14}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ and $M_{200}=0.78^{+0.19}_{-0.15}\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$, respectively. We validate the effectiveness and limitations of our method using mock BHBs and RRLs from two AuriDESI halos. These tests show that the code recovers the enclosed mass of the mock galaxy with high precision and accuracy between 50 and 200 kpc, independent of the stellar tracer used and their spatial distribution. The tests also suggest an underestimation of the galaxy's cumulative mass at a level of up to $\sim20$\% if stars close to the Galactic center are used in the models. Our mass estimates lay the groundwork for future inference of the Galactic mass with upcoming DESI data releases and spectroscopic surveys mapping the halo.

#### Time-resolved protoplanetary disk physics in DQ Tau with JWST

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion variability is ubiquitous in YSOs. While large outbursts may strongly affect the disk, the effects of moderate bursts are less understood. We aim to study the physical response of the disk around the eccentric binary system DQ Tau to its periodic accretion changes. We organized a multi-wavelength campaign centered on four JWST/MIRI spectra. We targeted three periastrons (high accretion state) and one apastron (quiescence). We used optical and near-infrared spectroscopy and photometry to measure how the accretion luminosity varies. We decomposed the multi-epoch SEDs into stellar, accretion, and rim components. We fitted the solid-state features using various opacity curves and the molecular features using slab models. We find the inner disk of DQ Tau to be highly dynamic. The temperature, luminosity, and location of the inner dust rim vary in response to the movement of stars and the L_acc variations. This causes variable shadowing of the outer disk, leading to an anti-correlation between the rim temperature and the strength of the silicate feature. The dust mineralogy remains constant, dominated by large amorphous olivine and pyroxene grains, with smaller fractions of crystalline forsterite. The excitation of CO (1550-2260 K), HCN (880-980 K), and hot H2O (740-860 K) molecules as well as the luminosity of the [NeII] line correlate with the accretion rate, while the warm (650 K) and cold (170-200 K) H2O components are mostly constant. CO emission, originating from a hot (>1500 K) region likely within the dust sublimation radius, is most sensitive to L_acc changes. In comparison with other T Tauri disks, DQ Tau is highly C-poor and displays moderately inefficient pebble drift. We conclude that even moderate accretion rate changes affect the thermal structure in the planet-forming disk regions on short timescales, providing a crucial benchmark for understanding disk evolution.

#### Probe the missing baryons in cosmic filaments with Fast Radio Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic filaments are thought to host a substantial fraction of the missing baryons at redshifts $z<2$. In this study, we probe the baryonic content of these filaments using localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Filaments are identified from the galaxy distribution in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging surveys using the DisPerSe algorithm. We find tentative evidence ($\sim 3 \sigma$ significance) for a divergence in the relationship between the dispersion measure (DM) contributed by the intergalactic medium and redshift for FRBs whose signals intersect cosmic filaments compared to those that do not, suggesting excess baryons in the filamentary structures. Assuming an isothermal $\beta$-model gas profile with $\beta=2/3$, this discrepancy is best explained by a central baryon overdensity of $\delta = 20.78$, broadly consistent with previous simulation and observational results. The inferred baryon fraction residing in filaments decreases with redshift, from approximately $0.25-0.30\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.02$ to $0.15-0.30\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.5$, and $0.03-0.04\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.8$. These estimates are likely lower bounds, particularly at $z>0.5$, due to the limited number of identified filaments and localized FRBs at higher redshifts. We also examine various factors that may affect the statistical significance of our results. Our method offers an independent approach to tracing baryons in cosmic filaments and underscores the importance of expanding localized FRB samples and deepening galaxy surveys, which are key steps toward refining these estimates and addressing the missing baryon problem.

#### Constraining Ricci-Cubic Holographic Dark Energy from observational data using the MCMC sampling and enhanced Machine learning analysis

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19961

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19961

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we find constraints on the parameter space of the Ricci-Cubic Holographic dark energy (RCHDE) from various observational data sets like Hubble data, cosmic-chronometer data, Baryon-acoustic oscillation data, and also data from gamma-ray bursts. RCHDE is formed from the cubic invariant, which in turn is built from the cubic contractions of the Riemann and Ricci tensors. We have used the Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique to find constraints on the model parameters via Bayesian inference. Contour plots have been obtained for the model parameters, showing their marginalized and joint probability distributions. The best-fit regression lines are found for the constrained model and compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model to verify and validate the model. To complement this data analysis mechanism, we have also performed an enhanced machine learning analysis using observational Hubble parameter data. This approach serves to validate the model's predictive power through independent, data-driven regression techniques. Different graphical illustrations of the machine learning techniques have been presented to understand the results. These illustrations reveal a strong agreement between the Hubble parameter predictions from the machine learning models, the theoretical RCHDE model, and observational data.

#### Causal Viscous Fluids and Non-Singular Cosmological Bounces

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19310

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the realization of non-singular bouncing cosmologies driven by causal bulk-viscous fluids within General Relativity, $f(R)$ gravity, and Loop Quantum Cosmology. Building on the no-go result of Eckart theory in spatially flat universes, we show that the Israel--Stewart formulation, which incorporates finite relaxation times, permits controlled violations of the null energy condition at the bounce while remaining consistent with thermodynamic and causality requirements. Analytical bounce solutions are constructed from parametrized scale factors, yielding explicit constraints on the viscosity coefficient and relaxation time that guarantee positive entropy production and stable perturbations. In extended gravity frameworks, we demonstrate that higher-curvature corrections in $f(R)$ models and quantum geometry effects in Loop Quantum Cosmology further enhance the robustness of viscous bounces. Our results establish a unified description in which bulk viscosity provides a physically consistent mechanism for singularity resolution across different theories of gravity, highlighting distinctive conditions under which smooth cosmological bounces can occur.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical black holes are likely to be surrounded by various forms of matter in the form of disks or halos. While a number of studies have examined the impact of an environment on the lensing of light or gravitational waves from cosmological sources, these have, thus far, been carried out in either a Newtonian or post-Newtonian framework where the environment is superimposed on the black-hole spacetime. By using an exact solution in general relativity describing a black hole embedded within a realistic halo of Hernquist matter distribution, we study deflection angles and image amplification in a fully relativistic setup. It is shown that large ``bumps'' corresponding to the peak of the mass distribution can significantly adjust the inferences made for either the source or lens in various contexts. As an application, we consider ``echoes'' of gravitational waves, sourced by astrophysical lenses rather than being intrinsic to the compact object that produces the signal.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent gravitational-wave (GW) observations offer a unique opportunity to probe the fundamental nature of compact objects. A growing body of research has focused on exploring the role of dark matter (DM) through the concept of DM-admixed neutron stars (NSs), where the presence of DM can significantly alter key physical properties of NSs, such as their mass, radius, and tidal deformability, ultimately affecting the predicted GW waveform emitted during binary coalescences. In this work, we present a novel observational test that, for the first time, places constraints on the influence of DM inside NSs using real GW data. By reanalyzing signals from events such as GW230529, GW200115, and GW200105, we derive new upper bounds on the DM fraction, $F_{\chi}$, and particle mass, $m_{\chi}$, under the assumption that DM is described by a scalar field with a self-interaction potential. We find that the upper bound on $F_{\chi}$ depends on the specific binary system under analysis, indicating that different DM configurations can be consistent with observations in different ways. In particular, the event GW190814 may be compatible with a DM halo configuration. In contrast, the other events analyzed (GW230529, GW200105 and GW200115) are consistent with DM forming a core inside the NS, yielding strong upper bounds on $F_{\chi}$. The corresponding values for the mass scale $m_{\chi}$ are also discussed in the text. This work offers a new approach to probing DM in the context of compact NS objects through GW observations.

#### On the Chen-Teo family of stationary asymptotically locally Minkowskian black holes

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19415

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19415

 - **Abstract**
 Chen and Teo have constructed a two-parameter family of five dimensional, stationary vacuum black hole solutions whose spatial hypersurfaces are asymptotically locally Euclidean with boundary at infinity is $L(2,1)$. Spatial cross sections of the event horizon have topology $S^3$ equipped with inhomogeneous metrics. When the mass is zero, the solution reduces to the trivial product of time with the Eguchi-Hanson gravitational instanton. We show that the spacetime metric can be smoothly extended through an event horizon and that the exterior region is stably causal. We also investigate their geometric and physical properties. In particular, we show that the Smarr relation and first law of black hole mechanics hold and compute the renormalized gravitational action.

#### Greybody factors of Proca fields in Schwarzschild spacetime: A supplemental analysis based on decoupled master equations related to the Frolov-Krtouš-Kubizňák-Santos separation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19761

 - **Abstract**
 Greybody factors for Proca fields in Schwarzschild black hole spacetime are investigated. The radial equations are derived by separating the field equations using vector spherical harmonics and decoupling the even-parity sector through Frolov-Krtouš-Kubizňák-Santos transformation in the static limit. Semi-analytical methods, including a rigorous bound and the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation, are used to compute the transmission probabilities. In addition to reproducing known results, two distinctive features are identified. In the even-parity vector mode, a low-mass regime is found where the transmission probability exceeds that of the massless case for a set of common energy and angular momentum parameters. In the even-parity scalar mode, the massless limit reproduces the result of massless scalar perturbations and corresponds to a pure gauge mode in Maxwell theory. In the same mode, the transmission probability in the massive case is systematically lower than that of a massive scalar field with the same parameters.

#### Using normal to find abnormal: AI-based anomaly detection in gravitational wave data

 - **Abstract**
 The detection and classification of anomalies in gravitational wave data plays a critical role in improving the sensitivity of searches for signals of astrophysical origins. We present ABNORMAL (AI Based Nonstationarity Observer for Resectioning and Marking AnomaLies), a deep neural network (DNN) model for anomaly detection that is trained exclusively on simulated Gaussian noise. By removing dependence on real data for training, the method resolves a circular paradox in anomaly detection: training on real data implicitly involves prior segregation of stationary from non-stationary data but this is not possible unless all anomalies are detected first. ABNORMAL is an autoencoder-based DNN, commonly used in anomaly detection, with the key innovation that it is trained to predict statistical features of noise rather than reconstructing the noise time series themselves. The statistical features are obtained by applying Gabor and Wavelet filter banks, which implement time-frequency analysis, and are subsequently combined through multi-view fusion using a dual-path architecture. We quantify the performance of our method on simulated and real LIGO data. Application to data from the O1 to O3b observational runs uncovers a rich landscape of anomalies over different timescales, including many that do not fit within known classes.

#### The existence and upper bound for stable photon spheres in static spherically symmetric black holes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19823

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we establish the existence conditions and a universal upper bound on the radius of stable photon spheres (SPS) outside the event horizons of static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black holes surrounded by matter fields. We prove that stable photon spheres exist if the external matter satisfies specific conditions. Furthermore, under the additional assumption of a monotonically decreasing mass-radius ratio $m(r)/r^3$ outside the horizon, we derive a strict upper bound on the radius $r_{\mathrm{sps}}$ of any stable photon sphere: $r_{\mathrm{sps}}<6M$, where $M$ is the asymptotic mass of the black hole. This bound is independent of specific black hole solutions and broadly applies to hairy black holes and other configurations with external matter fields meeting the stated energy conditions. Our results resolve fundamental questions regarding the existence and spatial constraints on stable photon orbits, with implications for gravitational lensing, accretion disk dynamics (e.g., the Aschenbach effect), and black hole shadow observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational redshift is an important prediction of General Relativity (GR). We propose a novel dual one-way frequency comparison scheme for gravitational redshift tests in satellite-ground clock experiments. Unlike conventional triple-link Doppler cancellation methods, our approach requires only two optical links, an uplink and a downlink, with Doppler data recorded independently at the satellite and ground station, respectively. Crucially, coherent combination of these measurements suppresses first-order Doppler frequency shift to second order while doubling the gravitational redshift signal. This scheme reduced engineering complexity (50$\%$ fewer links) and amplified redshift sensitivity with a factor of 2 for satellite-ground clock comparison. The scheme's viability hinges on high-precision clock synchronization ($\leq$ 0.1 ns for $10^{-18}$ clock comparison), which is potentially achievable via state-of-the-art time-transfer techniques. Systematic error analysis confirms residual Doppler, atmospheric, and Shapiro shifts remain below $10^{-17}$ for optimized orbits, establishing this scheme as a useful tool for probing fundamental physics beyond GR.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19912

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the Teleparallel Robertson-Walker (TRW) $F(T)$ gravity solutions for a Chaplygin gas, and then for any polytropic gas cosmological source. We use the TRW $F(T)$ gravity field equations (FEs) for each $k$-parameter value case and the relevant gas equation of state (EoS) to find the new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. For flat $k=0$ cosmological case, we find analytical solutions valid for any cosmological scale factor. For curved $k=\pm 1$ cosmological cases, we find new approximated teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for slow, linear, fast and very fast universe expansion cases summarizing by a double power-law function. All the new solutions will be relevant for future cosmological applications on dark matter, dark energy (DE) quintessence, phantom energy, Anti-deSitter (AdS) spacetimes and several other cosmological processes.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in the framework of spatially covariant gravity (SCG), a broad class of Lorentz-violating modified gravity theories respecting only spatial diffeomorphism invariance. Extending earlier SCG formulations, we compute the general kernel function for SIGWs on a flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker background, focusing on polynomial-type SCG Lagrangians up to $d=3$, where $d$ denotes the total number of derivatives in each monomial. We derive explicit expressions for the kernel in the case of power-law time evolution of the coefficients, and restrict attention to the subset of SCG operators whose tensor modes propagate at the speed of light, thereby avoiding late-time divergences in the fractional energy density of SIGWs. Instead of the usual Newtonian gauge, the breaking of time reparametrization symmetry in SCG necessitates a unitary gauge analysis. We compute the energy density of SIGWs for representative parameter combinations, finding distinctive deviations from general relativity (GR), including scale-dependent modifications to both the amplitude and the spectral shape. Our results highlight the potential of stochastic GW background measurements to probe spatially covariant gravity and other Lorentz-violating extensions of GR.

 - **Abstract**
 We search for nearly-monochromatic gravitational wave signals with frequencies $800.0~\textrm{Hz} \leq f \leq 1686.0~\textrm{Hz}$ and spin-down $-2.7\times10^{-9}~\textrm{Hz}\,\textrm{s}^{-1} \leq \dot f \leq 0.2\times 10^{-9}~\textrm{Hz}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}$. We use LIGO O3 public data from the Hanford and Livingston detectors and deploy this search on the Einstein@Home volunteer-computing project. This is the most sensitive search carried out to date in this parameter space. Our results are consistent with a non-detection. We set upper limits on the gravitational wave amplitude $h_{0}$ and translate these to upper limits on neutron star ellipticity and on r-mode amplitude. The most stringent upper limits are at $800~\textrm{Hz}$ with $h_{0} = 1.32\times10^{-25}$, at the $90\%$ confidence level. Searching in the high frequency bands allows us to probe astrophysically interesting ellipticities with our results excluding isolated neutron stars rotating faster than $2.5~\textrm{ms}$ with ellipticities $\epsilon \geq 1.96 \times 10^{-8}\left[\frac{d}{100~\textrm{pc}}\right]$ within a distance $d$ from Earth. Our results also exclude r-mode amplitudes $\alpha \geq 7 \times 10^{-7}\left[\frac{d}{100~\textrm{pc}}\right]$ for neutron stars stars spinning faster than 400 Hz.
