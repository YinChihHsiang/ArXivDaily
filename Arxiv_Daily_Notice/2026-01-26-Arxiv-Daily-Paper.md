#### Calibration-independent consistency test of BAO and SNIa data: update

 - **Abstract**
 In a recent paper, arXiv:2509.19899, we presented a new method to test the consistency between uncalibrated BAO and SNIa data through a common parameter, the Alcock-Paczynski variable. Using Gaussian Processes, we can determine if various datasets are consistent, independently of dark energy or modified gravity models, and of the sound horizon and SNIa peak magnitude. We found that the DES-Y5 SNIa data showed non-negligible tension with other datasets. However, the recent update DES-Dovekie removes this tension. We find that all uncalibrated data from DESI DR2 BAO and three SNIa datasets, Union3, Pantheon+, and DES-Dovekie, are consistent with each other within $\sim 1\sigma$.

 - **Abstract**
 The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration produced the first image of the apparent shadow of the central black hole of Sagittarius\,A$^*$ (\sgra). \sgra source structure varies significantly on timescales shorter than the duration of an observation, preventing improved data coverage through Earth rotation aperture synthesis. This rapid variability provides the opportunity to quantify intrinsic variability and separate time-variable emission features from stable signatures of strong gravity and the accretion environment. To infer the properties \sgra and its surrounding accretion flow, we perform Bayesian inference on a series of EHT data segments (``snapshots''). We directly fit parameters of a semi-analytic emission model jointly with complex station gains to snapshot visibilities, then extract estimates of the time-averaged, persistent source structure and temporal variability by stacking snapshots in a Bayesian hierarchical model. This approach successfully reproduces parameters of General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics simulations using synthetic EHT observations. Even with physically motivated assumptions about the \sgra environment, black hole spin and magnetic field parameters are poorly constrained by 2017 EHT observations. Our inference constrains other parameters, favoring a nearly face-on observer inclination ($\theta_{\rm o} = 9.2\degree \pm 3.6 \degree \pm_{\rm v} 11.6\degree$), an emission peak near the horizon ($R_{\rm peak} = 4.9 \pm 0.1 \pm_{\rm v} 0.5\,GM/c^2$), near-vertical projected spin position angle ($p.a. = 7.3\degree \pm 7.08 \degree \pm_{\rm v} 43.5\degree$ counterclockwise from vertical), and dominant emission $43.4\degree \pm 2.0\degree \pm_{\rm v} 5.9\degree$ above the equatorial plane, where we separate average structure uncertainty ($\pm$) from the impacts of temporal variability and model misspecification ($\pm_{\rm v}$).

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first sample of 222 high-redshift (z>0.5) star clusters, detected with JWST/NIRCam in 78 magnified galaxies from different galaxy cluster fields. The majority of the systems (~60%) is observed in the very deep NIRCam observations of the cluster AbellS1063 (GLIMPSE program), showing the power that deep observations, combined with lensing, has to reveal these primordial stellar structures. We perform simultaneous size-flux estimates in all available NIRCam filters and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis to recover star cluster physical properties. All star cluster candidates have very high magnification. Star clusters and clumps show similar ages and redshift distributions, although noticeable differences are seen in their masses, sizes and stellar surface densities inherent to the lack of resolution in the latter group. We reconstruct the formation redshift of star clusters and find that the large majority of the observed star clusters show young ages (<100 Myr) and seems to form at cosmic noon (CN,1<z<4). A small sample of CN star clusters is about 1 Gyr old, these potential globular clusters have formed well within cosmic reionization. Star clusters have stellar densities in the range 10^2 to 10^6 M/pc^2, with median values around 10^4 pc2. Their sizes and densities better overlap with those of nuclear star clusters in the local Universe. These intrinsic properties make high-z star clusters a viable channel to grow intermediate mass black holes. We use Bayesian inference to make first direct measurement of the star cluster mass function at z>1, based on a subsample of 60 star clusters younger than 100 Myr and with masses above 2e6 Msun. The star cluster mass function is well described by a power-law with slope beta = -1.89 suggesting that a power-law -2 function might already be in place in the distant Universe.

#### A differential-geometry approach to black hole characterization of megamaser systems in static spherically symmetric spacetimes

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16308

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16308

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a geometry-first model that maps measured thin-disk water megamaser observables--sky angles, frequency shifts, their secular drifts and the angular redshift rate--to the black hole parameters in a generic static, spherically symmetric (SSS) spacetime written in the Schwarzschild gauge. The core of the approach is local: dot-product relations in the equatorial curved geometry relate the conserved light-deflection parameter to the observed detector angle at finite distance, providing a connection between sky positions and photon constants of motion. These local identities feed a closed model for the frequency shift of photons traveling between a maser clump circularly orbiting a black hole and a finite-distance detector, making explicit the dependence on the metric at emission and detection radii. We also apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to this construction on the equatorial two-manifold as an intrinsic cross-check. This theorem provides a global consistency relation between the local emission and detection angles, helping to validate sign conventions and angle branch choices in the local setup. In this sense, the local and global perspectives on the megamaser system support each other. To supplement the instantaneous information contained in frequency shifts, we incorporate the time-domain general relativistic invariant, the redshift rapidity. We further introduce a prospective angular-domain observable, the angular redshift rate, and give its analytic expression in the SSS framework. The results are formulated for generic SSS backgrounds, providing closed relations suited for likelihood-based inference from VLBI positions and spectral monitoring. In particular, for a Schwarzschild background, the black hole mass, its distance to Earth and megamaser orbital radius are fully constrained in the language of astrophysical observables.

#### Hot, Retrograde Tilted MADs: Misaligned, Precessing, and Shaped by Electromagnetic Torques

 - **Abstract**
 Tilted accretion disks in the magnetically arrested (MAD) state may be present in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei such as Sgr A* and M87. We have carried out 3D global GRMHD simulations to study the evolution of these accretion flows as a function of black hole spin and misalignment angle. Prograde MADs align with the spin through a two-stage process: an initial rapid alignment phase that operates on the magnetic flux saturation timescale, followed by a slower, spin-independent phase. In contrast, retrograde MADs remain persistently misaligned regardless of the black hole spin, displaying solid-body precession at rates four times higher than weakly magnetized flows at the same spin magnitude. By deriving torque equations in ideal GRMHD and evaluating them in a frame aligned with instantaneous disk orientation, we demonstrate that electromagnetic (EM) torques always act to align the disk with the BH spin, but are countered by opposing hydrodynamic fluxes in retrograde flows. We further develop a preliminary empirical model to explain the cause of two-stage prograde alignment and discuss the possibility of alignment in the retrograde MAD. Strongly magnetized, retrograde, misaligned accretion disks provide a candidate scenario for the low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations in black hole X-ray binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The success of an astronomical facility is measured by its scientific impact. A principal metric for this impact is the ensemble of peer-reviewed publications based on the observational data obtained by the facility. We present a comprehensive study of the statistics of the 4,190 refereed publications of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the period from 2012 to 2024. The publications have received 169,985 citations and are based on 2,670 ALMA projects totalling 19,265 hours of 12-m-array-equivalent observing time. Our study analyses publication statistics related to various aspects, e.g. science categories, geographical distribution, archival research, time to publication, publication fraction, and citations. We also look into the community and compare ALMA with other facilities. We find that ALMA is a high-impact observatory with an average of 41 citations per publication, ~70% of observed projects published, ~40% of publications making use of archival data in 2024, more than 9,400 unique authors, and a publication evolution following that of HST and VLT. Currently, the impact factor for ALMA publications is larger than that of all other major astronomical facilities. ALMA also plays a pivotal role in very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), substantially contributing to landmark achievements such as capturing the first image of a black hole shadow.

#### When Primordial Black Holes Absorb During the Early Universe

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16717

 - **Abstract**
 We study the evolution of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe in the presence of a surrounding thermal bath. By incorporating the effects of thermal absorption, we show that PBHs can undergo significant mass growth, leading to extended lifetimes and substantial deviations from the standard Hawking evaporation scenario. We find a critical collapse efficiency, $\gamma_{\rm c} \simeq 0.395$, above which the PBH mass grows without bound. This correction has profound implications for both PBH-induced reheating and dark matter (DM) production. Specifically, we find that the reheating temperature can be suppressed, and the DM parameter space for the PBH reheating scenario can undergo $\mathcal{O}(10)$-$\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ corrections, depending on the PBH formation mass and collapse efficiency. Moreover, our results significantly shift the parameter space in which PBHs can account for the entirety of the DM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive phenomenological study to incorporate thermal absorption into PBH evolution and quantify its impact on cosmological observables.

#### A more inclusive effective dark fluid equation of state parameter: constraints from SKA and Euclid like surveys

 - **Abstract**
 We forecast constraints on an effective dark fluid equation of state parameter $w_{\rm eff}$ that encapsulates modified gravity theories that modifies both the Universe background expansion as well as its large scale structures growth. This is achieved through relating Friedmann equations' dark fluid pressure and density content, thus $w_{\rm eff}$, to modified gravity parameterized models by mean of the Newtonian potential equation parameter $\mu_0$, the gravitational slip parameter $\eta_0$ and a redshift dependent Hubble parameter $H_{0,{\rm bck}}$. We adopt next stage SKA survey specifications, alone or in combination with concurrently expected DR3 Euclid survey release, paying attention to the modeling and recipe of the implementation of the galaxy clustering and lensing probes obtained from the two surveys. We consider two data mock models: one with deviation of the intermediate parameters at the level of 10 \% (yielding however $w_{\rm eff}=-1.03$) and another sub-percently close to $\Lambda$CDM. We found that the three parameters deviation from $\Lambda$CDM could only be detected at 1 $\sigma$ from SKA alone, while this improves to $\sim$ 2 $\sigma$ when we combine with Euclid. An improvement of the order of 30\% on the bounds is reached after projecting the three parameters into a single $w_{\rm eff}$ parameter. However, this affects both cases and thus it does not change much, though it improves the level of detection with respect to $\Lambda$CDM values. We conclude that synergy from both surveys benefits to tighten our constraints, but also that our highly generalized parameterization, although impacting at both the background and the perturbation level, will be hard to disentangle from $\Lambda$CDM at the level at which our forecast is performed and it still needs, to the least, data from more advanced stages of the adopted surveys to hope reach this target.

#### The shape function of the observed growth index

 - **Abstract**
 The growth index $\gamma$ is a powerful trigger for detecting deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. However, its value is often determined by considering an asymptotic constant value that works for all redshift, or else following a chosen parameterisation. Here we formulate the growth index as function of three quantities that could be directly related to observables in redshift bins, $f\sigma_8(z_i)$, $f(z_i)$ and $H(z_i)$. We determine its value and its derivative at observed nodal center of redshift bins and use the shape function method, after showing insightful connection with its underlying governing virtual-work conservation principle, to construct a redshift dependence of the $\gamma$ without assuming a specific parameterization. We then use the resulting shape function to test if we can disentangle between different scenarios where there are discrepancies between its three constituent measured components. We also tested whether it can be used to rule out models of modified gravity, or extended parametric models of the growth index that capture more general behaviors with an additional parameter as function of the scale factor or dark energy. Adopting forecasted measurements from next generation surveys on the three quantities used to construct $\gamma$, we find that reported discrepancies between them could be detected with our method, but at the bins where the errors and lost of precision from our addition of degrees of freedom is small with respect to the deviation of $\gamma$. The same could be concluded for first order extensions to $\gamma$ or common modified gravity models, and to a lesser degree for dynamical dark energy models after supposing the latest DESI values. We conclude that this method is a strong tool to investigate cosmology in a model-independent way especially with forthcoming data delivered by further stage-IV surveys with more stringent uncertainties.(Abridged)

#### ReveaLLAGN 1: JWST Emission-Line Spectra Reveal Low-Luminosity AGN with UV-Deficient SEDs and Warm Molecular Gas

 - **Abstract**
 We present near- and mid-infrared spectra of eight Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei (LLAGN), spanning nearly four orders of magnitude in black hole mass and Eddington ratio, obtained with JWST/NIRSpec and MIRI as part of the ReveaLLAGN program along with identical archival data of Cen A. The high spatial resolution of JWST cleanly separates AGN emission from host-galaxy contamination, enabling detections of high-ionization potential lines more than an order of magnitude fainter than previously measured. Emission-line diagnostics reveal a transition at log($L_{bol}/L_{Edd}$) ~ -3.5, where the spectral energy distribution becomes increasingly deficient in ultraviolet photons. We find that rotational H$_2$ excitation temperatures are elevated (~500 K higher) compared to both higher-luminosity AGN and star-forming galaxies, while the H$_2$(0-0)S(3)/PAH$_{11.3 \mu m}$ ratios are consistent with those observed in the AGN population. We discuss the possible roles of outflows, jets, and X-ray dominated regions in shaping the interstellar medium surrounding LLAGN. Silicate emission at ~10 $\mu$m, localized to the nuclear region, is detected in most ReveaLLAGN targets. This dataset offers the first comprehensive JWST-based characterization of infrared emission lines in the nuclear regions of LLAGN.

#### Bayesian Inference of Neutron Star Properties in $f(Q)$ Gravity Using NICER Observations

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate neutron stars (NSs) in the strong field regime within the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity, considering three representative models: linear, logarithmic, and exponential. While Bayesian studies of NS observations are well established in General Relativity and curvature based modified gravity theories, such analyses in $f(Q)$ gravity remain largely unexplored. We perform a Bayesian inference analysis by confronting theoretical NS mass-radius predictions with NICER observations of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0437+4715, and PSR J0614+3329. The dense matter equation of state is fixed to DDME2 in order to isolate the effects of modified gravity on NS structure. Our results show that the exponential $f(Q)$ model is statistically preferred over the linear and logarithmic cases, as confirmed by Bayes factor comparisons, and exhibits well-constrained. For this model, we obtain a radius and tidal deformability at $1.4\,M_\odot$ of $R_{1.4} = 11.27^{+0.53}_{-0.36}\,\mathrm{km}$ and $\Lambda_{1.4} = 156.95^{+84.02}_{-41.73}$, respectively, consistent with current observational constraints. These results highlight the potential of NSs as powerful probes of symmetric teleparallel gravity in the strong field regime.

#### Static hairy black hole in 4D General Relativity

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16254

 - **Abstract**
 In four-dimensional vacuum general relativity the only known static, exact and analytical black hole solution is given by the Schwarzschild spacetime. In this paper this renowned metric is generalised by adding another integrating constant, a hair that switches the metric from the Petrov type D to the type I. This new parameter represents the intensity of an external gravitational field, which can be considered the hyperbolic generalisation of the Witten's bubble of nothing. No curvature or conical singularities are present outside the event horizon. The no hair arguments are circumvented because the metric is not asymptotically flat, and neither the black hole is spherical. The gravitational hair continuously deforms the Schwarzschild geometry: the horizon becomes oblate, while its area is reduced. Conserved charges and thermodynamic properties of the black hole are studied.

#### Light propagation and quasinormal modes of a topologically charged Schwarzschild-Klinkhamer wormhole

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16305

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of null geodesics, critical photon orbits, and shadow formation associated with a wormhole generated by a geometric defect. The propagation of light in this spacetime is examined through the deflection angle in both weak- and strong-field regimes. Analytical expansions are derived in each regime and employed to characterize gravitational lensing observables. By varying the global monopole charge, we evaluate its impact on these observables and determine parameter ranges that may be accessible to current or future observational probes. Finally, we calculate the quasinormal modes as well as the time-domain solution for scalar perturbations as well.

#### Gravitational Lensing Effect from The Revised Deser-Woodard Nonlocal Gravity

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16572

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the gravitational lensing effects of a static spherically symmetric black hole (BH) within the framework of the revised Deser-Woodard (D-W) nonlocal gravity. By analyzing the deflection angle in both the weak and strong field limits, we derive several distinguishing features of the model. In the weak field limit, we report a leading-order correction to the deflection angle directly attributed to the non-local nature of the theory. In the strong field limit, we find that the lensing corrections are almost linearly dependent on the coupling parameter $\zeta$ while being exponentially suppressed by the exponent parameter $n$. Furthermore, the gravitational lensing effect in the revised D-W model at a given time shares similar scale-invariant behavior to General Relativity and conformal gravity, offering a potential pathway to distinguish it from other alternatives using astronomical observations.

#### Anisotropy Strikes Back: Modified Gravity and Dark Matter Halos

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16958

 - **Abstract**
 We explore dark matter like fluids in a spherically symmetric Lemaitre Tolman Bondi (LTB) minisuperspace, tracking how symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian constraint control the emergence of effective dark sources in General Relativity (GR) and Horava Lifshitz (HL) gravity. We first deform the GR Hamiltonian by adding an extra weight $+1$ density to the potential. We show that potential deformations of this type leave the (reduced) Dirac algebra unchanged and the modification is naturally reinterpreted as an effective anisotropic stress energy contribution. While the fluid reproduces an isothermal-like mass scaling, its pressure anisotropy prevents it from giving flat rotation curves. We then turn to HL gravity, where the deformed Dirac algebra induces a controlled nonconservation law for an emergent dust component. Generalizing earlier results, we identify a restricted class of LTB backgrounds for which the HL source term yields a positive scaling dark matter density, consistent with ghost-freedom, and recovery of GR in the infrared. The analysis is conditional on a prescribed background: obtaining a fully backreacted areal radius solution consistent with the HL field equations is left as a natural direction for future work.

#### Conservative Black Hole Scattering at Fifth Post-Minkowskian and Second Self-Force Order

 - **Abstract**
 Using the worldline quantum field theory formalism, we compute the conservative scattering angle and impulse for classical black hole scattering at fifth post-Minkowskian (5PM) order by providing the second self-force (2SF) contributions. This four-loop calculation involves non-planar Feynman integrals and requires advanced integration-by-parts reduction, novel differential-equation strategies, and efficient boundary-integral algorithms to solve a system of hundreds of master integrals in four integral families on high-performance computing systems. The resulting function space includes multiple polylogarithms as well as iterated integrals with a K3 period, which generate a spurious velocity divergence at $v/c=\sqrt{8}/3$. This divergence is present in the potential region and must be cancelled by conservative memory contributions from radiative regions. We find that the standard use of Feynman propagators to access the conservative sector fails to ensure this cancellation. We propose a conservative propagator prescription which realises both cancellations leading to a physically sensible answer. All available low-velocity checks of our result against the post-Newtonian literature are satisfied.

#### BRST methods for constructing quartic actions for spinning black holes

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16452

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16452

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a systematic approach to the computation of gauge invariant quartic interactions between reducible massive and massless higher spin fields. Extending the BRST formulation of existing cubic results, we obtain a single constraint for each off-shell quartic vertex that ensures both the gauge invariance of the Lagrangian and associativity of the gauge transformations at quartic order. A solution to these equations is presented. The general equation is then reduced to an on-shell version to reduce complexity. We find example solutions for the off-shell and on-shell quartic vertices in low spin examples relevant to the problem of black hole scattering.

#### Universality of Dissipation across Holographic Interfaces

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by recent results in spin chains we study dissipation and relaxation in a two-dimensional holographic interface conformal field theory (ICFT) in which degrees of freedom on one side of the interface are coupled to an external bath, while the other side remains isolated. In the bulk description this setup is realized by gluing a supersymmetric Janus geometry to a BTZ black hole region, with the coupling implemented through a double-trace deformation. We determine the quasinormal modes in the bulk by solving the double-trace matching conditions of the system and bath. The lowest imaginary part of the modes defines a Liouvillian gap, and following earlier work in spin chains we introduce the dimensionless ratio crelax as a measure of interface-induced suppression of relaxation. Numerically we find that, crelax is independent of coupling details to the bath. It is a strong candidate for a universal interface observable characterizing dissipation and relaxation across the interface.
