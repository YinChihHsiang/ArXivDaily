 - **Abstract**
 The direct imaging of black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) enables precision tests of gravity in the strong-field regime. We investigate the cosmological evolution and optical appearance of black holes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity coupled with Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy (KHDE). Utilizing Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) datasets, we constrain model parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. Results indicate that the late-time universe statistically favors a phantom-like equation of state ($c \approx 0.704$). Regarding the EGB coupling $\alpha$, although data favor a positive value, the parameter space permits negative values down to a theoretical stability cut-off at $\alpha \approx -0.03$. While the best-fit suggests deviation, results remain consistent with General Relativity ($\alpha=0$) within the $2\sigma$ confidence level. Based on these constraints, we model the secular mass accretion history (treating accretion efficiency as a phenomenological constant) and compute the shadow radius evolution. We find that in a realistic dispersive plasma environment, refractive effects significantly mask intrinsic gravitational and dark energy signatures, causing global shadow shrinkage. Nevertheless, a characteristic systematic intrinsic deviation of $\sim 1\%$--$1.5\%$ (under a conservative accretion scenario) persists at redshifts $z \lesssim 1.5$ relative to standard $\Lambda$CDM predictions. These findings suggest that despite environmental dominance, precise statistical analyses of shadow populations could disentangle these subtle dynamic dark energy signals from the standard cosmological paradigm.

 - **Abstract**
 During a tidal disruption event (TDE) the stream debris inherits the magnetic field of the star. As the stream stretches, the magnetic field evolves and can eventually become dynamically important. We study this effect by means of magnetohydrodynamic simulations and a semi-analytic model of the disruption of a main-sequence star by a supermassive black hole. For stellar magnetic fields stronger than $\sim 10^4\,\rm{G}$, magnetic pressure becomes important in a significant fraction of the mass of the stream, leading to a fast increase in its thickness, an effect that may impact its subsequent evolution. We find that this dynamical effect is associated with a phase of transverse equilibrium between magnetic and tidal forces, which causes the stream width to increase with distance to the black hole as $H \propto R^{5/4}$. In the unbound tail, this fast expansion could enhance the radio emission produced by the interaction with the ambient medium, while in the returning stream, it may qualitatively affect the subsequent gas evolution, particularly the gas dynamics and radiative properties of shocks occurring after the stream's return to pericentre. By characterizing the magnetohydrodynamic properties of the stream from disruption to the first return to pericentre, this work provides physically motivated initial conditions for future studies of the later phases of TDEs, accounting for magnetic fields. This will ultimately shed light on the role of magnetic fields in enabling angular momentum transport in the ensuing accretion disk, thereby affecting observable signatures such as X-ray radiation and relativistic outflows.

#### Little Red Dots host Black Hole Stars: A unified family of gas-reddened AGN revealed by JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 We use the DAWN JWST Archive to construct and characterise a sample of 116 little red dots (LRDs) across 2.3<z<9.3, selecting all sources with v-shaped UV-optical continua from NIRSpec/PRISM spectra and compact morphologies in NIRCam/F444W imaging. We show that LRD continuum spectra are ubiquitously well described by modified blackbodies across ~$0.4-1.0\mu$m, with typical T~5000K or $\lambda_{peak}$~$0.65\mu$m across 2 dex in luminosity, and a tail toward T~2000K. LRDs therefore trace a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram that is directly analogous to stars on the Hayashi track, strongly supporting the picture that LRDs are AGN embedded in thermalised dense gas envelopes in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium. Hotter LRDs with $\lambda_{peak}<0.65\mu$m typically have strong Balmer breaks, redder UV slopes and high optical luminosities; other LRDs show weak or no Balmer breaks, and wide variety in $\beta_{UV}$ and $L_{5100}$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the UV-optical continuum shapes and luminosities are strongly linked to the $H\alpha,\ H\beta$, [OIII] and OI line properties. There is a tight linear relation between the H$\alpha$ and optical continuum luminosities, as well as H$\alpha$ and OI$_{8446}$, indicating that Balmer, OI and optical emission must primarily be powered by the same source. The Balmer decrement increases strongly toward higher $L_{H\alpha}$, $L_{5100}$ and Balmer break strength, providing key evidence for luminosity-dependent effects of collisional (de-)excitation and resonant scattering in the gaseous envelopes. In contrast, we show that [OIII] emission likely originates from star-forming host galaxies, and that its strong correlation with Balmer break strength arises naturally from variation in the AGN-to-host ratio. Our work presents an empirical description of the nature and structure of LRDs, defining a new benchmark for ongoing LRD model developments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the value-added catalogue JOLINES (J-PAS optical line intensities for nebular emission galaxies), which provides emission-line fluxes in galaxies at from the spectrophotometric catalogues of miniJPAS, J-NEP and the J-PAS early data release (EDR). This catalogue will be updated with future data releases, offering a growing resource for the study of emission-line galaxies. To obtain reliable emission-line fluxes from narrow-band photometry, we employed spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using CIGALE, a robust tool that reconstructs the continuum emission and ensures accurate flux measurements. This method effectively mitigates uncertainties associated with direct continuum subtraction techniques, and systematics such as absorption components in the emission lines. We validate our approach using simulated observations of galaxy spectra with added noise, testing the method's performance across different equivalent width (EW) regimes and emission-line strengths. Additionally, we compare the recovered emission-line fluxes with spectroscopic measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our results show a tight correlation between photometric and spectroscopic fluxes, particularly for bright emission lines, with a typical dispersion of $\sim$0.3 dex. Reliable fluxes are obtained for emission lines with EW $\gtrsim20\, \rm{\mathring{A}}$, in agreement with previous empirical studies. The current catalogue comprises approximately 13,900 sources with reliable flux measurements in the H$\alpha$+[NII] complex and 7,200 in [OIII]$\lambda 5007$, ensuring statistically robust samples for the brightest optical emission lines. This resource will be expanded in future J-PAS releases, facilitating large-scale studies of star formation, AGN activity, and galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first comprehensive study of astrometric microlensing by exotic astrophysical dark objects, focusing on two theoretically motivated models -- Q-ball and boson star. We demonstrate that these extended objects generate distinctive signatures that depart markedly from point-mass lenses like primordial black holes. The smoking-gun signature for these exotic objects is the emergence of caustics, which form when the lens radius is below a critical threshold. Crossing these caustics induces discontinuous jumps in the images-centroid trajectory, a distinctive feature of these extended dark objects. We show these patterns are sensitive to the internal mass profile, with boson stars generating larger, more prominent caustic structures than Q-balls -- enabling the models to be distinguished. Using the Gaia DR3 stellar catalogue, we forecast a high-yield discovery potential, up to $\sim 6000$ detectable astrometric microlensing events for a 10-year mission, peaking for $M \sim 1-10~M_\odot$ and $R \lesssim 10~\text{AU}$. In the absence of anomalous detections, Gaia can set powerful 90% confidence level constraints on the fractional abundance of these exotic objects, reaching $f_{\mathrm{DM}} \le 10^{-3}$ in the peak region which covers masses from $10^{-1}-10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ and radii $R<10^{6}~\text{AU}$. Crucially, these projected astrometric microlensing constraints are significantly stronger than existing photometric microlensing limits in the $1-10~M_\odot$ mass range. This work establishes astrometric microlensing with Gaia as a powerful, complementary, and near-future probe with the potential to discover exotic astrophysical dark objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the astrophysical origins of binary black holes requires accurate and flexible modeling of multi-dimensional population properties. In this paper, using a data-driven framework based on binned Gaussian processes, we characterize the joint distribution of BBH primary masses, mass ratios, and effective inspiral spins. We identify three distinct subpopulations in the GWTC-4 sample of observations and investigate their astrophysical origins. We find that only one of the three subpopulations exhibits the $35M_{\odot}$ peak, which is characterized by a strong preference for equal mass systems and isotropic spin orientations. Our inferred distributions are consistent with a predominantly dynamical origin of this feature. By comparing with theoretical simulations, we further show that the subpopulation that exhibits the $35M_{\sun}$ peak can exclusively comprise dynamically assembled systems in globular clusters, specifically if black hole birth spins are in the range~$(0.1-0.2)$, whereas the other two subpopulations require substantial contributions from alternative formation channels. We constrain the \textit{lower bound} on the merger rate of BBHs in globular clusters to be $0.69^{+0.23}_{-0.33} \rm{Gpc}^{-3}\rm{yr}^{-1}$, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. We conclude that dynamical formation in globular clusters remains a strong candidate for the origin of this excess near $30-40M_{\odot}$ and that more data and targeted parametric models are necessary to rigorously establish this interpretation.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents the design and testing of a millimeter-wave frequency comb generator developed for the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) mission, a space Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) mission concept. The heart of BHEX is a dual-band receiver, centered at 90 and 270 GHz. This novel comb generator is based on a microwave phase modulator producing phase-coherent comb signals with multi-octave bandwidth, which will be used to track instrumental delays when injected into the receiver system. The comb generator was tested with astronomical receivers, which confirms its expected operation.

#### Clustering in dynamical dark energy: observational constraints from DESI, CMB, and supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the clustering properties of dynamical dark energy using the latest cosmological observations. We describe the dark energy perturbation within two complementary frameworks, namely the Parameterized Post-Friedmann (PPF) approach and the Effective Field Theory (EFT) of dark energy. Using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations together with Planck 2018 CMB data and the Union3 supernova sample, we constrain the effective sound speed of dark energy in both the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM backgrounds. Within the PPF description, the sound speed remains unconstrained for $w$CDM, while for the $w_0w_a$CDM case we obtain $\log_{10} c_s^2 = -3.00^{+2.9}_{-0.99}$. Additionally, in the EFT framework, both models favor a small sound speed, with a mean value $c_s^2 \simeq 0.3$--$0.4$ but with significant uncertainties. For dynamical dark energy, the reconstructed equation of state clearly exhibits a quintom-B behavior, and its deviation from $\Lambda$CDM reaches $3.42\sigma$, rising to $3.63\sigma$ when PPF perturbations are included and reducing to $3.19\sigma$ in the EFT case. Finally, model comparison using information criteria shows that the $w_0w_a$CDM model with a smooth, non-clustering dark energy component ($c_s^2 = 1$) is preferred by AIC, whereas BIC favors $\Lambda$CDM. In summary, current data indicate a mild preference for dynamical dark energy but no evidence for significant clustering, which implies the need for future high-precision observations to probe the perturbative behavior more definitively.

#### Robust evidence for dynamical dark energy in light of DESI DR2 and joint ACT, SPT, and Planck data

 - **Abstract**
 Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements released by DESI, when combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and type Ia supernova (SN) data, suggest a significant preference for dynamical dark energy (DDE) that exhibits the phantom-like behavior in the past and has transitioned into quintessence-like behavior today. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of six representative DDE parametrization models by utilizing the latest and most precise CMB data jointly from ACT, SPT, and Planck, in conjunction with BAO data from DESI DR2 and SN data from DESY5, PantheonPlus, and Union3. Our overall analysis indicates that the preference for DDE in the Quintom-B regime remains robust, regardless of the DDE parameterization model and the data combination employed. The trend of this preference is significantly strengthened with the support of DESY5 SN data. Specifically, when using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, for the Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.785 \pm 0.047$ and $w_a = -0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, which significantly deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM values and provide evidence for DDE at the $4.2\sigma$ level. By the reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$, normalized dark energy density $f_{\mathrm{DE}}(z)$, and the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, we also observe clear departures from $\Lambda$CDM, further reinforcing the case for DDE. Furthermore, the Bayesian evidence analysis indicates that the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, BA and Exponential models are moderately favored relative to $\Lambda$CDM based on the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data.

#### Spiral excitation in protoplanetary disks through gap-edge illumination: Distinctive kinematic signatures in CO isotopologues

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution, near-infrared observations have revealed prominent, two-armed spirals in a multitude of systems, such as MWC~758, SAO~206462, and V1247~Ori. Alongside the classical theory of disk-companion interaction, shadow-based driving has come into vogue as a potential explanation for such large-scale substructures. How might these two mechanisms be distinguished from one another in observations? To investigate this question, we ran a pair of hydrodynamical simulations with \texttt{PLUTO}. One, with full radiation hydrodynamics and gas-grain collision, was designed to develop shadow-driven spirals at the outer gap edge of a sub-thermal, Saturn-mass planet. The other, with parametrized $\beta$-cooling, was set up to capture the more standard view of spiral wave excitation by a super-thermal, multi-Jupiter-mass, exterior planetary companion. Post-processing of these simulations with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) code \texttt{RADMC3D} revealed that strong vertical velocities in the shadow-driven case create a prominent two-armed feature in the moment-1 CO maps, particularly when the disk is viewed face-on in optically thicker isotopologues; such a feature is not seen in the standard planet-driven case. Conversely, the presence or absence of such signatures in two-armed spiral systems would distinguish those potentially driven by exterior, multi-Jupiter-mass companions, and thus help identify promising targets for future direct-imaging campaigns.

#### Cosmology of axion dark energy in supersymmetric models and constraints on high scale parameters

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.22559

 - **Abstract**
 An analysis is given of interacting dark energy and dark matter where the dark energy is assumed to be an ultralight axionic field with a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson potential which is in general a superposition of $N$ number of cosine terms motivated by supergravity and string models with a $U(1)$ global symmetry, where the symmetry is broken by instanton effects. The case $N=2$ is investigated in detail and a fit to cosmological data is performed where it is found that a better fit is obtained in comparison with the $N=1$ case. The fits also constrain high scale parameters, i.e., the axion decay constant which is determined to be sub-Planckian, a result consistent with string theory that disfavors trans-Planckian axion decay constant. Furthermore, the dark energy-dark matter interaction strength is constrained to be feeble, i.e., $\lambda\lesssim 4\times 10^{-6}$ m$_{\rm Pl}^{-2}$ Mpc$^{-2}$. We study possible implications of this type of potential on the Hubble tension and on the dynamics of the dark energy equation of state using the DESI-DR2 data. For the cases $N=3,4$, the analysis exhibits the phenomenon of transmutation even in the absence of coupling to dark matter, where thawing quintessence transmutes to freezing quintessence. The analysis is internally consistent in its treatment of the dark energy-dark matter interaction as it is based on an underlying Lagrangian, in contrast with several previous works where the sources are chosen in an ad hoc manner to satisfy energy conservation.

#### Forecasting Constraint on Primordial Black Hole Properties with the CSST $3\times2$pt Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 This study forecasts the constraints on the properties of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a cold dark matter component using the galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing (i.e. $3\times2$pt) measurements from the upcoming Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) photometric survey. Since PBHs formed via gravitational collapse in the early Universe, they can additionally affect the formation and evolution of the cosmic large-scale structure (LSS) through the ``Poisson" effect. We compute the angular power spectra for PBH-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and generate mock data based on the CSST instrumental and survey design. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed to constrain the free parameters, such as the product of the PBH fraction and mass $f_{\rm PBH}m_{\rm PBH}$ and other cosmological parameters. The systematic parameters are also included in the fitting process, such as the parameters of the baryonic effect, intrinsic alignment, galaxy bias, photometric redshift (photo-$z$) calibration, shear calibration, and noise terms. We find that the CSST 3$\times$2pt analysis can achieve tight constraints on $f_{\rm PBH}m_{\rm PBH}$, with 68% and 95% confidence levels (CLs) reaching $<10^{3.9} M_{\odot}$ and $<10^{4.7} M_{\odot}$, respectively. Additionally, the cosmological parameters, e.g. $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$ and $w$, can be constrained with the precisions of 3.3%, 1.7%, 13%, respectively. This indicates that the CSST 3$\times$2pt analysis is a powerful tool to advance the PBH dark matter studies in the near future.

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will enable astronomers to discover rare and distant astrophysical transients. Host-galaxy association is crucial for selecting the most scientifically interesting transients for follow-up. LSST Deep Drilling Field observations will detect distant transients occurring in galaxies below the detection limits of most all-sky catalogues. Here we investigate the use of pre-existing smaller-scale, field-specific catalogues for host identification in the Deep Drilling Fields (DDFs) and a ranking of their usefulness. We have compiled a database of 70 deep catalogues that overlap with the Rubin DDFs and constructed thin catalogues to be homogenised and combined for transient-host matching. A systematic ranking of their utility is discussed and applied based on the inclusion of information such as spectroscopic redshifts and morphological information. Utilising this data against a Dark Energy Survey (DES) sample of supernovae with pre-identified hosts in the XMM-LSS and ECDFS fields, we evaluate different methods for transient-host association in terms of both accuracy and processing speed. We also apply light data-cleaning techniques to identify and remove contaminants within our associations, such as diffraction spikes and blended galaxies where the correct host cannot be determined with confidence. We use a lightweight machine learning approach in the form of extreme gradient boosting to generate confidence scores in our contaminant selections and associated metrics. Finally, we discuss the computational expense of implementation within the LSST transient alert brokers, which will require efficient, fast-paced processing to handle the large stream of survey data.

#### Closing the gap: Follow-up observations of peculiar dusty objects close to Sgr A* using ERIS

 - **Abstract**
 Context. In addition to the supermassive black hole Sgr A*, the inner parsec of our Galactic center is home to numerous fruitful scientific habitats. One of these environments is the S cluster, which consists of two distinct populations: the main-sequence S stars and the dusty G objects. While the majority of the brightest S stars can be classified as young B stars, the G sources can be described as dusty objects whose nature is still under debate. Aims. In this work, we focus on the most prominent G objects in the S cluster and follow their Keplerian trajectory around Sgr A*. With this, we test the predictions based on almost two decades of monitoring of the direct vicinity of our central supermassive black hole using NACO and SINFONI, formerly mounted at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The goal is to increase the existing data baseline for G2/DSO, D9, and X7 to get insights into their evolution on their Keplerian trajectories. In addition, we revisit the massive Young Stellar Object (YSO) X3 and scrutinize the potential impact of its environment on this highly dynamic source. Methods. The successor to the two instruments is called ERIS and offers upgraded optics and improved properties, including an enhanced spectral resolution. We utilize the IFU mode of ERIS, called SPIFFIER. We search for the Doppler-shifted Br{\gamma} emission line to rediscover peculiar objects in the S cluster using SPIFFIER with the highest available spatial plate scale of 12.5 mas. Furthermore, we will derive the Br{\gamma} luminosity of G2/DSO to inspect the degree of its change more than ten years after the pericenter passage. If present, a decrease in the Br{\gamma} luminosity of G2/DSO on its descending part of the orbit would directly impact the direction of the debate about its nature.

 - **Abstract**
 $\delta$ Circini is known to be a massive multiple system containing a 3.9 d inner eclipsing binary in a slightly elliptical orbit exhibiting slow apsidal motion and a distant tertiary with a probable period of 1644 d. All three components of the system are O- or B-type stars. We carried out a comprehensive study of the system, based on light curves from TESS and other instruments, a new series of echelle spectra, older spectra from the ESO archive, and several VLTI interferometric observations. Due to the large amount of different types of data covering both orbits in the system, we obtained a more precise value of the long orbital period ($1603.24\pm0.19$ d) and fully determined all other orbital parameters. Although both orbits are eccentric, their period ratio is large enough for the system to be dynamically stable. The inner and outer orbits are in the same plane, which means that no Kozai-Lidov mechanism is acting in the system. Assuming solar metallicity in our MESA models, we found ages of $(4.4\pm 0.1)$, $(4.7\pm 0.2)$, and $(3.8\pm1.3)$ Myr for the primary, the secondary, and the tertiary, respectively. Our evolutionary scenario predicts that the inner eclipsing binary will merge within approximately 1.7 Myr and eventually evolve into a black hole. The distance to the system, estimated from the angular size of the outer orbit is $(809.9 \pm 1.8)$ pc, which implies that $\delta$ Cir might be located close to the centre of a stellar population ASCC 79, a subgroup of the young Circinus complex. With a total mass of $(53.04\pm0.29)$ M$_{\odot}$, $\delta$ Cir can contribute a significant fraction of the total mass of the population.

 We show that resonant processes during multi-field inflation can generate a large curvature perturbation on small scales. This perturbation naturally leads to the formation of primordial black holes that may constitute dark matter, as well as to the production of stochastic induced gravitational waves in the deci-Hz band. Such waves are within reach of future space-based interferometers such as LISA, DECIGO and BBO. In addition, primordial black hole binaries formed at late times produce merger gravitational waves that can be probed by the resonant cavity experiments in addition to DECIGO and BBO.

 - **Abstract**
 Warm Inflation is a scenario in which the inflaton field dissipates its energy during inflation to maintain a subdominant constant radiation bath. Two of its remarkable features are (i) inflation can be realized even by very steep potentials and (ii) such a scenario doesn't call for a separate post-inflation reheating phase. We exploit the first feature to show that Warm Inflation can successfully take place on the very steep left wing of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential while remaining in excellent agreement with current cosmological data (joint analysis of Planck, ACT and DESI). The Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential has a flatter right wing as well, which opens up the possibility of dark energy when the field rolls along this wing. However in order to successfully realize quintessential inflation one needs to (i) normalize the two wings of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential differently in order to bridge between the two extreme energy scales of inflation and dark energy, (ii) allow the quintessence field to be dissipative, which is consistent with the presence of a dissipative term in warm inflation. The dissipative dynamics of the quintessence field is needed in order to sustain slow-roll in the right wing. With these modifications, we demonstrate that the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential can give rise to a unified model of warm inflation (on the left wing) and transient dark energy (on the right wing).

 - **Abstract**
 We present a 9.3-sigma detection of the pairwise kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect by combining a sample of 913,286 Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1) catalog and co-added Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT DR6) and Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature maps. This represents the highest-significance pairwise kSZ measurement to date. The analysis uses three ACT CMB temperature maps: co-added 150 GHz, total frequency maps, and a component-separated Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map, all of which cover 19,000 square degrees of the sky from Advanced ACTPol observations conducted between 2017 and 2022. Comparison of the results of these three maps serves as a consistency check for potential foreground contamination that may depend on the observation frequency. An estimate of the best-fit mass-averaged optical depth is obtained by comparing the pairwise kSZ curve with the linear-theory prediction of the pairwise velocity under the best-fit Planck cosmology, and is compared with predictions from simulations. This estimate serves as a reference point for future comparisons with thermal SZ-derived optical depth measurements for the same DESI cluster samples, which will be presented in a companion paper. Finally, we employ a machine-learning approach trained on simulations to estimate the optical depth for 456,803 DESI LRG-identified clusters within the simulated mass range (greater than about 1e13 solar masses). These are combined with the measured kSZ signal to infer the individual cluster peculiar velocities, providing the opportunity to constrain the behavior of gravity and the dark sector over a range of cosmic scales and epochs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new measurement of the Hubble constant, independent of standard rulers and robust to pre-recombination modifications such as Early Dark Energy (EDE), obtained by calibrating the total energy density of the Universe. We start using the present-day photon density as an anchor, and use the baryon-to-photon ratio from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis based measurements and the baryon-to-matter ratio from the baryons' imprint on galaxy clustering to translate to a physical matter density at present day. We then compare this to measurements of the ratio of the matter density to the critical density ($\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$), calculated using the relative positions of the baryon acoustic oscillations, to measure the critical density of the universe and hence $H_0$. The important measurements of the evolution of the energy density all happen at low redshift, so we consider this a low-redshift measurement. We validate our method both on a suite of $N$-body mocks and on noiseless theory vectors generated across a wide range of Hubble parameters in both $\Lambda$CDM and EDE cosmologies. Using DESI DR1 data combined with the angular CMB acoustic scale and the latest BBN constraints, we find $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with existing early and late-time determinations of the Hubble constant. We consider the impact of non-standard dark energy evolution on our measurement. Future data, including that from further iterations of DESI and from Euclid, will add to these results providing a powerful test of the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy clustering constrains the baryon fraction Omega_b/Omega_m through the amplitude of baryon acoustic oscillations and the suppression of perturbations entering the horizon before recombination. This produces a different pre-recombination distribution of baryons and dark matter. After recombination, the gravitational potential responds to both components in proportion to their mass, allowing robust measurement of the baryon fraction. This is independent of new-physics scenarios altering the recombination background (e.g. Early Dark Energy). The accuracy of such measurements does, however, depend on how baryons and CDM are modeled in the power spectrum. Previous template-based splitting relied on approximate transfer functions that neglected part of information. We present a new method that embeds an extra parameter controlling the balance between baryons and dark matter in the growth terms of the perturbation equations in the CAMB Boltzmann solver. This approach captures the baryonic suppression of CDM prior to recombination, avoids inconsistencies, and yields a clean parametrization of the baryon fraction in the linear power spectrum, separating out the simple physics of growth due to the combined matter potential. We implement this framework in an analysis pipeline using Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure with HOD-informed priors and validate it against noiseless LCDM and EDE cosmologies with DESI-like errors. The new scheme achieves comparable precision to previous splitting while reducing systematic biases, providing a more robust way to baryon-fraction measurements. In combination with BBN constraints on the baryon density and Alcock-Paczynski estimates of the matter density, these results strengthen the use of baryon fraction measurements to derive a Hubble constant from energy densities, with future DESI and Euclid data expected to deliver competitive constraints.

#### Kinetic Mixing and the Phantom Illusion: Axion-Dilaton Quintessence in Light of DESI DR2

 - **Abstract**
 Recent results from DESI BAO analyses suggest that dark energy may not be a cosmological constant and is in fact dynamical. Furthermore, the data suggest that the equation of state may have been in the phantom regime in the distant past, recently undergoing a phantom crossing. In this work, we investigate whether this preference can be realized within a kinetically mixed axion-dilaton (KMIX) quintessence model, a string-motivated system in which an axion-like field couples exponentially to a dilaton-like (moduli) field. Crucially, KMIX can appear phantom in a standard Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) based analysis. To confront the model with data, we develop a fast pipeline based on normalizing flows that (i) learns a theory-informed prior on $(w_0,w_a)$ from KMIX realizations and (ii) provides an inverse mapping from CPL parameters back to the physical KMIX parameters. By importance-sampling pre-computed CPL chains using this framework, we effectively transform generic phenomenological constraints into direct, computationally efficient constraints on the underlying KMIX theory, avoiding the prohibitive cost of full parameter space exploration. Applied to Planck+DESI DR2 BAO measurements, our framework finds support for KMIX at $2.5\sigma$ compared to the base CPL fit at $3.1\sigma$, demonstrating that KMIX may account for the DESI preference without invoking true phantom behavior. When additionally including Type Ia supernovae data, we find that the preference remains above $3\sigma$ for Union3 and DES Y5, but drops to $2.1\sigma$ with Pantheon+. The latter, combined with the DESI full-shape power spectrum and bispectrum data, further reduces the preference to $1.7\sigma$. Ultimately, should the DESI deviation persist with future data, KMIX may offer a theoretically well-motivated explanation for the phantom-like signatures inferred from phenomenological fits.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a dynamical amplification mechanism for detecting symmetry breaking in black holes through environmentally driven spectral instabilities of quasinormal modes. Focusing on dynamical Chern-Simons gravity as a paradigm for parity violation, we perturb the Schwarzschild background with a localized potential bump. Our analysis reveals three distinctive phenomena absent in general relativity: 1) topological reconnections of mode branches, 2) counterintuitive mode stabilization that delays overtaking transitions, and 3) scalar mode dominance emerging at intermediate coupling strengths. These dynamical features amplify weak static splittings into observable signatures, establishing a connection between gravitational symmetry breaking and non-Hermitian spectral physics. Our framework provides new pathways for testing modified gravity theories through gravitational wave observations.

 We develop a fully numerical framework to compute and visualize the \emph{hypershadow}\cite{Novo:2024wyn}, the three-dimensional generalization of the black hole shadow in five-dimensional spacetimes. Our method is based on backward ray tracing and allows flexible control over observer position, enabling the reconstruction of the full shadow volume. For visualization, we combine discrete sampling with surface contouring and introduce reflection difference maps on central slices to quantify mirror symmetries. Applying this method to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini and Myers-Perry geometries, we validate the former's spherical symmetry and systematically discuss the hypershadow's dependence on observer position and black hole spin parameters. We also provide compact quantitative measures for size reduction and global displacement, revealing clear monotonic this http URL framework is readily extendible to other metrics and opens the way to numerical studies of more exotic objects, such as black rings and their prospective toroidal hypershadows.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the symmetries and conserved quantities in $f(R)$ gravity for the static, spherically symmetric Reissner--Nordström spacetime using two complementary frameworks: Noether symmetries and Mei symmetries. Starting from a canonical Lagrangian for radial metric functions and the curvature scalar $R$, we derive the associated Hamiltonian and show that the Legendre map is regular whenever both the first derivative of $f(R)$ with respect to $R$ and the second derivative with respect to $R$ is non-zero. Within Noether's approach (variational and Lie-derivative forms), we obtain general, canonical, and internal symmetry classes and identify explicit generators; for the quadratic model $f(R)=R^{2}$ these include radial translations and scaling symmetries. We then formulate Mei symmetry conditions as invariance of the Euler--Lagrange equations under the first prolongation, which yields an overdetermined partial differential equation (PDE) system for the generator components. Solving this system for $f(R)=R^{2}$, we find eight independent Mei generators and construct the corresponding conserved currents, some without a direct Noether analog. The analysis demonstrates that Mei symmetries extend the standard Noether framework for higher-order Lagrangians and provide additional conserved quantities relevant to black-hole dynamics in modified gravity. We conclude with a comparison of the two symmetry schemes and outline applications to broader $f(R)$ models and to rotating spacetimes.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole binaries with small mass ratios will be important sources for the forthcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. Models of such binaries also serve as useful tools for understanding the dynamics of compact binary systems and the gravitational waves they emit. Using an eccentric Ori-Thorne procedure developed in previous work, we build worldlines that describe the full inspiral and plunge of a small body on an initially eccentric orbit of a Kerr black hole. We now calculate the gravitational waves associated with these trajectories using a code that solves the Teukolsky equation in the time domain. The final cycles of these waveforms, the ringdown, contains a superposition of Kerr quasinormal modes followed by a power-law tail. In this paper, we study how a binary's eccentricity and orbital anomaly angle affect the excitation of both quasinormal modes and late-time tails. We find that the relative excitation of quasinormal modes varies in an important and interesting way with these parameters. For some anomaly angles, the relative excitations of quasinormal modes are essentially indistinguishable from those excited in quasi-circular coalescences. Consistent with other recent studies, we find that eccentricity tends to amplify the late-time power-law tail, though the amount of this amplification varies significantly with orbital anomaly. We thus find that eccentricity has an important impact on the late-time coalescence waveform, but the interplay of eccentricity and orbit anomaly complicates this impact.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of late-time tails in gravitational radiation from merging spin-aligned eccentric binary black holes, using high-accuracy point-particle black hole perturbation theory simulations. We simulate the late-time evolution of 15 binary black hole mergers with mass ratio $q = 1000$, dimensionless spins $\chi = [-0.9, -0.6, 0.0, 0.6, 0.9]$ and eccentricity at the last stable orbit $e_{\rm LSO} = [0.8, 0.9, 0.95]$. We track the tail amplitudes and exponents up to a retarded time coordinate $t = 9000M$ after merger for the six spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes $(2,1)$, $(2,2)$, $(3,2)$, $(3,3)$, $(4,3)$, and $(4,4)$ employing both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. We note that the tails are increasingly pronounced for binaries with high eccentricity $e_{\rm LSO}$ and large negative spin $\chi$. We find that the overall late-time exponents closely approach their predicted asymptotic values ($p=-\ell-4$ for Weyl curvature scalar $\psi_{4,\ell m}$ where $\ell$ is the spin-weighted spherical harmonic index), while estimates restricted to the latest portion of the data exactly recover them. We further verify numerically that modes with the same spherical index $\ell$ share identical tail exponents, while variations in $m$ do not affect the tail behavior. Our analysis framework is publicly available through the gwtails Python package.

 - **Abstract**
 The multi-messenger detection of the binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817 has revolutionized the field of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy. However, several important questions remain to be answered. One of these is the nature of the compact remnant leftover by GW170817 (short- or long-lived NS versus black hole). A key goal going forward is to understand the diversity of NS-NS merger remnants, and how such diversity maps onto their viability as gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engines. Here, we present a study aimed at assessing the sensitivity of triggered searches for intermediate-duration, post-merger GWs powered by long-lived GRB remnants using networks of current and future ground-based GW detectors and the Cross-Correlation Algorithm (CoCoA). We develop a Python-based framework to efficiently estimate CoCoA distance horizons for a broad range of post merger secular bar-mode waveforms and for different GW detector networks. This framework can be used to identify the most promising regions of parameter space in which to concentrate search efforts, helping design future search strategies to optimally balance search sensitivity and related parameter space gridding schema against computational cost.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate black hole solutions in the mimetic extension of the Einstein-Yang-Mills system, in which the Yang-Mills term is constrained to be constant. In the Abelian U(1) case, we find a static spherically symmetric solution that includes the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom black holes as special cases. Moreover, we identify a stealth Schwarzschild solution with an electric hair. We show that it is impossible to have magnetic hair in the U(1) gauge case, while, in contrast, the non-Abelian SU(2) stealth solutions can sustain both electric and magnetic hair. Unlike the conventional SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills black hole, which requires a unit magnetic parameter to exhibit nontrivial non-Abelian contributions, the stealth mimetic SU(2) solution admits genuinely non-Abelian configurations with arbitrary integer magnetic parameter.

 - **Abstract**
 Based on the Comisso-Asenjo mechanism, we investigate the kinematic images of plasma before and after magnetic reconnection in Kerr-Anti-de Sitter(Kerr-AdS) black holes. Following a brief review of the Comisso-Asenjo process in Kerr-AdS black holes, we introduce the hotspot model and the imaging method. Building upon these foundational theories, we obtain the trajectory of the plasma and the temporal evolution of the hotspot images. It is found that there are three flares within the observing time, which is driven by the Comisso-Asenjo mechanism. We also discuss the influence of the cosmological parameter on the hotspot imaging. The results indicate that the hotspot image enlarges as the absolute value of $\Lambda$ increases, demonstrating that the cosmological constant significantly affects the hotspot.

 We show that General Relativity and other geometrical theories can be viewed as a degenerate Otto cycle with only heat-exchange legs in emergent gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how the newly obtained static black hole in bumblebee gravity affects the behavior of accreting matter and its observable signatures. The Lorentz-violating parameter that characterizes this geometry modifies photon trajectories and shifts the location of the critical curve that defines the shadow. Using ray tracing, we examine light deflection, the structure of direct emission, lensing rings, and photon rings, and we explore three thin-disk emission models--starting at the ISCO, at the photon sphere, and at the event horizon--together with static and infalling spherical accretions. Larger values of this parameter enlarge the shadow, move all optical features outward, and suppress the observed intensity through gravitational redshift, with additional dimming produced by Doppler effects for infalling matter

 - **Abstract**
 We study the retrograde second caustics of extremal Kerr black holes, where the intensity of the light beam is infinitely magnified. We find that the caustics of different polarized beams are split by as much as $10^{-3}$rad by an external black hole for a suitable range of parameters. A lensing black hole at several lys away separates the polarized beams about $10^{12}$m apart. This splitting is larger than the radius of the Earth. Therefore, an observer on Earth would see different circularly polarized light according to their location. The polarization will change while the detector is wandering around. Thus, the polarization of light beams can be an important quantity in retrolensing observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the charging process of a rotating Kerr black hole of mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$ immersed in a stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically uniform magnetic field of strength $B_{0}$. In Wald's classic analysis (Wald 1974), which was based on the assumption of vanishing injection energy, the black hole was predicted to acquire a universal "saturation charge" $Q_{\mathrm{w}}=2B_{0}J$. However, the physical mechanism that sets the saturation charge must ultimately be governed by the competition between the absorption rates of positively and negatively charged particles. Motivated by this observation, we revisit the problem in the framework of a simple accretion model, where two dilute, equivalent fluxes of charged particles of opposite signs are injected from infinity along the magnetic field lines. The problem then reduces to that of individual particle motion in the electromagnetic field of the magnetized Kerr black hole. Using a combination of numerical and analytical tools, we determine the domains of absorption and establish both lower and upper bounds on the corresponding absorption cross sections. At $Q=Q_\mathrm{w}$ these bounds reveal a systematic difference between the two charge signs. In particular, for sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the lower bound on the absorption cross section for the "attracted" charge exceeds the upper bound for the "repelled" one. This charge accretion imbalance (which we find to become extreme at the limit of large $B_{0}$) indicates a persistent net charge accretion at $Q=Q_{\mathrm{w}}$, implying that the actual saturation charge must differ from Wald's charge $Q_{\mathrm{w}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate gravitational perturbations, quasinormal modes, grey-body factors, and absorption cross-sections of the recently proposed regular and asymptotically flat black hole supported by a Dehnen-type dark-matter halo. This geometry provides a remarkably simple analytic model of supermassive black holes embedded in galactic environments, having a lapse function $ f(r)=1-2 M r^{2}/(r+a)^{3}, $ [R. A. Konoplya, A. Zhidenko, 2511.03066]. The regularizing parameter $a$ is the characteristic scale of the halo. We compute the quasinormal spectrum for both axial "up" and "down" perturbations using the WKB method and verify the results through time-domain integration. The two sectors are no longer isospectral, and the deviations grow with the halo scale parameter. The grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections are extracted via standard scattering boundary conditions and the WKB approach, and their behaviour is fully consistent with the structure of the effective potentials. Altogether, our analysis demonstrates that a dark-matter halo imprint induces modifications in the gravitational response, while the employed approximation schemes remain sufficiently accurate for quantitative predictions. At asymptotically late times, the presence of the halo does not alter the Price-law decay, which remains identical to that of a Schwarzschild black hole in vacuum.

Given the usefulness of moments in the categorisation of radiation patterns, tidal deformations, and other phenomena associated with compact objects, a number of studies have explored their construction in beyond-Einstein theories of gravity. It is shown here that uniqueness does not necessarily extend across theories: by comparing a few static and spherically-symmetric solutions in different theories, we find that two distinct objects can possess the same Geroch-Hansen moments. Moreover, two metrics can match and yet take different moments. Implications of this result are explored in the context of black-hole shadows and ``universal'' relations hinging on moment computations.

 - **Abstract**
 In gravitational theories containing matter fields and higher-derivative corrections, the standard Smarr formula often fails unless all dimensionful couplings are incorporated consistently. Traditionally, parameters such as the cosmological constant or the coefficients of higher-derivative terms are regarded as immutable features of the theory and therefore excluded from the thermodynamic phase space. In our recent work, we developed a fully general framework that promotes every such coupling to a dynamical, freely varying parameter of black hole solutions. This is accomplished by introducing, for each coupling, an auxiliary scalar and gauge field, through which the coupling appears as a conserved charge associated with the global sector of an emergent gauge symmetry. The corresponding conjugate variables naturally arise as electric potentials evaluated at the black hole horizon. As a result, the first law and the Smarr relation acquire additional, systematically determined contributions, yielding a consistent and universal extension of black hole thermodynamics. We illustrate the validity of this construction by revisiting several black hole examples in the literature where the Smarr formula remains inconsistent even after treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic variable. Our analysis shows that only by including all dimensionful couplings in this generalized manner can one obtain an internally consistent Smarr relation, thereby providing the foundation for a truly universal formulation of black hole thermodynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a charged particle orbiting a four-dimensional Schwarzschild--de Sitter black hole using a semiclassical approach. We calculate the probability amplitude for the charged particle to emit a photon, from which we derive the emitted power and spectral distributions. The results are compared with those obtained for scalar fields, considering both minimal and nonminimal coupling, as well as the corresponding electromagnetic case in the Schwarzschild spacetime. It is found that the total electromagnetic power is approximately twice that of the scalar field with conformal coupling for orbits with low angular velocity, similar to the Schwarzschild case, whereas for minimal coupling, the scalar power can even exceed the electromagnetic power. We also investigate the spectral distributions and possible synchrotron emission by orbits near the photon sphere. The electromagnetic case has a much broader frequency spectrum, with a non-negligible lower multipole contribution.

 - **Abstract**
 Current state-of-the-art approaches to black hole (BH) dynamics, encompassing several effective approximation schemes, offer a remarkable control of the quantitative aspects of strong gravity. They also provide key insights into some qualitative aspects of the problem. In spite of this, there remain blind spots that hinder the understanding of the mechanisms underlying some observed phenomena, in particular concerning simplicity and universality in BH spacetimes. Adopting an 'asymptotic reasoning' approach, by filtering non-essential degrees of freedom, can potentially unveil universality patterns by identifying key underlying structural stability mechanisms. We first illustrate such an asymptotic approach by focusing on a BH quasinormal (QNM) Weyl's law, that accounts for the universal asymptotics of the QNM "counting function". This permits to identify light-trapping and the (local) redshift effect as the underlying mechanisms, also offering a bridge to the universal patterns found in BH QNM spectral instability. As a by-product, Weyl's law universality formally opens an observational access to spacetime (effective) dimensionality. More heuristically, we sketch a program recently put forward to apply such 'asymptotic reasoning' to address the observed simplicity and universality patterns in binary BH merger dynamics. This program is built as a hierarchy of asymptotic models, potentially making contact with integrability theory in gravity, namely through the background sector in a "wave-mean flow" approach to BH binary dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Infinite towers of higher-order corrections to General Relativity have been proposed as a mechanism to resolve singularities in early-universe cosmology and black holes, in a variety of settings. In this work, we consider an infinite tower of higher-order Proca corrections inspired by dimensional regularizations of Lovelock invariants. We find that the Big Bang singularity present in General Relativity is replaced by an inflationary epoch. Furthermore, the Lovelock-Proca tower allows for regular planar black hole solutions and spherically symmetric black holes with primary hair.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate prediction of particle creation from accelerating mirrors is crucial for interpreting forthcoming analog Hawking radiation experiments such as AnaBHEL. However, realistic experimental setups render the associated Bogoliubov integrals analytically intractable. To address this challenge, we introduce the Inertial Replacement Method (IRM), a hybrid analytic-numerical framework for computing Bogoliubov coefficients for general moving-mirror trajectories. The IRM replaces the asymptotically inertial portions of a trajectory with analytic inertial extensions, so that numerical evaluation is required only for the finite accelerating segment. We derive perturbative error bounds for both perfectly and imperfectly reflecting mirrors, providing controlled accuracy estimates and guiding the choice of segmentation thresholds. The method is validated against analytically solvable trajectories and then applied to a fully numerical, PIC-based Chen-Mourou plasma-mirror trajectory relevant to the planned AnaBHEL experiment. A key physical insight emerging from this analysis is that the radiation spectrum is determined almost entirely by the finite accelerating region, with negligible sensitivity to the far-past and far-future inertial motion. These results establish the IRM as a reliable and broadly applicable computational tool for modeling particle creation in realistic analog-gravity systems such as AnaBHEL.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) can encode valuable information about the properties of the intervening lens, yet most existing studies remain restricted to the small-deflection, weak-field regime. To bridge this crucial gap, this work presents the first systematic analysis of strong-field, wave-optical GW lensing by a Kerr black hole (BH), extending recent results for non-rotating lenses obtained in Chan et al. to the astrophysically more relevant case of spinning lens. Using the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalism, we compute the strong-field scattering factor (SFSF) and show that the the spin produces characteristic modifications to the lensed waveform, and high-frequency incident radiation is not strongly absorbed by the BH lens, contrary to earlier claims in Chan et al. We further derive an explicit expression for the observed waveform for the general source-lens-observer configuration, showcasing the distortions produced by the scattering and quantifying their departure from the Schwarzschild case. Specializing to on-axis scattering, a mismatch analysis for a \texttt{GW150914}-like source lensed by a Kerr BH of mass $M=10^2M_\odot$ situated $100GM/c^2$ away from the source reveals percentage-level deviations from the direct (unscattered) wave at scattering angles near $30^\circ$, across a range of lens spin values. The mismatch exhibits a sharp decrease at larger scattering angles. For a fixed scattering angle, however, the mismatch shows only a weak dependence on the BH spin in the case of on-axis scattering, which may improve for more general off-axis considerations. The framework developed here offers a unified treatment of strong-field GW scattering in Kerr spacetime and provides tools for interpreting future high-precision observations of compact-object lenses in the wave-optics regime.

#### Probing Observable Features of Lorentz violation in Low-Energy Hořava Gravity with Accretion Disk Images of Black Hole

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study the observable signatures of Lorentz violation (LV) in low-energy Horava gravity by simulating the images and polarization features of rotating LV black holes using a backward ray-tracing method. Within a thin-disk accretion model and the ZAMO framework, we numerically solve the geodesics equation of photon and simulate the corresponding thin-disk images and polarization patterns. The results show that the LV parameter l strongly affects the inner shadow, brightness asymmetry, and polarization properties of the thin disk. The decrease of l leads to a more elliptical and untilted inner shadow, while increasing l produces a pronounced leftward D-shaped structure of the critical curve. In addition, the variation of l alters the distribution of polarized intensity and polarization direction, especially near the critical curve. Moreover, it also shows that a positive l enhances the black hole's angular velocity, while a negative one suppresses it, indicating that the sign of l determines the trend direction of the LV effect. These findings suggest that future high-resolution EHT observations combining the thin-disk images and polarization patterns could provide valuable tests of the LV effect.

 - **Abstract**
 Regular black holes, free of central singularities, provide an ideal laboratory for probing the geometric structure of spacetime. The global structure of some regular black holes, e.g. Hayward black hole, features an event horizon and a Cauchy horizon, raising fundamental questions about the latter's stability. In this work, we investigate collapse of a scalar field in Hayward spacetime. Under weak scalar perturbations, the inner horizon maintains a stable finite radius. In the circumstance of a strong scalar field, the inner horizon shrinks to zero volume, accompanied by the formation of a spacelike singularity. The Hayward geometry is effectively converted into a Schwarzschild-like geometry. Furthermore, the strength of the scalar field governs the contraction dynamics of the inner horizon. As the parameter $p$ of the initial profile for the scalar field approaches the critical threshold ${p_*}$, the radius of the inner horizon ${r_{-}}$ exhibits a universal scaling behavior: ${r_{-}}\propto{|p - {p_*}|^\gamma}$, with a critical exponent $\gamma\approx 0.5$.

 - **Abstract**
 We prove the global leading-order late-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions to inhomogeneous wave equations on dynamical black hole exterior backgrounds that settle down to Schwarzschild backgrounds with arbitrarily small decay rates. In particular, we show that for non-spherically symmetric solutions arising from compactly supported initial data, the late-time decay deviates from Price's law -- governing the decay for stationary black hole backgrounds -- by exhibiting slower time decay by exactly one additional power. Our proof is based around the observation that the emergence of late-time "tails", featuring inverse-polynomial decay in time, is intimately connected to conformal irregularity properties in space (towards future null infinity) of time integrals of the solutions. This relationship is exploited through a purely physical-space approach based around energy estimates, in which the dynamical wave operator is treated as a Schwarzschild wave operator with an inhomogeneous term. Going from almost-sharp decay to global asymptotics is achieved by exploiting this relation for the difference between the solution and a carefully chosen global tail function. We further apply our method to several examples of nonlinear wave equations and comment on its robustness to more general settings, such as dynamical spacetimes converging to sub-extremal Kerr spacetimes and higher-dimensional wave operators with even or odd spacetime dimensions.

 - **Abstract**
 We use diffeomorphic mappings to connect black hole metrics with complex solutions allowed by the Kontsevich-Segal criterion. By swapping radial and time-like coordinates and applying complex mappings, we derive dynamic metrics suitable for a Quantum Field Theory. This is shown for static and rotating black holes, mapping their interiors into the Kantowski-Sachs and a specific Gowdy-type cosmological model. We offer interpretations of the period during which the Kontsevich-Segal criterion holds.

#### Expanding the Weak Gravity Conjecture in AdS Space

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the extension of our recent proposal for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) in AdS space to more general effective field theories. We first extend the conjecture to set-ups where moduli are present and we demand that a particle, produced during the decay of an extremal black hole via the Schwinger effect, is repelled close to the horizon of the black hole. We interpret this condition as the universal criterion imposed by the WGC for any background. Interestingly, the constraint imposed by the WGC on the particle spectrum, before the stabilization of the moduli, is independent of the background, resulting in the same bound both in Minkowski and in AdS space. For the case of AdS space, after the stabilization of the moduli, the WGC in AdS space is reproduced due to the formation of a non-singular horizon of the extremal black hole. In that case, the particle spectrum must satisfy the stronger of the two WGC conditions obtained before and after moduli stabilization. Finally, we use these results to argue that a similar version of the tower WGC should also apply to an AdS background.

#### Unraveling the effect of rotation on the confinement/deconfinement transition of the quark-gluon plasma

 - **Abstract**
 There is an apparent contradiction in the current literature about the effect of rotation in the quark gluon plasma (QGP). While results from lattice QCD predict an increase in the confinement/deconfinement critical temperature, approximated calculations and effective models, including holographic ones, lead to the opposite result. Non central heavy ion collisions form QGPs with relativistic rotational velocities. Thereby, a great interest was drawn into the effect of rotation in strongly interacting matter. In this work, we show that the apparent contradiction is associated with the choices of observer considered in each case. We consider a holographic description of a rotating plasma using a Myers-Perry black hole. For a static observer, the result is that the confinement/deconfinement temperature decreases with the angular velocity, while for an observer co-rotating with the plasma the opposite behavior is found, in agreement with lattice calculations.
