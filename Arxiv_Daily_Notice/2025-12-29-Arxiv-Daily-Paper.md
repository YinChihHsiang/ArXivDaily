 - **Abstract**
 The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), adopted by ESA and scheduled for the second half of the next decade, will drive a new revolution in the rapidly growing field of gravitational-wave astronomy, by extending GW observations into the hiterto unexplored millihertz regime. One of the key source classes of LISA is merging massive black hole binaries in the 1e4-1e7 Msun mass range detectable to very high redshifts $z\sim 15$. MBHBs lighter than 1e6 Msun can potentially be identified during their inspiral weeks before coalescence, allowing for complementary electromagnetic observations before, during, and after the two MBHs merge. This white paper aims at defining the optimal strategy to maximize the number of detected EM counterparts of LISA MBHB events.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the sensitivity of upcoming and idealized weak lensing surveys to gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the nanohertz to microhertz frequency band. This range, situated between the reach of pulsar timing arrays and space-based interferometers, remains observationally underexplored. Building upon the formalism for GW-induced shear distortions, we develop a signal-to-noise framework that incorporates realistic survey characteristics, including cadence, angular resolution, and depth. We model the effective galaxy population using a redshift- and luminosity-dependent distribution to evaluate the noise power spectral density across the survey. Applying this framework to both LSST-like and idealized survey configurations, we derive characteristic strain sensitivity curves and identify the detectable parameter space for SMBHBs. We find that while current surveys are limited by angular resolution, an ideal full-sky survey with milliarcsecond-level precision and rapid cadence could detect continuous GW signals from SMBHBs at cosmological distances and partially bridge the PTA-LISA sensitivity gap. Our analysis highlights the potential and limitations of weak-lensing surveys for low-frequency GW astronomy, with angular resolution emerging as the dominant constraint.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) have recently been proposed as potential probes for Population III stars. However, the properties of the accretion flow and the wind from the Pop III star TDE system are not clear. By performing radiative hydrodynamic simulations, we study the 'circularized' accretion flow of the Pop III star TDE system. The masses of the black hole (BH) and the disrupted star are $10^6$ and $300$ solar masses, respectively. We focus on the properties of the wind. We find that the black hole accretion rate is highly super-Eddington. A strong wind is driven by radiation pressure. Due to the presence of a strong wind, only $25\%$--$35\%$ of the fallback debris is accreted by the BH. The remaining part is taken away by the wind. The kinetic power of the wind can be as high as $10^{46} {\rm \ erg \ s^{-1}}$. The properties of the wind obtained in this paper may be useful for understanding the radiation properties of Pop III star TDEs in the context of the wind 'reprocessing' model.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of M31 UCXB-1, the first extragalactic ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB) with an orbital period of $T_{\rm orb} \sim 465$ s, presents a unique laboratory for studying close binary evolution and an unprecedented target for continuous gravitational wave (GW) searches. Its identification as a strong candidate black hole-white dwarf (BH-WD) system, combined with its exceptionally short period and high X-ray luminosity, suggests it may be one of the most vital low-frequency GW sources in M31. In this \textit{Letter}, we investigate the detectability of its GW signal for future space-borne detectors in multiband GW detection. We find that while its signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for low-frequency detectors remains marginal for high-confidence detection, middle-frequency detectors such as DECIGO and BBO are far more promising, potentially achieving S/N $\varrho>8$ within reasonable observational duration. With a primary mass of only $m_1 > 5.4M_\odot$ (or $6.6M_\odot$), the network of all low and middle frequency detector (or BBO alone) is capable of detecting GW from this system with a $\varrho > 8$, during 10-year observation. Furthermore, orbital eccentricity can enhance the GW strain at higher harmonics, further improving its detectability, especially for middle-frequency detectors. This study establishes M31 UCXB-1 as a key prototype of short-period UCXBs, cementing its role as a cornerstone for multiband, multi-messenger astrophysics and a vital bridge between X-ray astronomy and the future GW era.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences are standard sirens that provide a direct measure of the source's luminosity distance, enabling an independent measurement of the Hubble constant (H0). While a bright siren -- a GW event with an identified electromagnetic (EM) counterpart -- provided the first such constraint, most detections, currently dominated by black hole mergers, lack EM signatures. A measurement of H0 is still possible with these dark sirens by statistically associating GW events with galaxies in existing catalogs based on the sky localization. In this work, we explore the potential of two subsets of sirens: rare golden dark sirens, for which a single galaxy dominates the H0 posterior, and silver dark sirens, which are far more common but have a larger set of plausible host galaxies. Using the fifth internal data release of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), we assess the suitability of the Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) for spectroscopic follow-up of dark sirens. VIRUS exposures of the standard HETDEX depth provide precise redshifts and exquisite completeness within z = 0.2. After a single year of observations with the upgraded LIGO-A# network, the combined sample of golden and silver dark sirens with z < 0.2 and follow-up VIRUS observations can potentially yield a few-percent constraint on H0. Our predictions suggest that spectroscopic redshift surveys such as HETDEX can play a key role in realizing high-precision cosmology with dark sirens in the near future. Standard-siren distance measurements offer a critical, fully independent path to the local value of H0 to resolve the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 ATLAS (Asteroid Terrestrial Last Alert System) is a time-domain survey using four telescopes, covering the entire sky. It has observed over 10,000 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), with thousands of cosmology-grade light curves (to be released as TITAN DR1). To prepare this massive, low-redshift dataset for cosmology, we evaluate and cross-calibrate ATLAS forced photometry using tertiary stars from the DES (Dark Energy Survey) Y6 release. The 5000 deg$^2$ DES footprint overlaps regions both in and out of the PS1 (Pan-STARRS DR1) footprint, allowing tests of the primary calibrator for the ATLAS Refcat2 catalog. Initial offsets are at the $\sim$40 mmag scale. To improve this we determine $\Delta$ zeropoint offsets for two cases: (1) pixel-to-pixel offsets within individual CCDs (reduced from $\sim$8 to $\sim$4 mmag RMS) and (2) chip-to-chip offsets across the 9 CCDs and filters (reduced from $\sim$17 to $\sim$3 mmag RMS). We also identify the largest systematic uncertainty as a transmission-function color dependence, requiring shifts in the assumed ATLAS filters at the $\sim$30 mmag level if uncorrected. We validate our calibration using (a) CALSPEC standards, (b) an independent tertiary catalog, and (c) distance moduli of cross-matched SNe~Ia, all showing improved consistency. Overall, we estimate combined calibration-related systematics at the $\sim$5--10 mmag level, supporting competitive cosmological constraints with the TITAN SN~Ia dataset.

 - **Abstract**
 (Shortened)Context: We analyze the optical variability of the FSRQ Ton 599 using BVRI photometry from the WEBT collaboration (2011-2023), complemented by photometric and spectroscopic data from the Steward Observatory.\\ Aims: To characterize short- and long-term optical variability -- including flux distributions, intranight changes, color evolution, and spectra -- to constrain physical parameters and processes in the central engine.\\ Methods: We tested flux distributions in each filter against normal and log-normal, explored the RMS-flux relation and derived PSDs. We quantified intranight variability using a $\chi^2$ test and fractional variability. From variability timescales, we estimated the emitting region size and magnetic field. Long-term variability was studied by segmenting the light curve into 12 intervals and analyzing flux statistics. For multi-filter flares, we computed spectral slopes, redshift-corrected fluxes, monochromatic luminosities and generated Color-magnitude and color-time diagrams. From low-flux spectra, we measured Mg II line and estimated the black hole mass.\\ Results: Ton 599 showed strong optical variability. Log-normal distributions fit the fluxes better, and all bands show a positive RMS-flux relation with red-noise this http URL variability is detected, and used in constraining the emission region and magnetic this http URL R band reaches a peak flux of 23.5 mJy, corresponding to a monochromatic luminosity of $log({\nu}L{\nu})= 48.48 [erg/s]$. We found a redder-when-brighter trend at low fluxes (thermal), achromatic behavior at intermediate levels (possibly due to jet orientation changes), and a bluer-when-brighter trend at high fluxes (synchrotron). Long-term color changes are modest, short-term are significant, with a negative correlation between the amplitude of color changes and the average flux. The estimated SMBH mass is order of $10^8 M_\odot$.

 - **Abstract**
 Orbital eccentricity remains one of the least accessible parameters in observations of binary black hole (BBH) systems, largely erased by gravitational radiation long before detection. We introduce a new method to recover this lost parameter by using a more accessible and routinely measurable quantity: spin-orbit misalignment. In isolated binary evolution, a natal kick from the second supernova both tilts the orbital plane and injects orbital eccentricity, forging a direct and quantifiable connection between spin-tilt and post-supernova eccentricity. By measuring this spin-tilt using gravitational waves, we can not only constrain the natal kick, but we can also reconstruct the binary's formation eccentricity. We apply this method to GW190412 and GW241011, assuming an isolated formation channel, and show how their eccentricity at formation can be constrained even in the absence of direct eccentricity measurements. As more advanced detectors come online, improved signal-to-noise ratios will tighten spin-tilt constraints, allowing more precise and reliable estimates of BBH formation eccentricity. Combining this method with multiband observations from LISA and next-generation (XG) detectors will allow us to recover not only eccentricity but also the binary's orbital separation and redshift at formation, offering a clearer picture of the birth environments of BBH systems and processes that drive their merger.

 - **Abstract**
 The excursion-set formalism enables us to infer the mass distribution of collapsed objects, such as primordial black holes (PBHs), by the language of stochastic processes. Within the framework, this article investigates how a smooth coarse-graining procedure affects the resulting PBH mass function. As a demonstrative example, we employ a Gaussian window function, for which the stochastic noise becomes fully correlated across scales. It is found that these correlated noises result in a mass function of PBHs, whose maximum and its neighbourhood are predominantly determined by the probability that the density contrast exceeds a given threshold at each mass scale. Our results clarify the role of noise correlations induced by smooth coarse-graining and highlight their importance in predicting the abundance of PBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the work of Scully \textit{et al.} [ \textcolor{blue}{Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 115, 8131 (2018)}] and Camblong \textit{et al.}[ \textcolor{blue}{Phys. Rev. D 102, 085010 (2020)}], we investigate horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) for freely falling two-level atoms in the geometry of a Bardeen regular black hole. Building on the quantum-optics approach to acceleration radiation and its near-horizon conformal quantum mechanics (CQM) structure, we show that the dominant physics is again governed by an inverse-square potential in the radial Klein-Gordon equation, with an effective coupling fixed by the Bardeen surface gravity. Using geodesic expansions and a near-horizon CQM reduction of the scalar field, we derive the excitation probability for atoms falling through a Boulware-like vacuum in the presence of a stretched-horizon mirror. The resulting spectrum is Planckian in the mode frequency, with a temperature determined by the Bardeen Hawking temperature. We analyze how the regular core parameter controls the strength of the radiation and demonstrate that the excitation probability is strongly suppressed as the geometry approaches the extremal (cold remnant) limit. Numerical results illustrate the dependence of the spectrum on the Bardeen parameter and on the atomic transition frequency.

 - **Abstract**
 Fundamental physics today is best defined operationally: it is the program of identifying the microscopic degrees of freedom, symmetries, and dynamical laws that (i) reproduce the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, General Relativity (GR), and the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model in their regimes of validity, and (ii) explain the observed phenomena that these baseline theories do not account for (dark matter, neutrino masses, baryogenesis, dark energy), while resolving conceptual inconsistencies (quantum gravity, naturalness, the cosmological constant problem, the measurement problem in quantum theory, information in black holes) and providing predictive unification. This review first lays out the SM+GR+$\Lambda$CDM baseline, the best current evidence for its parameters, and the concrete anomalies and missing ingredients. It then surveys the most relevant theoretical directions (effective field theories; amplitude/positivity programs; lattice and many-body methods; symmetry-based model building; cosmological EFTs; quantum information approaches to QFT/gravitation) and the experimental/observational landscape, including ground and space platforms, astronomical messengers, and in-situ tests. Throughout we emphasize: (a) how each observable maps to energy scales and couplings; (b) the dominant statistical and systematic limitations; (c) the sensitivity required for decisive progress. A staged roadmap is given only after the technical review, organized by decision points and cross-checks rather than by specific projects.

 - **Abstract**
 This short report is dedicated to the 40th anniversary of International Journal of Modern Physics A (IJMPA) and Modern Physics Letters A (MPLA). While the report is based on a series of papers[1-8], its content reflects my personal viewpoints. Therefore I am solely responsible for all the statements in the report. In this report we discuss conservation of energies in a curved spacetime including general relativity. We argue that the matter energy is not necessarily conserved in a curved space time due to a lack of time translational invariance, and adding energy of gravitational fields to recover the conservation law of energies fails due to Noether's 2nd theorem. We show that there exists conserved quantities associated with the matter

#### Analytical Forms and Degeneracy of Quasinormal Modes for Kerr-Newman-de Sitter Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the quasinormal modes of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes for massless spin particles using the unified equation. We derive analytical expressions for both the quasinormal mode frequencies and the radial wave functions. The frequencies are determined exclusively by the black hole parameters and the quantum numbers $n$ and $m$, while the radial wave functions also depend on the quantum number $k$, indicating a degeneracy in frequency. For identical quantum numbers, the frequency expression and the degree of degeneracy are the same for all massless spin particles, regardless of their specific properties. This implies that, through the observation of quasinormal modes, one can not only determine the black hole's parameters but also observe the phenomenon in which one type of particle reproduces the quasinormal mode of another. Our work thus provides a theoretical foundation for understanding this mimicking behavior as well.

#### Scattering of massless waves with arbitrary spin: a unified analysis for Schwarzschild-type medium black holes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21568

 - **Abstract**
 A unified equation is employed to analytically investigate the scattering of massless spin particles by a Schwarzschild-type medium black hole. It is found that for spin particles, curved spacetime induces an effective complex potential analogous to a Coulomb field. While the real part of this potential contributes a real logarithmic term to the phase, the imaginary part gives rise to a corresponding imaginary logarithmic term. Crucially, this imaginary term is precisely responsible for generating the correct asymptotic decay of the wave function. From this framework, a unified analytical expression for the differential cross section is derived, applicable to all particle types considered. Given the successful fabrication of a Schwarzschild-equivalent medium via transformation optics, our theoretical scattering predictions can be tested experimentally by transmitting plane electromagnetic waves through such a structure. Insights gained from these experiments could, in turn, shed light on the scattering of other massless fields (e.g., gravitational waves) by actual black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Mini-extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs), composed of a stellar-mass compact object and a much lighter companion, are promising sources of continuous gravitational waves in the frequency band of ground-based interferometers such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. Such systems, consisting of sub-solar-mass compact objects, provide a unique probe of exotic compact objects, including primordial black holes. Detecting such long-lived signals, however, remains challenging. Here, we adapt standard methods used in searches for quasi-monochromatic signals to search for mini-EMRIs, and derive a statistical framework that explicitly handles spectral leakage. In particular, we introduce a new method that sums along the tracks in the time-frequency plane carved out by possible mini-EMRI signals, which we call $\Sigma$Track. This refinement establishes a general basis for analyzing long-duration transient signals with rapid frequency evolutions, regardless of the underlying mechanism for gravitational-wave emission. We also compute a new semi-analytic sensitivity estimate within our new statistical framework, which is valid under the assumption that the signal is weak with respect to the noise level. We then establish a statistic that quantifies how to discretize the search parameter space for our method, which works for mini-EMRIs, as well as arbitrary signal types. Our results provide a foundation for mini-EMRI searches and demonstrate the potential of current ground-based detectors to probe the existence of sub-solar-mass compact objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Mini-Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals (mini-EMRIs), comprising a sub-solar exotic compact object (such as a primordial black hole or boson star) orbiting a much heavier stellar-origin or exotic compact object, represent key targets for ground-based gravitational-wave detectors to probe the early universe and the nature of dark matter. However, detecting such systems, which could spend hours to years in LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA data, poses a computational challenge to standard matched-filtering methods. However, semi-coherent methods are constrained by the quasi-monochromatic assumption, which restricts the coherence time to avoid spectral leakage caused by frequency evolution. In this work, we extend the development of our method, $\Sigma$Track, to the regime in which the quasi-monochromatic approximation is relaxed, in two ways. First, we establish an analytical model for the spectral leakage, extending the validity of conventional analyses beyond the quasi-monochromatic regime. Second, we propose the $\Sigma R$ statistic -- a novel detection metric formed by a weighted summation of power ratios -- which effectively recovers the signal energy dispersed across adjacent frequency bins. Building on this framework, we further introduce an innovative frequency-layered search strategy that dynamically optimizes the coherence time across the observation band. We benchmark our method against a globally optimized Hough transform pipeline using a fiducial mini-EMRI signal from a binary with masses $(1.5, 10^{-5})\,M_\odot$. The results demonstrate that our framework achieves an order-of-magnitude enhancement in the effective detection volume, significantly expanding the horizon for discovering mini-EMRIs and sub-solar exotic compact objects with ground-based gravitational wave detectors. This approach can be similarly applied to EMRI searches for future space-based gravitational wave detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 A tertiary body near a coalescing binary can imprint its influence on the gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by that binary in the form of center-of-mass (CoM) acceleration. An example of such a scenario is a binary black hole (BBH) merging near a supermassive black hole, which is touted to occur frequently. The limited low-frequency sensitivity of current GW detectors makes it challenging to detect these effects, as the associated waveform phase remains elusive. However, next-generation (3G) detectors such as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), with improved sensitivity at lower frequencies, are expected to be capable of capturing such signatures. In our study, we focus on the stellar-mass BBHs and explore the parameter space where the CoM acceleration will play a dominant role affecting parameter inference of the binary. We demonstrate that an unaccounted CoM acceleration of a low-mass binary with a total mass of $5\, \rm{M}_{\odot} $ can lead to significant systematic biases, exceeding statistical errors in the estimation of the chirp mass and symmetric mass ratio when the CoM parameter $\alpha$ is as small as $\sim 10^{-9}$ and $10^{-10}$ $\rm{s}^{-1}$ for CE and ET, respectively. We also find that asymmetric binaries are more susceptible to systematic bias when CoM acceleration is neglected. When the effect of CoM acceleration is included in the GW phase, then $\alpha = 10^{-7} \rm s^{-1}$ can be constrained with a bound of $10^{-9} (10^{-11})\, \rm s^{-1}$ for CE (ET). Our study thus highlights the crucial implications of considering the presence of a tertiary body in the GW emitted by a stellar-mass BBH when observed in 3G detectors.

 We study thermodynamic properties and the entanglement island of a black hole in asymptotically safe quantum gravity, analyzing key thermodynamic quantities such as the Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and entropy, as well as the mass-horizon radius relation. Unlike Schwarzschild black holes, the temperature decreases with mass near the evaporation endpoint, signaling a phase transition and possible stable remnant. The entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation is obtained both with and without island contributions. Without islands, the radiation entropy grows linearly indefinitely, leading to the information paradox. By including island contributions and extremizing the generalized entropy functional, we resolve this paradox. At late times, the radiation entropy saturates at the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, confirming unitary evolution. From this, we derive the Page time and scrambling time by equating early- and late-time entanglement entropies. The result of this study establishes the finiteness of the radiation entropy and consistency with quantum mechanics.

 - **Abstract**
 A classical result by Penrose establishes that null geodesics generating a black hole event horizon can only intersect at their entrance to the horizon in ``crossover'' points. This points together with limit points of this set, namely caustics, form the so-called "crease set". Light rays enter into the horizon through the crease set, characterizing the latter as the birth of the horizon. A natural question in this context refers to the classification and stability of the structural possibilities of black hole crease sets. In this work we revisit the strategy adopted by Gadioux & Reall for such a classification in the setting of singularity theory in contact geometry. Specifically, in such contact geometry setting, the event horizon is identified as a component (not connected to null infinity) of a so-called ``BigFront''. The characterization of BigFronts as Legendrian projections of Legendrian submanifolds permits to classify the crease sets and ``cuspidal sets'' (or caustics in Penrose's terminology) by applying classical results established by V.I. Arnol'd. Here we refine the stability discussion presented by Gadioux & Reall of that connected component of the crease set that is not causally connected to null infinity and that constitutes the event horizon birth. In addition, we identify the existence of other components of the crease set that lie in the part of the BigFront that is causally connected to null infinity.

 - **Abstract**
 The region near a black hole horizon may be modified by quantum gravity effects that resolve the singularity. Such geometry may be represented by an exotic compact object. Because the horizon is enclosed by a photon sphere, it is difficult to probe this region directly. In this paper, we develop a method to study the region inside the photon sphere by applying the AdS/CFT correspondence. We extract signatures of the modified geometry from the retarded Green functions of the dual conformal field theory. The retarded Green functions can be computed from bulk wave functions of scalar field. We show that exotic compact objects leave two characteristic imprints: bulk-cone singularities and echoes. The bulk-cone singularities correspond to null geodesics in the bulk, allowing us to detect null trajectories that are specific to exotic compact objects. The echoes arise from wave modes trapped inside the photon sphere, and thus signal the absence of a horizon. As concrete examples, we study AdS gravastar and AdS wormhole. We compute the corresponding bulk wave functions both via the WKB approximation and through numerical analysis and observe the bulk-cone singularities and echoes explicitly.

 - **Abstract**
 We establish an exact duality between the extended thermodynamics of five-dimensional charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes and the thermodynamic framework of the dual boundary conformal field theory (CFT). The thermodynamics of the dual CFT involves two central charges originating from the trace anomaly. We demonstrate a precise correspondence between the extended first laws on the bulk and boundary sides. Moreover, the topological charges of the CFT thermodynamics, associated with the phase transition and critical point, coincide with those of the corresponding bulk black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate the existence of a pair of almost dissipationless oscillating modes at low temperatures in both the shear and sound channels of a hybrid quantum system, comprised of a weakly self-interacting perturbative sector coupled to strongly self-interacting holographic degrees of freedom described by a black hole geometry. We argue that these modes realize prethermal time-crystal behavior in semiholographic systems without fine-tuning and can be observed by measuring operators that probe either the hard (perturbative) or the soft (holographic) sector. We also find novel Gregory Laflamme type instabilities that lead to the formation of inhomogeneities at higher temperatures. These results provide evidence that black holes with planar horizons and dynamical boundary conditions can develop both inhomogeneous and metastable time crystal phases over a wide range of temperatures set by an intermediate scale. Furthermore, they suggest that such phases can be realized without external driving in nonAbelian plasmas of asymptotically free gauge theories in the large-$N$ limit.
