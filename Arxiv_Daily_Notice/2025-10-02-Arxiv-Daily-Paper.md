#### Dark forces suppress structure growth

 - **Abstract**
 No experimental test precludes the possibility that the dark matter experiences forces beyond general relativity -- in fact, a variety of cosmic microwave background observations suggest greater late-time structure than predicted in the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model. We show that minimal models of scalar-mediated forces between dark matter particles do not enhance the growth of unbiased tracers of structure: weak lensing observables depend on the total density perturbation, for which the enhanced growth of the density contrast in the matter era is cancelled by the more rapid dilution of the background dark matter density. Moreover, the same background-level effects imply that scenarios compatible with CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies in fact suppress structure growth, as fixing the distance to last scattering requires a substantially increased density of dark energy. Though massive mediators undo these effects upon oscillating, they suppress structure even further because their gravitational impact as nonclustering subcomponents of matter outweighs the enhanced clustering strength of dark matter. We support these findings with analytic insight that clarifies the physical impact of dark forces and explains how primary CMB measurements calibrate the model's predictions for low-redshift observables. We discuss implications for neutrino mass limits and other cosmological anomalies, and we also consider how nonminimal extensions of the model might be engineered to enhance structure.

#### Irony at z=6.68: a bright AGN with forbidden Fe emission and multi-component Balmer absorption

 - **Abstract**
 We present the deepest medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy to date of a bright Little Red Dot (LRD) AGN, Irony at z=6.68. The data reveal broad Balmer emission from H$\alpha$-H$\delta$ and Balmer absorption in H$\alpha$-H$\epsilon$. The absorption lines are kinematically split: H$\alpha$ is blueshifted while higher-order lines are redshifted suggesting complex gas kinematics; their relative ratios are inconsistent with a single, passive absorbing screen. The line depths require absorption of both the BLR and the continuum, ruling out a stellar origin, consistent with the smooth Balmer break. We fit the broad H$\gamma$-H$\alpha$ lines and find the data favor a double-Gaussian effective profile, although exponential wings are evident. Depending on the adopted profile, single-epoch virial estimates give log(M$_\bullet$/M$_\odot$)=7.86-8.39 and $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$=1.7-0.4. The dynamical mass implied by the narrow lines is low log(Mdyn/M$_\odot$)=9.1, suggesting an overmassive black hole. The narrow lines display little attenuation, A$_V<0.5$ mag; while broad H$\alpha$/H$\beta\sim9$ and the broad Balmer decrements are inconsistent with standard dust attenuation curves, suggesting collisional processes. The forbidden-line spectrum includes auroral [S II] and [N II], and a forest of [Fe II] lines. Line ratios and kinematics indicate a stratified narrow-line region with both low (n$_{\rm e}$=420 cm$^{-3}$) and high densities (n$_{\rm e}\gtrsim 6.3\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$). We detect metal absorption lines in both the optical (Ca II and Na I) and UV range (Fe II UV1-UV3). Our results support a picture of a compact AGN embedded in a dense, high covering-factor and stratified cocoon, with complex neutral-gas kinematics. While the choice of broad-line profile affects the virial estimates of M$_\bullet$, we find the effect to be of order 0.6 dex between the different approaches.

 - **Abstract**
 The population of the Little Red Dots (LRDs) may represent a key phase of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. A cocoon of dense excited gas is emerging as key component to explain the most striking properties of LRDs, such as strong Balmer breaks and Balmer absorption, as well as the weak IR emission. To dissect the structure of LRDs, we analyze new deep JWST/NIRSpec PRISM and G395H spectra of FRESCO-GN-9771, one of the most luminous known LRDs at $z=5.5$. These reveal a strong Balmer break, broad Balmer lines and very narrow [O III] emission. We unveil a forest of optical [Fe II] lines, which we argue is emerging from a dense ($n_{\rm H}=10^{9-10}$ cm$^{-3}$) warm layer with electron temperature $T_{\rm e}\approx7000$ K. The broad wings of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ have an exponential profile due to electron scattering in this same layer. The high $\rm H\alpha:H\beta:H\gamma$ flux ratio of $\approx10.4:1:0.14$ is an indicator of collisional excitation and resonant scattering dominating the Balmer line emission. A narrow H$\gamma$ component, unseen in the other two Balmer lines due to outshining by the broad components, could trace the ISM of a normal host galaxy with a star formation rate $\sim5$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The warm layer is mostly opaque to Balmer transitions, producing a characteristic P-Cygni profile in the line centers suggesting outflowing motions. This same layer is responsible for shaping the Balmer break. The broad-band spectrum can be reasonably matched by a simple photoionized slab model that dominates the $\lambda>1500$ Å continuum and a low mass ($\sim10^8$ M$_{\odot}$) galaxy that could explain the narrow [O III], with only subdominant contribution to the UV continuum. Our findings indicate that Balmer lines are not directly tracing gas kinematics near the SMBH and that the BH mass scale is likely much lower than virial indicators suggest.

 - **Abstract**
 Interpreting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of astrophysical objects with physically motivated models is computationally expensive. These models require solving coupled differential equations in high-dimensional parameter spaces, making traditional fitting techniques such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo or nested sampling prohibitive. A key example is modeling non-thermal emission from blazar jets - relativistic outflows from supermassive black holes in Active Galactic Nuclei that are among the most powerful emitters in the Universe. To address this challenge, we employ machine learning to accelerate SED evaluations, enabling efficient Bayesian inference. We generate a large sample of lepto-hadronic blazar emission models and train a neural network (NN) to predict the photon spectrum with strongly reduced run time while preserving accuracy. As a proof of concept, we present an NN-based tool for blazar SED modeling, laying the groundwork for future extensions and for providing an open-access resource for the astrophysics community.

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid appearance of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at $z\gtrsim7$ requires efficient pathways to form massive black hole seeds. We investigate whether annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can alter primordial (Pop III.1) protostellar evolution sufficiently to enable formation of such `heavy'' seeds. Using the one-dimensional Geneva stellar-evolution code (GENEC) with an implemented Gould single-scatter capture module, we compute a grid of protostellar evolution models covering ambient WIMP mass densities $\rho_\chi=10^{12}$-$10^{16}\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$, WIMP masses $m_\chi=30$-$3000\ \mathrm{GeV}$, spin-dependent cross sections $\sigma_{\rm SD}=10^{-42}$-$10^{-40}\ \mathrm{cm^2}$, and baryonic accretion rates $\dot{M_*}=(1-3)\times10^{-3}\, M_\odot \,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. We find a robust bifurcation of outcomes. For sufficiently high ambient dark matter density ($\rho_\chi\gtrsim5\times10^{14}\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$) and capture efficiency ($\sigma_{\rm SD}\gtrsim10^{-41}\ \mathrm{cm^2}$) WIMP annihilation supplies enough energy to inflate protostars onto extended, cool (Hayashi-track) configurations that dramatically suppress ionizing feedback and permit uninterrupted growth to $\sim10^{5}\,M_\odot$. Lighter WIMPs and larger $\sigma_{\rm SD}$ favour earlier and stronger annihilation support; heavier WIMPs delay the effect. For our fiducial case, WIMP masses $<$3 TeV are essential for allowing growth to the supermassive regime, otherwise the protostar evolves to the compact, feedback-limited regime that results in `light'' seeds. These results indicate that, under plausible halo conditions, DM annihilation provides a viable channel for forming heavy black hole seeds.

#### Inconsistencies of Tsallis Cosmology within Horizon Thermodynamics and Holographic Scenarios

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the cosmological implications of Tsallis entropy in two widely discussed settings: the Cai--Kim thermodynamic derivation of the Friedmann equations and the holographic dark energy (HDE) scenario with the Hubble scale as infrared cutoff. In both cases, the dynamics introduce a nonextensivity parameter $\delta$, with standard $\Lambda$CDM recovered for $\delta=1$. Previous studies have argued that only small deviations from extensivity are observationally allowed, typically constraining $|1 - \delta| \lesssim 10^{-3}$. In this work we go further and present, for the first time, a systematic consistency analysis across the entire expansion history. We show that even mild departures from $\delta=1$ lead to pathological behavior in the effective dark energy sector: its density becomes negative or complex, its equation of state diverges, or alternatively it contributes an unacceptably large early--time fraction that spoils radiation domination and violates BBN and CMB bounds. Our results sharpen and unify earlier hints of tension, providing a clear physical explanation in terms of corrections that grow uncontrollably with expansion rate toward the past. We conclude that, within both the Cai--Kim and HDE frameworks, viable cosmology is realized only in the extensive limit, effectively collapsing the models back to $\Lambda$CDM. More broadly, our findings call attention to the importance of dynamical consistency and cosmological viability tests when assessing nonextensive entropies as possible explanations of the Universe's dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Currently the asteroid mass window (mass $\sim 10^{17}- 10^{21}$ grams) remains unconstrained for Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) to make up all of the dark matter content of the universe. Given these PBHs have very small masses, their Hawking temperature can be up to hundreds of keV. This study investigates the potential impacts of PBH Hawking radiation on the intergalactic medium from $z\sim 800-25$, namely studying the ionization history, kinetic gas temperature, and ultimately the 21 cm signature. We find that for masses on the low edge of the asteroid mass window, there are up two orders of magnitude increases in the ionization fraction and kinetic gas temperature by redshift 25, and the 21 cm spin temperature can differ from non-PBH cosmology by factors of a few. This analysis results in maximum differential brightness temperatures of +17 mK for our lightest PBH masses of $2.12\times 10^{16}$g. We also show maximal $53$ mK discrepancies in differential brightness temperatures between our PBH and non-PBH cosmologies for our lightest PBH mass, while our heaviest PBH mass of $1.65 \times 10^{17}$g shows only $0.5$ mK variations. We find the Hawking-radiated electrons and positrons are instrumental in driving these IGM modifications. This study shows the necessity for a rigorous treatment of Hawking radiation in PBH cosmological observables from the dark ages through cosmic dawn.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore novel classes of exotic astrophysical sources capable of producing ultra-high-energy gamma rays extending beyond the PeV scale, motivated by quantum gravity scenarios and dark matter phenomenology. These sources include: ultra-spinning black hole vortex-string systems; exotic compact objects such as boson star, axion star and Q-ball. Such Exotica generate powerful magnetic fields through interactions with millicharged dark matter, enabling particle acceleration mechanisms that surpass the energy limits of conventional astrophysical sources like pulsar wind nebulae and supernova remnants. We demonstrate that such exotic PeVatrons could be distributed throughout our Galaxy and may be detectable by current (LHAASO, HAWC) and next-generation (CTA) gamma-ray observatories.

#### Serendipitous Discovery of an Optically-Dark Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxy at $z$ = 3.4

 - **Abstract**
 Dusty, submillimeter-selected galaxies without optical counterparts contribute a non-negligible fraction of the star formation in the early universe. However, such a population is difficult to detect through classical optical/UV-based surveys. We report the serendipitous discovery of such an optically dark galaxy, behind the quadruply-lensed $z=2.56$ quasar, H1413+117, offset to the north by 6\arcsec. From $^{12}$CO $J=4$--3, $J=6$--5, and part of the $J=13$--12 transitions, which all spatially coincide with a compact submillimeter continuum emission, we determine an unambiguous spectroscopic redshift, $z=3.386\pm 0.005$. This galaxy has a molecular mass $M_{\rm mol} \sim 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ and a black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{8}$ M$_\odot$, estimated from $^{12}$CO $J=4$--3 and archival {\it Chandra} X-ray data ($L_{\rm 2-10,keV} \sim 4 \times 10^{44}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$), respectively. We also estimate a total infrared luminosity of $L_{\rm FIR} = (2.8\pm{2.3}) \times 10^{12}$ L$_\odot$ and a stellar mass of $M_* \lesssim 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, from spectral energy distribution fitting. According to these simple mass estimations, this gas-rich and X-ray bright galaxy might be in a transition phase from starburst to quasar offering a unique case for studying galaxy-black hole co-evolution under extremely dusty conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of supermassive black holes with masses $\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$ challenges conventional formation scenarios based on baryonic accretion and mergers within the first few hundred million years. We propose an alternative channel in which ultralight scalar dark matter undergoes dark-to-black conversion via quasi-bound state depletion around black hole seeds. We estimate the accretion rate of the scalar field as a function of the boson mass parameter $\mu$ and the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}$, and integrate this rate over cosmological timescales. Our results show that once a critical value of $\mu M_{\rm BH}$ is reached, scalar field accretion becomes highly efficient, enabling substantial black hole growth even from relatively small initial seed masses. For boson masses $\mu \sim 10^{-19}-10^{-16}\,\mathrm{eV}$, black hole seeds of $10^2-10^5 M_\odot$ can reach $10^6-10^8 M_\odot$ within $\sim 10^8$ yr. This dark-to-black mechanism provides a natural pathway for the rapid formation of massive black holes in the early universe, offering a potential probe of the microphysical nature of dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 Non-jetted AGN exhibit hard X-ray emission with a power law spectrum above $\sim$2 keV, which is thought to be produced through Comptonization of soft photons by electrons and positrons (pairs) in the vicinity of the black hole. The origin and composition of this plasma source, known as the corona, is a matter open for debate. Our study focuses on the role of relativistic protons accelerated in black-hole magnetospheric current sheets in the neutrino production of AGN coronae. We present a model that has two free parameters, namely the proton plasma magnetization $\sigma_{\rm p}$, which controls the peak energy of the neutrino spectrum, and the Eddington ratio $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ (defined as the ratio between X-ray luminosity $L_{\rm X}$ and Eddington luminosity $L_{\rm Edd}$), which controls the amount of energy transferred to secondary particles. Furthermore, we combine our coronal model with an AGN population in order to provide a prediction for the diffuse neutrino flux measured on Earth. We compare our results with the observational data by IceCube and we find a satisfactory agreement on both the flux value and the slope of the neutrino distribution when we assume a $\sigma_{\rm p}$ value of $10^5$ for all the sources in our sample.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of the X-ray binary system XTE~J1550-564, with the primary objective of analyzing the evolution of the black hole's spin parameter. To achieve this objective, we embarked on the necessary step of identifying a plausible progenitor for the system. Using a set of models covering various parameter combinations, we were able to replicate the system's observed characteristics within acceptable error margins, including fundamental parameters such as component masses, orbital period, donor luminosity, and effective temperature. The model results indicate the possibility of diverse evolutionary pathways for the system, highlighting the significant role played by the initial mass of the donor star and the efficiency of mass transfer episodes. While some models are well-aligned with estimates of the mass transfer rate, they all fall short of explaining the black hole's observed moderate spin ($a^* = 0.49$). We also explored alternative magnetic braking prescriptions, finding that only an extreme and fully conservative scenario, based on the convection and rotation boosted prescription, can reproduce the observed spin and only in a marginal way. Our study attempts to shed light on the complex dynamics of black hole X-ray binaries and the challenges of explaining their observed properties with theoretical models.

#### The gas streamer G1-2-3 in the Galactic Center

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole in the Galactic Center, Sgr A*, is prototypical for ultra-low-fed galactic nuclei. The discovery of a hand-full of gas clumps in the realm of a few Earth masses in its immediate vicinity provides a gas reservoir sufficient to power Sgr A*. In particular, the gas cloud G2 is of interest due to its extreme orbit, on which it passed at a pericenter distance of around 100 AU and notably lost kinetic energy during the fly-by due to the interaction with the black hole accretion flow. 13 years prior to G2, a resembling gas cloud called G1, passed Sgr A* on a similar orbit. The origin of G2 remained a topic of discussion, with models including a central (stellar) source still proposed as alternatives to pure gaseous clouds. Here, we report the orbit of a third gas clump moving again along (almost) the same orbital trace. Since the probability of finding three stars on close orbits is very small, this strongly argues against stellar-based source models. Instead, we show that the gas streamer G1-2-3 plausibly originates from the stellar wind of the massive binary star IRS16SW. This claim is substantiated by the fact that the small differences between the three orbits - the orientations of the orbital ellipses in their common plane as a function of time - are consistent with the orbital motion of IRS 16SW.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio synchrotron emission originates from both massive star formation and black hole accretion, two processes that drive galaxy evolution. Efficient classification of sources dominated by either process is therefore essential for fully exploiting deep, wide-field extragalactic radio continuum surveys. In this study, we implement, optimize, and compare five widely used supervised machine-learning (ML) algorithms to classify radio sources detected in the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE)-COSMOS survey as star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Training and test sets are constructed from conventionally classified MIGHTEE-COSMOS sources, and 18 physical parameters of the MIGHTEE-detected sources are evaluated as input features. As anticipated, our feature analyses rank the five parameters used in conventional classification as the most effective: the infrared-radio correlation parameter ($q_\mathrm{IR}$), the optical compactness morphology parameter (class$\_$star), stellar mass, and two combined mid-infrared colors. By optimizing the ML models with these selected features and testing classifiers across various feature combinations, we find that model performance generally improves as additional features are incorporated. Overall, all five algorithms yield an $F1$-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) $>90\%$ even when trained on only $20\%$ of the dataset. Among them, the distance-based $k$-nearest neighbors classifier demonstrates the highest accuracy and stability, establishing it as a robust and effective method for classifying SFGs and AGN in upcoming large radio continuum surveys.

#### Quasar Main Sequence unfolded by 2.5D FRADO (Natural expression of Eddington ratio, black hole mass, and inclination)

 - **Abstract**
 The quasar main sequence (QMS), characterized by the Eigenvector 1 (EV1), serves as a unifying framework for classifying type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on their diverse spectral properties. Although a fully self-consistent physical interpretation has long been lacking, our physically motivated 2.5D FRADO (Failed Radiatively Accelerated Dusty Outflow) model naturally predicts that the Eddington ratio ($\dot{m}$) is the primary physical driver of the QMS, with black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and inclination ($i$) acting as secondary contributors. We employed a dense grid of FRADO simulations of the geometry and dynamics of the broad-line region (BLR), covering a representative range of $M_{\rm BH}$ and $\dot{m}$. For each simulation, we computed the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the H$\beta$ line under different $i$. The resulting FWHM--$\dot{m}$ diagram closely resembles the characteristic trend observed in the EV1 parameter space. This establishes the role of $\dot{m}$ as the true proxy for the Fe II strength parameter ($R_{\rm Fe}$), and vice versa. Our results suggest that $\dot{m}$ can be regarded as the sole underlying physical tracer of $R_{\rm Fe}$ and should therefore scale directly with it. The $M_{\rm BH}$ accounts for the virial mass-related scatter in FWHM, while $i$ acts as a secondary driver modulating $R_{\rm Fe}$ and FWHM for a given $\dot{m}$ and $M_{\rm BH}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) created by stellar core-collapses throughout cosmic history is on the verge of discovery, with SK-Gd showing early deviations from the background expectation and JUNO starting to take data. However, the interpretation of early DSNB data will face significant challenges due to degeneracies between astrophysical parameters and uncertainties in supernova neutrino modeling. We explore how complementary astronomical observations can break these degeneracies and, in this context, we investigate whether early DSNB observations can constrain invisible supernovae, which have no optical emission but are powerful neutrino sources before being swallowed by a forming black hole. Leveraging the differences in the spectra between invisible and visible supernovae, we estimate the sensitivity of 1) detecting the existence of invisible supernovae, and 2) determining the fraction of invisible supernovae. Finally, we discuss how these conclusions depend on the spectral parameters of the black hole-forming component.

 Mounting evidence indicates that some of the gravitational wave signals observed by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observatories might arise from eccentric compact object binaries, increasing the urgency for accurate waveform models for such systems. While for non-eccentric binaries, surrogate models are efficient and accurate, the additional features due to eccentricity have posed a challenge. In this letter, we present a novel method for decomposing eccentric numerical relativity waveforms which makes them amenable to surrogate modelling techniques. We parameterize the inspiral in the radial phase domain, factoring out eccentricity-induced dephasing and thus enhancing compressibility and accuracy. This is combined with a second surrogate for the merger-ringdown in the time-domain and a novel technique to take advantage of the approximate periodicity with radial oscillations during the inspiral. We apply this procedure to the $(2,2)$ mode for non-spinning black hole binaries, and demonstrate that the resulting surrogate, NRSurE_q4NoSpin_22, is able to faithfully reproduce the underlying numerical relativity waveforms, with maximum mismatches of $5\times10^{-4}$ and median mismatches of $2\times10^{-5}$. This technique paves the way for high-accuracy parameter estimation with eccentric models, a key ingredient for astrophysical inference and tests of general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 Surrogate modeling of eccentric binary black hole waveforms has remained challenging. The complicated morphology of these waveforms due to the eccentric orbital timescale variations makes it difficult to construct accurate and efficient surrogate models, especially for waveforms long enough to cover the sensitivity band of the current ground-based gravitational wave detectors. We present a novel and scalable surrogate building technique which makes surrogate modeling of long-duration eccentric binary black hole waveforms both feasible and highly efficient. The technique aims to simplify the harmonic content of the intermediate eccentric surrogate data pieces by modeling them in terms of an angular orbital element called the mean anomaly, instead of time. We show that this novel parameterization yields an order of magnitude fewer surrogate basis functions than using the contemporary parameterization in terms of time. We show that variations in surrogate data-pieces across parameter space become much more regular when expressed in terms of the instantaneous waveform eccentricity and mean anomaly, greatly easing their parameter-space fitting. The methods presented in this work make it feasible to build long-duration eccentric surrogates for the current as well as future third-generation gravitational wave detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the motion of test particles in quantum-gravitational backgrounds by introducing the concept of q--desics, quantum-corrected analogs of classical geodesics. Unlike standard approaches that rely solely on the expectation value of the spacetime metric, our formulation is based on the expectation value of quantum operators, such as the the affine connection-operator. This allows us to capture richer geometric information. We derive the q--desic equation using both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods and apply it to spherically symmetric static backgrounds obtained from canonical quantum gravity. Exemplary results include, light-like radial motion and circular motion with quantum gravitational corrections far above the Planck scale. This framework provides a refined description of motion in quantum spacetimes and opens new directions for probing the interface between quantum gravity and classical general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 Given the vast distances between stars in the Milky way and the long timescales required for interstellar travel, we consider how a civilization might overcome the constraints arising from finite lifespans and the speed of light without invoking exotic or novel physics. We consider several scenarios in which a civilization can migrate to a time-dilated frame within the scope of classical general relativity and without incurring a biologically intolerable level of acceleration. Remarkably, the power requirements are lower than one might expect; biologically tolerable orbits near the photon radius of Sgr A* can be maintained by a civilization well below the Type II threshold, and a single Type II civilization can establish a galaxy-spanning civilization with a time dilation factor of $10^4$, enabling trips spanning the diameter of the Milky way within a human lifetime in the civilizational reference frame. We also find that isotropic monochromatic signals from orbits near the photon radius of a black hole exhibit a downward frequency drift. The vulnerability of ultrarelativistic vessels to destruction, combined with the relatively short timescales on which adversarial civilizations can arise, provides a strong motivating element for the ``dark forest'' hypothesis.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical relativity (NR) provides the most accurate waveforms for comparable-mass binary black holes but becomes prohibitively expensive for increasingly asymmetric mass ratios. Point-particle black hole perturbation theory (ppBHPT), which expands the Einstein equations in the small-mass-ratio limit, offers a computationally efficient alternative but is expected to break down in the comparable-mass regime because it neglects nonlinear effects. Nonetheless, several recent studies have shown that ppBHPT can model non-spinning binaries with high accuracy when supplemented by simple calibrations or a first post-adiabatic (PA) correction. Here we assess the applicability of ppBHPT to quasi-circular binaries with a spinning primary by comparing waveform amplitudes, orbital frequencies, and orbital phases. We find that spin effects in ppBHPT waveforms (without additional spin information beyond adiabatic order) are in surprisingly close agreement with the corresponding NR calculation (outperforming some post-Newtonian models) over the last $\approx 20$ orbital cycles. This suggests that, after incorporating higher-order corrections into ppBHPT waveforms in the non-spinning limit -- via second-order self-force results or semi-analytical fits -- only modest spin-dependent adjustments may be required to achieve NR-faithful ppBHPT waveforms. We also show that combining non-spinning NR information with adiabatic ppBHPT can provide a reasonably accurate inspiral waveform for spins $\chi \lesssim 0.5$ mass ratios $q \gtrsim 5$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a unified framework for non-singular bouncing cosmologies in modified gravity, combining $f(R,G,T)$ geometry with quintom scalar dynamics in a flat FLRW universe. While single-field models achieve phantom divide line (PDL) crossing and stable bounces, our $f(R,G,T)$-quintom coupling provides a novel implementation of a \textit{double} PDL crossing of $\omega_{\text{eff}}$ during the bounce. We address stability concerns through Hamiltonian analysis, showing that FLRW symmetry constraints suppress Ostrogradsky instabilities by reducing higher-derivative terms to metric invariant. The scalar field equation of motion is explicitly derived, confirming cancellation of pathological modes. Numerical reconstruction of five $f(R,G,T)$ models confirms non-singular bounces with $\rho_{\text{eff}}>0$ and $c_s^2 \geq 0$, alongside parametric control over energy condition violations. Our work extends prior studies by: (1) unifying early-time bounce dynamics with late-time dark energy, (2) demonstrating a novel double-PDL crossing signature compatible with FLRW stability, and (3) establishing explicit ghost-free criteria for higher-derivative terms.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate asymptotic Schwarzschild exterior solutions in the context of modified gravity theories, specifically within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, where the asymptotic behavior recovers the standard Schwarzschild solution of General Relativity. Unlike previous studies that rely mainly on analytical approximations, our approach combines asymptotic analysis with numerical integration of the underlying differential equations. Using these solutions, we analyze strong lensing effects to obtain the photon sphere radius and the corresponding capture parameter. Considering rings produced by total reflection, we define the photon sphere width as the difference between the first total reflection and the capture parameter; and study how it is modified in the $f(R)$ scenario. Our results show that the photon sphere width increases in the presence of $f(R)$-type modifications, indicating deviations from GR that could be observable in the strong-field regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Quantum effects in general induce scale dependence in the coupling constants. We explore this possibility in gravity, with a scale-dependent Newton coupling. When applied to Kerr black holes with such a running coupling, the consistency of black hole thermodynamics requires that the Newton coupling have a specific dependence on the black hole parameters. In this work, we consider such a class of Newton couplings and look for the possible observational implications on the highly lensed images of the black holes. In addition to placing constraints on the parameter space of the model through the latest Sgr A* images, we find that the variations in the shape of shadows in a large portion of the parameter space can be qualitatively captured by a quantity solely defined by the event horizon. Most importantly, the consistency of thermodynamics suggests a lower bound on the shadow size, beyond which either horizon disappears, or the shadow cannot keep the standard D-shaped structure. The possibility that the black holes in this model could spin faster than the Kerr bound, and the physical implications of the resulting cuspy shadows, are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on a novel set of very-high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (VHFQPO's) in the context of compact, non-singular horizonless objects. Focussing on the static, spherically symmetric case we utilize metrics of non-singular black holes that are accompanied by a regulator length scale $L > 0$. The choice $L \gtrsim GM$ generically removes the horizon from these metrics leading to compact, horizonless but non-singular objects. This generically guarantees the existence of a stable orbit at small radii $r \ll r_\text{ISCO}$, independent of the angular momentum of the massive particle. Crucially, the absence of a horizon allows the resulting VHFQPO's to escape to infinity, spanning the range from 1kHz ($M = 10M_\odot$) to 25 kHz ($M = 2M_\odot$). Within the paradigm of non-singular spacetime geometries, the absence of such VHFQPO's from X-ray binary spectra implies the presence of a horizon around the central, compact object.

 - **Abstract**
 The horizon of a black hole, the "surface of no return," is characterized by its rotation frequency $\Omega_H$ and surface gravity $\kappa$. A striking signature is that any infalling object appears to orbit at $\Omega_H$ due to frame dragging, while its emitted signals decay exponentially at a rate set by $\kappa$ as a consequence of gravitational redshift. Recent theoretical work predicts that the merger phase of gravitational waves from binary black hole coalescences carries direct imprints of the remnant horizon's properties, via a "direct wave" component that (i) oscillates near $2\Omega_H$, reflecting the horizon's frame dragging and the quadrupole nature of the gravitational radiation, and (ii) decays at an increasing rate characterized by $\kappa$, with additional screening from the black hole's potential barrier. In this paper, we report observational evidence for the direct wave in GW250114 with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of $14.0^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ ($13.5^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$) in the LIGO Hanford (Livingston) detector. The measured properties are in full agreement with theoretical predictions. These findings establish a new observational channel to directly measure frame-dragging effects in black hole ergospheres and explore (near-)horizon physics in dynamical, strong-gravity regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 We axial perturbations of Reissner-Nordström black holes within the framework of Chern-Simons modified gravity, a theory with includes parity violation. We derive the governing equations for the perturbations, focusing on the radial function $R(r)$ and its behavior across distinct regions: near the singularity ($r \rightarrow 0$), between the inner and outer Reissner-Nordström horizons ($r_-< r< r_+$), and in the asymptotic regime ($r \rightarrow \infty$). Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we analyze the solutions for varying black hole charge-to-mass ratios ($Q/M$) and angular momentum parameters ($l$). Key findings include the suppression of perturbations by the electromagnetic field for higher $Q/M$; the emergence of radial resonance-like behavior for specific $l$ values; and a high degree of symmetry for solutions in the extremal limit ($Q/M \sim 1$), attributed to the AdS$_2 \times S^2$ near-horizon geometry. The WKB approximation is employed to study high-$l$ regimes, revealing quantized radial modes and singular behavior in the extremal limit. Additionally, we explore the role of boundary conditions and the Chern-Simons scalar field $\Theta$, showing that consistency demands a constant field (and thus no actually observable Chern-Simons effects) in this perturbative framework. These results provide insights into the stability and dynamical properties of charged black holes under axial perturbations.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the quantum chaotic behavior of black holes within the brickwall model, focusing on probe scalar fields in ($d+1$)-dimensional hyperbolic AdS black holes. The brickwall model has captured the normal modes of BTZ black holes ($d=2$) with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon and their connection to quantum chaos signatures of random matrix theory. Here, we extend this framework to higher-dimensional AdS black holes ($d>2$), exploring how black hole normal modes encode chaotic dynamics across dimensions and examining the universality of this approach. We show that quantum chaos is prominent in lower dimensions and persists in higher dimensions. Specifically, deviations from the logarithmic spectrum in $d=2$ evolves into a power-law spectrum at higher $d$, highlighting the sensitivity of black hole normal modes to dimensionality, while retaining signatures of quantum chaos despite the spectral deformation. Our results are supported by conventional diagnostics, including level spacing distributions and spectral form factors, as well as modern tools like Krylov complexity. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the brickwall model in capturing chaotic behavior in the parametrically large dimension limit, where the spectrum becomes constant leading to degeneracy and a non-chaotic regime, while emphasizing its effectiveness as a tool for studying quantum aspects of black holes in moderate higher dimensions.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop the on-shell action formalism within Worldline Quantum Field Theory (WQFT) to describe scattering of spinning compact bodies in General Relativity in the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion. The real on-shell action is constructed from vacuum diagrams with causal (retarded) propagators from which scattering observables such as momentum impulse and spin kick follow via Poisson brackets of the initial scattering data. Furthermore, we explore the implications of unitarity at the level of the worldline and show how generalised unitarity techniques can be adapted to WQFT to efficiently compute multi-loop contributions. Our work establishes a concrete link between WQFT and amplitude-based methods, elucidating how unitarity cuts ensure equivalence between the on-shell action derived from either approach. Extending the state-of-the-art, we complete the full on-shell action -- including dissipative terms -- at (formal) 3PM order and up to quartic spin interactions on both massive bodies.
