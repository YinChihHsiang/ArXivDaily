 - **Abstract**
 One striking feature of binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed in the first decade of gravitational-wave astronomy is an excess of events with component masses around $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Multiple formation channels have been proposed to explain this excess. To distinguish among these channels, it is essential to examine their predicted population-level distributions across additional parameters. In this work, we focus on BBH mergers near the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak and infer the population distributions of primary mass ($m_1$), mass ratio ($q$), effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$), and redshift ($z$). We observe a gradual increase in the merger rate with $m_1$, rising by a factor of $3$ from $20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ to a peak around $34\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, followed by a sharp, order-of-magnitude decline by $50\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. This population also shows a weak preference for equal-mass mergers and has a $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution skewed toward positive values, with a median of zero excluded at approximately $90\%$ confidence. We find no significant $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation in the $35\, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak population, suggesting that lower-mass systems ($m_1<20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) likely drive the $q-\chi_{\rm eff}$ anti-correlation observed in the full BBH merger catalog. The redshift evolution of the merger rate is consistent with the cosmic star formation rate. We compare our findings with predictions from a wide range of formation channels. We find that common variants of the pair-instability supernova scenario, as well as hierarchical merger models, are incompatible with the observed features of the $35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ population. Ultimately, none of the formation channels we consider can explain all or even most of the features observed in this population. The ''mid-thirties'' of black hole mergers are in crisis.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational potential of supermassive black holes is so powerful that it triggers some of the most intense phenomena in the Universe. Accretion onto these objects and relativistic jet emission from their vicinity are observable across a wide range of frequencies and throughout cosmic history. However, despite this wealth of data, many aspects of their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Investigating this phenomena across all frequencies is crucial, yet some energy windows are still poorly explored. One such window is the MeV energy range: many key signatures related to the emission from the SMBH environment - both in quiescent and active phases - are expected to lie between one and several hundreds MeV. In this work, we explore some of the open questions regarding the behavior and emission processes in the surroundings of SMBHs, and how these questions might be approached. From the elusive nature of Fermi bubbles around our Galactic Centre, to the origin of high-energy neutrinos in the nuclei and jets of Active Galactic Nuclei, to the nature and emission mechanisms of the most powerful blazars, the MeV window stands out as a crucial key to understanding SMBH physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Many theoretical and observational studies have suggested that galaxy mergers may trigger enhanced star formation or active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity. We present an analysis of merging and nonmerging galaxies from $0.2 \leq z \leq 3$ in the IllustrisTNG50 simulation. These galaxies encompass a range of masses ($M_\star > 10^{8}M_\odot$), multiple merger stages, and mass ratios ($\geq1:10$). We examine the effect that galaxy mergers have on star formation and black hole accretion rates in the TNG50 universe. We additionally investigate how galaxy and black hole mass, merger stage, merger mass ratio, and redshift affect these quantities. Mergers in our sample show excess specific star formation rates (sSFR) at $z \leq 3$ and enhanced specific black hole accretion rates (sBHAR) at $z \lesssim 2$. The difference between sSFRs and sBHARs in the merging sample compared to the non-merging sample increases as redshift decreases. Additionally, we show that these enhancements persist for at least $\sim1$ Gyr after the merger event. Investigating how mergers behave in the TNG50 simulation throughout cosmic time enables both a better appreciation of the importance of spatial resolution in cosmological simulations and a better basis to understand our high-$z$ universe with observations from \textit{JWST}.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated universal relations for compact stars rotating at the Keplerian (mass-shedding) limit, which is highly relevant for understanding the rapidly rotating objects formed in the aftermath of a neutron star-neutron star merger. Our analysis is based on a set of nucleonic EoS featuring systematic variations in the symmetry energy slope parameter $L_{\rm sym}$ and the isoscalar skewness parameter $Q_{\rm sat}$, varied within ranges that are broadly consistent with current laboratory and astrophysical constraints. The global observable properties of isolated maximally rotating stars are examined, focusing on the mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, quadrupole moment, and the Keplerian (maximum) rotation frequency, as well as their variations in the $L_{\rm sym}$-$Q_{\rm sat}$ parameter space. Next, we demonstrate that, in the limit of Keplerian rotation, universal relations remain valid across the same set of EoSs characterized by varying $L_{\rm sym}$ and $Q_{\rm sat}$. In particular, we present explicit results for the moment of inertia and quadrupole moment as functions of compactness, as well as for the moment of inertia - quadrupole moment relation. All of these relations exhibit excellent universality, with deviations typically within a few percent and rarely exceeding 10\% across a wide range of parameters. These findings support the applicability of $I$-Love-$Q$-type universal relations in observational modeling of maximally rotating compact stars and the gravitational wave emitted by them, when accounting for significant variation in the symmetry energy and high-density behavior of the nuclear EoS.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational wave event GW230529 was the first compact binary merger observation reported in the fourth observing run of the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observatory network. The more massive component of the GW230529 source binary was inferred to contain a compact object in the lower mass gap, a purported gap between the most massive neutron stars and least massive black holes based on compact object observations in the Milky Way. However, the properties of the mass-gap object, such as its exact mass and spin, remain unresolved due to statistical uncertainties. To investigate the properties of the GW230529 source binary, we perform parameter estimation on a suite of simulated gravitational wave systems with similar parameters. We vary the intrinsic properties of the simulated systems, the detector noise properties, the signal-to-noise ratios, and the waveform model used in recovery. We find that the low signal-to-noise ratio of GW230529 is the key reason for the ambiguity in determining whether the mass of the primary object in the binary is consistent with a low-mass black hole or a high-mass neutron star, since the priors for the masses and spins have a significant impact on the posterior distribution. The inclusion of tidal effects in the waveform model also contributes to the observed degeneracies in the posteriors. We show that a higher signal-to-noise ratio in future observations of mass-gap gravitational wave sources will increase the precision of the measurements and allow us to determine whether the components are black holes or neutron stars.
#### Radio emission from tidal disruption events produced by the collision between super-Eddington outflows and the circumnuclear medium

 - **Abstract**
 In this Letter, we simulate the collision between outflows from the tidal disruption of a 1M$_\odot$ main sequence star around a $10^6$M$_\odot$ black hole and an initially spherically symmetric circumnuclear cloud. We launch super-Eddington outflows self-consistently by simulating the disruption of stars on both bound and unbound initial orbits using general relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics. We find shocks formed as early as $\sim 10~$days after the initial stellar disruption produce prompt radio emission. The shock radius ($\approx~10^{17}$~cm), velocity ($\sim 0.15$c) and total energy ($\sim 10^{51}$ erg) in our simulations match those inferred from radio observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs). We ray-trace to produce synthetic radio images and spectra to compare with the observations. While the TDE outflow is quasi-spherical, the synchrotron emitting region is aspherical but with reflection symmetry above and below the initial orbital plane. Our synthetic spectra show continuous decay in peak frequency, matching prompt radio TDE observations. Our model supports the hypothesis that synchrotron radio flares from TDEs result from the collision between outflows and the circumnuclear material.
#### The Evolutionary Pathway of Low-mass Supermassive Black Holes at Intermediate Redshift: Insights from the JADES Survey

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the relationship between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies at different redshifts is crucial for unraveling the processes of SMBH-galaxy co-evolution. We present the properties of nine type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at intermediate redshift ($2<z<4$) using the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). All of them show the significant $\mathrm{H\alpha}$ broad line and the AGN contribution in spectral energy distribution. Our sample covers SMBH masses of $10^{6.1-8.2}\ M_\odot$ and stellar masses of $10^{9.3-11.0}\ M_\odot$, comparable to those of the AGNs observed in the local universe. In the low-mass SMBH regime ($<10^{8}\ M_\odot$), the BH-to-stellar mass ratios in our sample ($0.01-0.1\%$) differ from those of the AGNs at $z>4$ ($1-10\%$), suggesting that black holes and galaxies may trace different evolutionary pathways at intermediate and high redshift. We also perform 2D image decomposition using GALFIT to constrain the bulge mass by evaluating the bulge contribution in the rest-frame near-infrared flux. We identify the AGNs with low BH-to-bulge mass ratios compared to those observed in the nearby bulge-dominant galaxies. This finding suggests the existence of a galaxy-first evolutionary path, in which bulge formation occurs before substantial gas is efficiently accreted onto the central engine.
#### Primordial Black Holes as Coma Cluster Dark Matter and the Unresolved γ-Ray Background

 - **Abstract**
 If 0.1% of the dark matter in the Coma cluster is constituted by primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses ranging from 10^-19 to 10^-17 solar masses, then the observed GeV {\gamma}-ray emission from the cluster could potentially be attributed to Hawking radiation. The emitted spectrum is inversely proportional to the black hole's mass, meaning lighter PBHs radiate at higher energies, potentially falling within the GeV range. If 0.1% of the Coma cluster's dark matter is PBH in this mass range, a fit to the cluster's GeV emission is obtained. We then investigate the potential for constraining evaporating PBHs through cross-correlations between the Unresolved Gamma-Ray Background and weak gravitational lensing. Utilizing 12 years of Fermi-LAT observations and weak lensing measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3, we assess whether such correlations can reveal a PBH {\gamma}-ray component. While a statistically significant correlation between the UGRB and large-scale structure has been observed, this signal is consistent with emission from clustered astrophysical sources such as blazars. Attributing a measurable fraction of the UGRB to PBH evaporation would require unrealistically large PBH abundances. We also draw attention to a cluster of Coma-like X-ray clusters, designated Draco X, observed at a redshift of z = 0.12. These systems, characterized by their significant X-ray emission from hot, diffuse intracluster gas, represent massive gravitationally bound structures. The existence and properties of such clusters at these redshifts provide crucial cosmological probes, offering insights into the formation and evolution of large-scale structure and the underlying cosmological parameters. Further investigation of Draco X and similar high-redshift clusters would yield additional constraints on large scale structure.
#### Nonlinear reconstruction of general dark energy theories

 - **Abstract**
 The large variety and number of dark energy (DE) theories make it impractical to perform detailed analyses on a case-by-case basis, which has motivated proposals to ``parameterize" theories to reduce the size of theory space. The leading approach to do this is the effective field theory of dark energy (EFTofDE), which can describe general Horndeski-type theories with a small number of observationally accessible time-dependent functions. However, the EFTofDE primarily works for linear perturbations, and extending it to obtain a fully non-linear description of DE theories, which is critical for theories with screening mechanisms, is challenging. In this paper, we present a general method for reconstructing the non-linear DE Lagrangian from the background expansion history and certain linear-perturbation quantities, building upon the EFTofDE framework. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate that this method is applicable to a wide range of single-scalar-field dark energy and modified gravity theories, including quintessence, scalar-tensor theory, $k$-essence, and generalized cubic Galileon with shift symmetry. For each of these theories, we discuss the validity of the method and factors affecting its results. While this method involves solving differential equations, we find that the initial conditions are not important for quintessence, scalar-tensor theory and $k$-essence, while for shift-symmetric cubic Galileon, the generic tracker solution can help transform differential equations into algebraic equations. This offers a useful framework to connect cosmological observations at the background and linear-perturbation levels to the underlying non-linear dynamics of dark energy, and will enable cosmological simulations to analyze and examine DE theories systematically and in much greater detail.

 - **Abstract**
 The orbit of the S2 star around Sagittarius A* provides a unique opportunity to test general relativity and study dynamical processes near a supermassive black hole. Observations have shown that the orbit of S2 is consistent with a Schwarzschild orbit at a 10$\sigma$ confidence level, constraining the amount of extended mass within its orbit to less than 1200 M$_\odot$, under the assumption of a smooth, spherically symmetric mass distribution. In this work we investigate the effects on the S2 orbit of granularity in the mass distribution, assuming it consists of a cluster of equal-mass objects surrounding Sagittarius A*. Using a fast dynamical approach validated by full N-body simulations, we perform a large set of simulations of the motion of S2 with different realizations of the cluster objects distribution. We find that granularity can induce significant deviations from the orbit in case of a smooth potential, causing precession of the orbital plane and a variation of the in-plane precession. Interactions with the cluster objects also induce a sort of "Brownian motion" of Sagittarius A*. Mock data analysis reveals that these effects could produce observable deviations in the trajectory of S2 from a Schwarzschild orbit, especially near apocenter. During the next apocenter passage of S2 in 2026, astrometric residuals in Declination may exceed the astrometric accuracy threshold of GRAVITY of about 30 $\mu as$, as it happens in 35 to 60% of simulations for black holes of 20 to 100 M$_\odot$. This presents a unique opportunity to detect, for the first time, scattering effects on the orbit of S2 caused by stellar-mass black holes, thanks to the remarkable precision achievable with GRAVITY. We also demonstrate that any attempt to constrain the extended mass enclosed within the orbit of S2 must explicitly account for granularity in the stellar-mass black hole population.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation and growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remain a significant unsolved problem in astrophysics, particularly in the low-mass regime, where observations are sparse. The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), with its diffraction-limited imaging and high-resolution UV-optical spectroscopy, presents a unique opportunity to explore the demographics of massive black holes (MBHs) in nearby dwarf galaxies. We propose a program to dynamically detect quiescent MBHs with masses as low as $10^{4.5} \, \rm M_\odot$ in galaxies within $10-30$ Mpc, by resolving stellar velocity dispersions down to 30 $\rm km \, s^{-1}$. This effort will dramatically extend current black hole-host galaxy scaling relations into the dwarf regime, probing the fundamental connection between black hole seeds and their environments. Using a volume-limited sample of $\sim 100$ dwarf galaxies drawn from existing catalogs, HWO will resolve the gravitational sphere of influence of MBHs and enable precision measurements of stellar kinematics via Ca II triplet absorption lines. These observations will test predictions from competing seed formation scenarios -- light seeds from Population III remnants versus heavy seeds from direct collapse -- and clarify whether dwarf galaxies retain imprints of their initial black hole population. The results will offer critical insight into SMBH formation channel and the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies across cosmic time.
#### Icarus's Orbit as the Ultimate Test for the Vulcan Hypothesis and General Relativity

 - **Abstract**
 General Relativity (GR) quantitatively accounts for the anomalous perihelion precession observed in several planets' orbits, with Mercury exhibiting the most significant deviation from Newtonian predictions. In the present work, I carry out an in-depth study comparing methods for calculating perihelion advance of inner planets using two methods, one based on the rotation of the Laplace-Runge-Lentz vector and the other on the evolution of the perihelion longitude. I show that, although the two methods predict almost identical perihelion advances for inner planets according to classical gravitational theory and the general relativity model, they give divergent results for the asteroid Icarus. Comparing numerical calculations of Icarus'perihelion advance with those predicted by Einstein's formula leads to the conclusion that only the method based on the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector offers a consistent explanation for the behavior of Icarus' perihelion advance. By incorporating the hypothetical planet Vulcan into the Newtonian gravitational model and analyzing its influence on the perihelion advances of the inner planets, I find that carefully selecting Vulcan's mass and orbital parameters yields a delicate balance between its semi-major axis and mass necessary to simultaneously match the observed perihelion advances of the inner planets. Vulcan, orbiting at a semi-major axis of 0.545 AU and possessing about one-third the mass of Mercury, could exert gravitational effects on Earth and Mars comparable to those predicted by GR. This Vulcan would cause an effect on Icarus' perihelion advance approximately nine times greater than the relativistic effect. Thus, precise observational data of Icarus's orbital dynamics offers a definitive means to either rule out this specific Vulcan hypothesis or, conversely, indicate the necessity of further refinement of GR's applications.
#### DESI DR2 reference mocks: clustering results from Uchuu-BGS and LRG

 - **Abstract**
 The aim of this work is to construct mock galaxy catalogues that accurately reproduce the redshift evolution of galaxy number density, clustering statistics, and baryonic properties, such as stellar mass for luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and absolute magnitude in the $r$-band for the bright galaxy sample (BGS), based on the first three years of observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). To achieve this, we applied the subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) technique to the Uchuu $N$-body simulation, which follows the evolution of 2.1 trillion particles within a volume of $8\,h^{-3}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{3}$, assuming a Planck base-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Using SHAM, we populated Uchuu subhalos with LRGs and BGS-BRIGHT ($r<19.5$) galaxies up to redshift $z=1.1$, assigning stellar masses to LRGs and luminosities to BGS galaxies (up to $M_{\rm r}\leq 20$). Furthermore, we analyzed the clustering dependence on stellar mass and luminosity for each tracer. Our results show that the Uchuu BGS-BRIGHT and LRG mocks accurately reproduce the observed redshift evolution of clustering, with better than 5\% agreement for separations of $1<r<20\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and below 10\% for $0.1<r<1\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. For the Uchuu-LRG mock, we successfully captured the stellar mass dependence of clustering, while for the Uchuu-BGS mock, we replicated the clustering for various volume-limited subsamples. We also find good agreement between the data and mocks in the dependence of large-scale bias on luminosity for BGS-BRIGHT galaxies and on stellar mass for LRGs. Altogether, these results equip DESI with robust tools for generating high-fidelity lightcones for the remainder of the survey, thereby enhancing our understanding of the galaxy--halo connection.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of magnetic fields observed on both astrophysical and cosmological scales is a compelling problem that has the potential to shed light on the early Universe. We analytically investigate inflationary magnetogenesis in scenarios where a brief departure from slow-roll inflation - akin to mechanisms proposed for primordial black hole formation - leads to enhanced magnetic field generation with a growing power spectrum. Focusing on the Ratra model, we derive an analytic bound on the growth of the magnetic field power spectrum in this context, showing that the spectral index can reach $d \ln {\cal P}_B / d \ln k = 4.75$ during the growth phase. This growth enables amplification from CMB-safe large-scale amplitudes to values of astrophysical relevance. We further compute the stochastic gravitational wave background sourced by the resulting magnetic fields, incorporating their rich spectral features. Under suitable conditions, the induced signal exhibits a characteristic frequency dependence and amplitude within reach of future gravitational wave observatories, providing a distinctive signature of this mechanism and a specific class of templates for upcoming gravitational wave searches.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical objects in our universe that are too faint to be directly detectable exist and are important - an obvious example being dark matter. The same can also apply to very faint baryonic objects, such as low luminosity dwarf galaxies and gravitationally compact objects (e.g., rogue planets, white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, dark sirens). While they are very difficult to observe directly, they have locations that are highly important when studying astrophysical phenomena. Here, we use a machine learning algorithm known as symbolic regression to model the probability of a dark object's existence as a function of their separation distances to their closest two ``bright" (directly observable) neighbors, and the distances of these bright objects to each other. An advantage of this algorithm is that it is interpretable by humans and can be used to make reproducible predictions. Galaxies with masses above $10^9 M_{\odot}$ and halos above $10^{12} M_{\odot} $ are the objects that we separate into ``bright" and ``dark" to be used in our analysis. We find that it is possible to predict the density of dark objects using an analytic expression that depends on their distances to their closest bright neighbors in Illustris-TNG galaxy formation simulations, which is significantly better than the (linear) scale-dependent biasing prediction for $k \sim 1.0~ h$Mpc$^{-1}$ (and potentially beyond, if allowed by the resolution). This could potentially open the avenue for finding dark objects based on their vicinity to directly observable bright sources and make future surveys more targeted and efficient.

 - **Abstract**
 Assuming a minimal $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with three massive neutrinos, the joint analysis of Planck cosmic microwave background data, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and distance moduli measurements of Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ sample sets an upper bound on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06$-$0.07$ eV, that lies barely above the lower limit from oscillation experiments. These constraints are mainly driven by mild differences in the inferred values of the matter density parameter across different probes that can be alleviated by introducing additional background-level degrees of freedom (e.g., by dynamical dark energy models). However, in this work we explore an alternative possibility. Since both $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and massive neutrinos critically influence the growth of cosmic structures, we test whether the neutrino mass tension may originate from the way matter clusters, rather than from a breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM expansion history. To this end, we introduce the growth index $\gamma$, which characterizes the rate at which matter perturbations grow. Deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM value ($\gamma \simeq 0.55$) can capture a broad class of models, including non-minimal dark sector physics and modified gravity. We show that allowing $\gamma$ to vary significantly relaxes the neutrino mass bounds to $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.13$-$0.2$ eV, removing any tension with terrestrial constraints without altering the inferred value of $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$. However, this comes at the cost of departing from standard growth predictions: to have $\sum m_\nu \gtrsim 0.06$ eV one needs $\gamma > 0.55$, and we find a consistent preference for $\gamma > 0.55$ at the level of $\sim 2\sigma$. This preference increases to $\sim 2.5$-$3\sigma$ when a physically motivated prior $\sum m_\nu \ge 0.06$ eV from oscillation experiments is imposed.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-gas kinematic misalignments are a transient phenomenon observed in $\sim11\%$ of the local galaxy population. According to current models, misaligned gas is expected to lose angular momentum and relax into the galactic plane on timescales of $\sim0.1$ Gyr, driving gas toward the central regions of the galaxy. Recent observational studies have found a higher incidence of active galactic nuclei in misaligned galaxies. We use the EAGLE simulation to explore the connection between stellar-gas misalignments and enhanced central black hole (BH) activity between $0<z<1$. We use a sample of $\sim5600$ galaxies with a stellar mass of $M_{*}\geqslant \mathrm{10^{9.5}}$ M$_\odot$ that feature long-lived stellar-gas alignment, counter-rotation, and unstable misalignments (non-coplanarity). Over time windows of $0.5$ Gyr, we find that galaxies experiencing an unstable misalignment have systematically enhanced BH growth during relaxation. Galaxies with long-term counter-rotation show little difference in BH growth compared to aligned galaxies. We suggest that this enhanced BH growth is driven by loss of angular momentum in unstable misaligned gas discs which is able to drive gas inward toward the vicinity of the BH. At $z\approx0.1$, we find a greater incidence of overmassive BHs in galaxies that have spent a greater fraction of time with unstable stellar-gas kinematic misalignments over the preceding $\approx2$ Gyr compared to control samples of aligned galaxies. In agreement with observations, we conclude that BH activity is enhanced in misaligned systems in EAGLE and suggest that the presence of overmassive BHs may be indicative of a past stellar-gas kinematic misalignment.

 - **Abstract**
 We have studied the effect of radiation in the interacting barrow holographic dark energy model for a non-flat universe. For both open and closed universes, we have obtained the evolution equation for the density parameters for dark energy, dark matter and radiation for a specific kind of interaction among the seven possible linear interactions; the analysis with the remaining six interactions will be updated soon in this manuscript. We have then numerically solved those coupled differential equations to show their behaviour with the redshift parameter. We have also found different epochs corresponding to dark energy-dark matter, dark energy-radiation and dark matter-radiation crossings. We have also obtained various observational constraints for our interacting Barrow holographic dark matter model using the Cosmic chronometer data and BAO data. In the upcoming version of the manuscript, we will add the observational constraints of our model using Pantheon data, also several calculations of other interaction scenarios will be added.

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs) of binary black holes with mass ratios $10^{-4}\lesssim q \lesssim 0.1$ are astrophysically interesting sources of gravitational waves. Mergers of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with stellar-mass black holes would be IMRIs, so their detection can help us probe the formation mechanisms of IMBHs. They can also help us perform precise tests of general relativity due to the presence of strong higher-order mode emission. We perform a search for aligned-spin IMRIs within the data of the two LIGO detectors in the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration, including higher modes in the template banks for the first time. We use the IAS-HM pipeline for our search and construct template banks in the range $1/100 < q<1/18$ using the SEOBNRv5HM waveform model. Our banks retain a similar level of effectualness for IMRPhenomXHM and BHPTNRSur2dq1e3 waveforms, making our search results relatively robust against waveform systematics. We show that the sensitivity volume of the search increases by up to $\sim 500\%$ upon inclusion of higher modes. We do not find any significant candidates with inverse false alarm rate (IFAR) $> 1$ year in the O3 data. This gives us upper limits on the IMRI merger rate in the local Universe, ranging from $\sim 30$ to $10^3$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ depending on the masses of the black holes in the binary. These constraints are consistent with rate predictions in the literature. Our projections indicate that we would be able to detect IMRIs or constrain some of their proposed formation channels in the fourth (O4) and fifth (O5) observing runs.

 - **Abstract**
 Systems of two black holes with unbound orbits can produce a diverse array of gravitational wave signals with rich morphology. This parameter space encompasses both hyperbolic orbit scattering events and dynamical captures, including zoom-whirl orbits with multiple flybys and direct plunge mergers. These signals challenge traditional parameter estimation infrastructure, which is largely optimized for quasicircular inspiral binaries. In this work we discuss the adaptation of the Rapid Iterative FiTting (RIFT) algorithm to this problem using the TEOBResumSDALI waveform model which can simulate generic orbits. We present results from a study of simulated signals emulating a scatter and plunge event, utilizing the design sensitivity of the forthcoming Cosmic Explorer interferometer. Our analysis demonstrates that RIFT accurately recovers the mass, spins, and hyperbolic orbit parameters: the system energy and angular momentum defined at a fiducial initial separation.

 - **Abstract**
 The planned space-based gravitational wave detector, LISA, will provide a fundamentally new means of studying the orbital alignment of close white dwarf binaries. However, due to the inherent symmetry of their gravitational wave signals, a fourfold degeneracy arises in the transverse projections of their angular momentum vectors. In this paper, we demonstrate that by incorporating timing information from electromagnetic observations, such as radial velocity modulations and light curves, this degeneracy can be reduced to twofold.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave astronomy provides a promising avenue for the discovery of new physics beyond general relativity as it probes extreme curvature and ultra-relativistic dynamics. However, in the absence of a compelling alternative to general relativity, it is difficult to carry out an analysis that allows for a wide range of deviations. To that end, we introduce a Gaussian process framework to search for deviations from general relativity in gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole mergers with minimal assumptions. We employ a kernel that enforces our prior beliefs that - if gravitational waveforms deviate from the predictions of general relativity - the deviation is likely to be localised in time near the merger with some characteristic frequency. We demonstrate this formalism with simulated data and apply it to events from Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 3. We find no evidence for a deviation from general relativity. We limit the fractional deviation in gravitational-wave strain to as low as 7% (90% credibility) of the strain of GW190701_203306.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider background fields within the gravitational sector of the Standard-Model Extension (SME) in a cosmological setting. Our analysis is divided into two parts. The first part addresses the consistency of nondynamical backgrounds in scenarios where diffeomorphism invariance is explicitly broken. Focusing on gravitational systems that admit Killing vector fields and possess a priori symmetries, we demonstrate that potential discrepancies between Riemannian geometry and dynamical equations can be avoided. The second part presents a direct application of various techniques developed by decomposing the modified Einstein equations along normal and tangential directions of the (3+1) decomposition. We show that nondynamical backgrounds can lead to accelerated cosmological expansion without requiring a cosmological constant, thereby opening new avenues for interpreting dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the stationary, uncharged, rotating, vacuum solution to Weyl conformal gravity. We elucidate the causal and ergoregion structure of the spacetimes found in the parameter space of the metric for positive mass. These are then compared to the corollary Kerr, Kerr-de Sitter, and Kerr-Anti-de Sitter solutions to general relativity. Additionally, we investigate and derive the extremal limits for both the horizons and ergosurfaces of the spacetimes.
#### Superradiant Axionic Black-Hole Clouds as Seeds for Graviton Squeezing

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01689

 - **Abstract**
 It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01698

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of the quasinormal modes of a new class of nonlocal static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions within the framework of the revised Deser-Woodard theory of gravity. These solutions are constructed as linear perturbations of the Schwarzschild spacetime and are characterized by an inverse power-law behavior of the lapse metric function. We derive the radial profiles of the effective potentials corresponding to scalar, electromagnetic and axial gravitational fluctuations on the BH background. Using the WKB method, complemented by Padé approximants to regularize the trend of the effective potential near its peak, we compute the complex quasinormal mode frequencies associated with each type of perturbation. Our results are examined from both mathematical and physical perspectives, and are substantiated with references to existing literature. In particular, we compare the numerical outcomes with the predictions of the Schwarzschild metric to quantify deviations from the framework of general relativity. When all types of perturbations are combined, the relative deviations of the fundamental modes can reach up to $\sim 12\%$. Finally, we discuss the possibility to place observational bounds in the BH parameter space, based on the predicted sensitivities of future gravitational wave detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a fully analytical approach to calculate the nonlinearities of the gravitational waves in the ringdown of a Kerr black hole in the eikonal limit. The corresponding quasi-normal modes are associated to the orbits of a closed circular null geodesic and the problem can be analyzed by taking the Penrose limit around it. We calculate analytically the amplitude and the phase of the quadratic quasi-normal modes as well as its dependence on the black hole spin.
#### Dirty Black Holes, Clean Signals: Near-Horizon vs. Environmental Effects on Grey-Body Factors and Hawking Radiation

 - **Abstract**
 Grey-body factors are not only essential ingredients for computing the intensity of Hawking radiation, but also serve as characteristics of black hole's geometry that are closely related to their quasinormal modes. Importantly, they tend to be more stable under small deformations of the background spacetime. In this work, we carry out a detailed analysis of grey-body factors and Hawking radiation for a spherically symmetric black hole subject to localized deformations which do not alter the Hawking temperature: near-horizon modifications to simulate possible new physics or matter fields, and far-zone perturbations to model environmental or astrophysical effects. We show that environmental deformations have only a minor impact on the grey-body factors and Hawking radiation--unless the additional potential barrier created by the environment becomes comparable in height to the primary peak associated with the black hole itself, a scenario more relevant to nonlinear dynamics. In contrast, near-horizon deformations significantly affect the Hawking spectrum, particularly in the low-frequency regime.
