#### Radiation pressure role in accreting massive black hole binaries

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of radiation pressure on the circumbinary discs surrounding accreting massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at milli-parsec separations, using 3D hyper-Lagrangian resolution hydrodynamic simulations. The circumbinary discs in our simulations evolve under an adiabatic equation of state. The gas temperature is therefore allowed to change through viscous heating, black-body cooling and self-gravity. We take a significant step further by including the contribution of radiation pressure in the simulations. We model binaries with a total mass of $10^6 \, M_{\odot}$, eccentricities $e=0,0.45,0.9$ and mass ratios $q= 0.7, 1$. We find that the radiation pressure significantly alters the vertical and thermal structure of the disc, resulting in a geometrically thinner, therefore colder configuration. This leads to a reduced accretion rate onto the binary and suppresses cavity eccentricity growth and precession in circular equal mass binaries. The binary eccentricity remains approximately constant, while the semi-major axis decreases over time due to net negative torque, regardless of the initial binary orbital parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 If dark matter (DM) exists in halos around rotating neutron stars (NSs), it will be essential to understand the effects of rotation on the distribution of DM and baryonic matter (BM) in the stars to interpret observations. In this work, we construct rapidly rotating dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) with DM halos using the two-fluid approximation, where the BM and DM interact only through gravity. Our goal is to describe rapidly rotating millisecond-period DANS spun up by the accretion of BM from a zero angular momentum state. We extend the Rapidly Rotating Neutron Star (RNS) code to compute axisymmetric configurations in which the BM rotates rigidly while the DM remains torque-free and differentially rotates through the frame-dragging of spacetime. For the first time, we examine in detail local and global definitions of mass in general relativity for two-fluid systems, showing how their differences affect the interpretation of baryonic and dark component masses. We compute energy density and frame-dragging frequency profiles for DANS with three different characteristic DM halos. We demonstrate that rapid BM rotation reduces DM halo sizes if central energy densities are kept constant between non-rotating and rotating models. We also construct sequences of DANS to create mass and radius curves and compare rotating and non-rotating cases. Finally, we quantify deviations in the spacetime metric outside the baryonic surfaces of these sequences of stars caused by the DM halos. We hypothesize that the size of this quantity could indicate whether a DM halo will significantly impact X-ray pulse profile modeling. These results provide a framework for assessing the observational consequences of DM halos around rapidly rotating NSs.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmography is a model-independent phenomenological approach to observational cosmology, relying on Taylor series expansions of physical quantities as a function of the cosmological redshift or other analogous variables. A recent work developed the formalism for a cosmographic analysis of astrophysical and local measurements of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, and provided first constraints on the corresponding parameters. Here we update the earlier work, both by including more recent measurements of $\alpha$, and by extending it to other fundamental dimensionless couplings. We find no statistically significant evidence for such variations, and place stringent constraints on the first two terms of all these cosmographic series: the linear coefficient in the $\alpha$ series is constrained to parts per billion level, thanks to recently improved atomic clock constraints, while the other coefficients are constrained to parts per million level. Additionally, we use the same data to place cosmographic constraints on models from a broad class of Grand Unified Theories in which varying fundamental constants occur, and highlight how future data can provide a discriminating cosmographic test between freezing and thawing dark energy models.

 - **Abstract**
 Differential heating and radiation on asymmetric asteroids can cause measurable changes in their rotation rates and spin axes, known as the YORP effect. In binary systems, such radiation-driven torques can change the mutual asteroid orbits, termed the binary YORP or BYORP effect. To study how binary asteroid shapes and thermophysical properties affect surface temperatures and BYORP, we developed a new 3D thermophysical model which balances insolation, 1D conduction, visible light reflection, and mutual heating through scattered infrared radiation. Using 3D ray tracing, we include eclipses, shadowing from horizons and topography, and mutual radiation exchange between the primary and secondary asteroids. We perform global modeling of the binary asteroid (175706) 1996 FG3, a Janus mission target. At perihelion, we find that the 1996 FG3 system experiences temperatures between 100 and 475 K. We find that eclipses and thermal inertia can alter secondary surface temperatures by up to 14%, with a mean difference due to radiation from the primary of just over 1%. We also present a model for calculating the BYORP effect using binary thermophysical model results. This model compares well to analytical approximations of the BYORP coefficient B, and suggests that thermal effects like eclipses and thermal inertia can reduce torque in the 1996 FG3 system and alter the BYORP coefficient by up to several percent. For 1996 FG3, eclipses alter B by approximately 7%, resulting in a lower torque on the secondary. Though small, in the absence of tidal effects this would reduce the contraction of the semimajor axis by about 20 meters over 10,000 years. Our findings suggest that thermal effects can alter temperatures and BYORP calculations sufficiently that they should be included when modeling binaries. The relative importance of each effect is predicted to vary with the properties of the studied system.

#### X-BPASS : Self-consistent modelling of stellar populations and their associated X-ray Binary emission in a binary stellar evolution framework

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray binaries play a significant role in the thermal and ionization history of galaxies. Their X-ray luminosity can shed light on galactic star formation rates and histories. Compact objects are also crucial in the evolution of gravitational wave progenitors. Here we present the results from our work to extend the binary population and spectral synthesis (BPASS) code suite to incorporate X-ray emission onto compact remnants in binary systems. We self-consistently model the accretion disc for each interacting binary system in a grid of stellar evolution models and then combine these to obtain the total X-ray spectra for stellar populations over a range of ages and metallicities. Crucially, these are estimated using the same stellar models as those used for modelling the stellar spectral energy distribution. We utilise first principle equations to calculate the X-ray binary (XRB) evolution, luminosity and spectral energy densities of individual accreting compact objects. Population synthesis using observationally motivated values for R_inner (the accretion disc inner truncation radius) reproduces the observed X-ray number evolution in the Small Magellanic Cloud and the inferred X-ray flux evolution for M51, validating our models. Using these models, we explore the implications of a self-consistent stellar and XRB emission population synthesis for ionizing photon production, the XRB dependence on metallicity and, for XRBs as a potential source of nebular He II emission seen in the spectra of high redshift galaxies. We conclude that XRBs contribute towards powering nebular He II emission without causing significant overestimates of hydrogen ionization.

#### An ALMA Band 7 survey of SDSS/Herschel quasars in Stripe 82: I. The properties of the 870 micron counterparts

 - **Abstract**
 (Abridged) Quasar studies with Herschel/SPIRE often report host luminosities ranging from 10^{12} to 10^{14} Lsun, suggestive of star formation rates (SFRs) of up to several thousand Msun/yr. Due to the limited spatial resolution of SPIRE, it is uncertain whether the far-infrared (FIR) emission originates from the quasar itself, nearby sources, or unrelated sources within the SPIRE beam. High-resolution observations at wavelengths close to the SPIRE coverage are needed to pinpoint the true source of the FIR emission. In this work we unambiguously identify the ALMA Band 7 counterparts of a statistical sample of 152 FIR-bright SDSS quasars and estimate the multiplicity rates among these systems. Based on the multiplicities, we assess the importance of mergers as triggers for concomitant accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and extreme star formation. In ~60% of cases, the submm emission originates from a single counterpart within the SPIRE beam, centred on the optical coordinates of the quasar. The multiplicity rate increases by a factor of ~2.5 between redshifts 1 and 2.5. The incidence of multiplicities is consistent among broad absorption line (BAL) quasars and non-BAL quasars. The multiplicities observed in a fraction of the sample indicate that, while mergers enhance gas inflow efficiency, there must be viable alternatives for driving synchronous SMBH growth and intense star formation in isolated systems. We report the serendipitous detection of two CO(6-5) and three CO(7-6) transitions out of the eight such transitions expected based on the spectral setup and the redshifts of the objects in the sample. Higher transitions are not detected, indicating that the quasars are not exciting sufficiently the gas in their hosts. Finally, we also detect a potential emission of H2O, HCN (10-9) or a combination of both in the spectrum of a quasar at redshift 1.67.

#### Quintessential dark energy crossing the phantom divide

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by recent results from the DESI collaboration, we explore two classes of quintessence models that can give rise to crossing of the dark energy equation of state through the ``phantom divide'' $w=-1$. These are models with Lagrangians that involve higher powers of the kinetic energy $\dot\phi^2$, or where the dark matter (DM) mass is a function of $\phi$. Both have similar features with respect to the reconstructed redshift-dependent $w(z)$: moderate tuning of parameters is required to achieve the desired shape, and it is difficult or impossible for $w(z)$ to continue evolving smoothly as $z$ becomes large. Nevertheless, they give a strong improvement over $\Lambda$CDM in fitting the data. We point out that models of coupled dark matter and dark energy that cross the phantom divide are under pressure from constraints on long-range DM forces. They rule out the simplest renormalizable coupling of scalar DM to quintessence, but leave the fermionic case marginally allowed, while exponentially coupled models are safe from current constraints.

#### Tracing Signatures of Modified Gravity in Redshift-Space Galaxy Bispectrum Multipoles: Prospects for Euclid

 - **Abstract**
 We study the galaxy bispectrum multipoles in the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity model, where a scalar degree of freedom mediates a fifth force that is screened in high-density environments. The model is specified by $f_{R0}$, the present-day background value of the scalar field, which controls the strength of deviations from General Relativity (GR). Using perturbation theory, we compute the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum with the full scale- and time-dependent second-order kernels, incorporating corrections from the scale-dependent growth rate and nonlinear screening. Expanding the bispectrum in spherical harmonics, we analyze the sensitivity of the multipoles to modified gravity and forecast their detectability in a \textit{Euclid}-like survey. The monopole ($B_0^0$) and quadrupole ($B_2^0$) show the strongest signatures, with relative deviations of $2\%$-$8\%$ at $z=0.7$ and $k_1\simeq0.3\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ for $f_{R0}=10^{-5}$. Higher multipoles provide weaker but complementary signals. Finger-of-God damping and galaxy bias significantly modulate the results, requiring joint modeling of these nuisance parameters. For \textit{Euclid}, we forecast signal-to-noise ratios up to $\sim30$ for the monopole and $\sim15$ for the quadrupole. These results demonstrate that bispectrum multipoles are a powerful probe of gravity, capable of breaking degeneracies with bias and velocity effects and strengthening constraints on deviations from $\Lambda$CDM.

#### Dark Energy Is Not That Into You: Variable Couplings after DESI DR2 BAO

 - **Abstract**
 In interacting dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) scenarios, the interaction function typically includes a coupling parameter $\xi$ that quantifies the strength of energy exchange between the dark sectors. While $\xi$ is often assumed to be constant, there is no fundamental reason to exclude a time-dependent coupling, which could provide a more general and realistic description of dark sector dynamics. In this work, we study two widely used interacting models involving pressureless DM and DE, where the coupling parameter is allowed to vary with the scale factor $a$. Specifically, we consider two parametrizations: $\xi(a) = \xi_0 + \xi_a (1-a)$ and $\xi(a) = \xi_0 \left(1 + \frac{1-a}{a^2 + (1-a)^2} \right)$, and constrain them using the latest cosmological observations, including Planck 2018 CMB data, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and multiple Type Ia supernovae samples. Our results show that one scenario yields evidence for a non-zero interaction at more than 95\% confidence level, while the remaining cases indicate at most mild or inconclusive signs of interaction. These findings highlight the potential of variable coupling models and the importance of continued investigation into the nature of the dark sectors.

#### Frequency Standard Contributions to Limitations on the Signal-to-Noise Ratio in Very Long Baseline Interferometric (VLBI) Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Since its observation in 2019, the first image of a super-massive black hole using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) with an Earth-scale baseline has generated much scientific and public interest, including the possible extension of the baseline into space to obtain higher image resolution. Operating one or more VLBI nodes in space will require the use of frequency standards that are space qualified, greatly reducing the number of options available. The coherence function C(T) is the metric usually used to determine the viability of a frequency standard. Here we show that C(T) is a useful but not sufficient metric for gauging frequency standard performance in VLBI and instead derive an expression for the clock-limited VLBI visibility S/N. We evaluate this expression for real frequency standards and find only the Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) and hydrogen maser to be viable for upcoming high-frequency VLBI with the USO only useful for very limited integration times (30s at 90 GHz, 10s at 230 GHz, 5s at 345 GHz, and not viable at 630 GHz). The maser extends these, but may have prohivitive size for a space mission. We also evaluate emerging frequency standard technologies and find the Optical Local Oscillator portion of optical clocks to be very promising (conservatively >100s at 90 GHz, 60s at 230 GHz, 40s at 345 GHz, and 22s at 630 GHz) when accounting for both performance and potential operation in space.

#### Probing the HI distribution at small scales using 21-cm Intensity Mapping at large scales

 - **Abstract**
 Neutral hydrogen (HI) 21-cm Intensity Mapping (IM) holds the potential to map the large-scale structures in the Universe over a wide redshift range $(z \lesssim 5.5)$, measure cosmological parameters, and shed light on the nature of dark energy. In addition, the signal is also sensitive to how the HI is distributed among the dark matter haloes, this being quantified through the HIHM relation, which relates the HI mass to the halo mass. In this work, we investigate whether measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum (PS) and bispectrum (BS) at large scales can be used to estimate the HIHM relation, which quantifies the HI distribution at small scales. As a proof of concept, we consider the simulated 21-cm IM signal at $z=1$. We find that the measured 21-cm PS and BS at large scales $(k \le k_{ul} = 0.32 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ are well modeled using perturbation theory, with only two free parameters namely $[\Omega_{\rm HI} b_1]$ and $\gamma = b_2/b_1$. Combining the measured 21-cm PS and BS with an independent measurement of $\Omega_{\rm HI} $, we show that it is possible to estimate the three parameters that quantify the HIHM relation. We expect observational estimates of the HIHM relation to shed light on galaxy formation and the evolution of the ISM. Our preliminary analysis ignores redshift space distortion and the system noise in IM observations, which we plan to address in future work.

#### Astrophysics informed Gaussian processes for gravitational-wave populations: Evidence for the onset of the pair-instability supernova mass gap

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19208

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the latest Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) using a flexible, non-parametric framework to infer the underlying black hole mass distribution. Our model employs Gaussian Processes (GPs) with astrophysically motivated priors to represent the mass distribution, assuming both component masses are independently drawn from a common mass function. This approach enables us to capture complex features in the population without relying on rigid parametric forms. Motivated by predictions from binary stellar evolution, we focus on the presence of a mass gap in the range $40-120~ M_\odot$, attributed to the pair-instability supernova (PISN) and pulsational PISN (PPISN) processes. Using our GP-based model, we find for the first time, strong evidence for the onset of this mass gap, locating its lower edge at approximately $45-60 ~M_\odot$. We observe a suppression in the BBH merger rate when comparing the latest constraints against our GP model, by a factor of $10-60$ at $\sim60~M_\odot$, corresponding to the minimum of the mass gap. Additionally, we find evidence of a subpopulation of mergers populating the mass gap around $70 ~M_\odot$, which we argue is due to hierarchical mergers, as well as of a feature in the $40-50~ M_\odot$ range, albeit with low significance, which we attribute to the predicted PPISN build up. We discuss the astrophysical implications of this result in light of GW231123, a recently reported BBH merger with a total mass potentially above the PISN gap, suggesting the need for revised models of massive stellar evolution or alternative formation channels.

#### Superradiance and Quasinormal Modes of Massive Scalar Fields around Kerr Black Holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion Theory with Perfect Fluid Dark Matter

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18282

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the dynamics of massive scalar fields around Kerr black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) theory, incorporating the effects of perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM), characterized by the dilaton parameter $r_2$ and the PFDM parameter $\lambda$. These parameters modify both the ergosphere and the effective potential experienced by the scalar field. Using the asymptotic matching method, we compute superradiant amplification factors, while quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies are obtained via the asymptotic iteration method (AIM). Our results reveal contrasting effects: increasing $r_2$ enhances superradiance and leads to higher QNM frequencies with greater damping, whereas increasing $\lambda$ suppresses superradiance and reduces QNM frequencies with weaker damping. In combined scenarios, the influence of $\lambda$ is found to be dominant. These findings extend the understanding of Kerr black holes in EMDA backgrounds and highlight the stabilizing role of PFDM in such systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Scalar fields with non-trivial kinetic term derived from a nonlinear sigma model are motivated by UV completions of gravity such as string theory. We discuss the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathrm{O}(3)$ sigma models with interacting potentials and simulate their full nonlinear dynamics on black hole spacetimes. We study the properties of the field as a function of the curvature of the sigma model with respect to the free massive scalar case. In the accretion process, the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ model behaves as a self-interacting field with attractive interaction, while the $\mathrm{O}(3)$ one exhibits a repulsive phenomenology. In the case of a binary black hole system, these models cause a positive or negative dephasing of the gravitational waveform, respectively, when compared to the non-interacting case and as long as the field's Compton wavelength is larger than the binary separation. We observe no bosenova emission, which suggests that nonlinearities tend to suppress this phenomenon. Our results highlight how the kinetic and potential terms are both relevant in determining the field dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 The Earth's Moon presents a uniquely advantageous environment for detecting astrophysical gravitational waves (GWs) in the frequency range of millihertz to decihertz. Unlike Terrestrial GW detectors, the quiet seismic environment of the Moon does not impede detection in this band; in fact the ground motions of the Moon will be excited by GWs, making the Moon a resonant amplifier at low frequencies. The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA) mission aims to be limited by thermal Brownian noise in its optics across most target frequencies. By taking advantage of the lunar normal mode resonances, we show that the first phase of the mission, LILA Pioneer, achieves the GW sensitivity required to study astrophysical sources through the millihertz to decihertz range. The advanced phase of the mission, LILA Horizon, would increase GW sensitivity to the cosmological horizon in this band.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.

#### Extended black hole thermodynamics in a DGP braneworld

 - **Abstract**
 Extended black hole thermodynamics, or ``black hole chemistry,'' is usually formulated in asymptotically AdS spacetimes by promoting the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ to a thermodynamic variable and identifying $P=-\Lambda/8\pi$ as the pressure. This approach, however, is less physically motivated: $\Lambda$ is a fixed coupling of the bulk action. Moreover, in de Sitter space, the construction is even more problematic due to the absence of a global timelike Killing vector and the presence of multiple horizons. In this work, we show that extended thermodynamics arises naturally in a Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) braneworld once the brane tension $\sigma$ is varied in the Iyer--Wald formalism. A positive-tension brane is dynamically stable, ghost-free, and induces a localized vacuum energy density $T^{(\sigma)}_{\mu\nu}=-\sigma g_{\mu\nu}$, corresponding to a negative pressure $P_\sigma=-\sigma$. On the normal branch, the brane is asymptotically flat with a well-defined ADM mass and a single black hole horizon, thereby avoiding the obstructions that arise in de Sitter. We demonstrate that varying $\sigma$ produces a new work term $V_\sigma\,\delta P_\sigma$ in the first law, with $V_\sigma$ reducing exactly to the geometric volume $4\pi r_h^3/3$ for a static spherical black hole. The associated Smarr relation is derived, and we show how asymptotic flatness can be maintained along the family of solutions by co-varying the bulk cosmological constant. Our results establish that extended black hole thermodynamics is not restricted to AdS spacetimes but also arises consistently in asymptotically flat braneworlds through brane tension, providing a new setting for black hole chemistry.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultralight bosons can be excited around spinning black holes via black hole superradiance. These boson clouds may play an important role in the orbital evolution of binary black holes. In this work, we investigate the formation and evolution of common envelopes of ultralight boson clouds in comparable mass-ratio black hole binaries. We describe the cloud evolution using gravitational molecular eigenstates and analyze the possible level transitions during orbital decay, as well as the impact on orbital dynamics. We find that the cloud can generally lead to eccentricity growth. In particular, the eccentricity may vary significantly during level transition, leaving an eccentricity of ${\cal O}(0.1)$ within the detection band of ground-based gravitational wave detectors.

 The eclipsing binary 2M1510 AB made of two brown dwarfs, the supermassive black hole M87* and our solar system may all have in common the presence of a massive pointlike distant companion perturbing in some ways their inner dynamics. That is, respectively, a circumbinary exoplanet whose orbital plane should be perpendicular to that of its host inner binary, an intermediate mass black hole potentially causing the observed jet precession, and a still unseen planet, known as Telisto or Planet Nine, which may, perhaps, have been recently spotted in archival images although in a quite different orbit with respect to that originally expected. To this aim, the long-term rates of change of all the Keplerian orbital elements of the relative motion of a gravitationally bound two-body system acted upon by a massive remote perturber are analytically worked out in full generality and presented in a way facilitating a straightforward application to those and other potentially interesting astronomical scenarios. For each of the considered cases, exclusion plots in their parameter spaces are provided.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the thermodynamics of $D$-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet black holes with Barrow entropy. It is found that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling and the Barrow factor revise the thermodynamic variables such as event horizon, Hawking temperature, entropy and heat capacity. It is interesting that the larger five-dimensional black holes exist stably and the smaller ones evaporate to disappear owing to the nature of heat capacities amended by the coupling and factor. The discussions exhibit that the $D$-dimensional black holes with $D=6, 7$ set free all of their energy to vanish because of the minus heat capacities as functions of Hawking temperature although the extra term and the fractal power bring about their revisions on the functions, but they cannot change the heat capacity signs, so they also cannot change the fate of six- or seven-dimensional black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the thermodynamics of a charged dilaton black hole arising from Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, where the dilaton couples exponentially to the Maxwell field via a dimensionless parameter a. Treating a as a continuous solution parameter, we extend the black hole first law to include a term Psi^A da, where Psi^A is the thermodynamic potential conjugate to a. We derive Psi^A explicitly through a differential analysis of the mass, charge, and entropy, and confirm its form via an independent Hamiltonian calculation. Additionally, by promoting a to a spacetime-dependent scalar and introducing auxiliary gauge fields, we provide a geometric interpretation of Psi^A as a conserved Noether charge. We further analyze the implications of treating a as a thermodynamic variable within the extended phase space. Despite the modification to the first law, we demonstrate that the Smarr relation remains unaffected due to the dimensionless nature of a, highlighting the distinction between variational and scaling symmetries. Our analysis supports the thermodynamic relevance of coupling constants and enriches the framework of extended black hole thermodynamics.

#### Gravitational perturbations of the Hayward spacetime and testing the correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors

 - **Abstract**
 The paper studies axial gravitational perturbations of the Hayward black hole, a regular geometry that also arises as an effective solution in asymptotically safe gravity. By computing grey-body factors with the 6th-order WKB method and comparing them to predictions based on the quasinormal modes, the correspondence between transmission coefficients and quasinormal spectra is verified. Quantum corrections, parametrized by $\gamma$, are shown to suppress both the grey-body factors and the absorption cross-section, while the correspondence remains accurate at the percent level for low multipoles and essentially exact for higher ones.

#### Long-lived quasinormal modes and echoes in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-Proca theory

 - **Abstract**
 We study quasinormal modes and time-domain profiles of a massive scalar field in the background of black holes arising in Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet--Proca gravity. The black holes in this theory possess \emph{primary Proca hair}, which modifies the effective potential and gives rise to distinctive dynamical phenomena. Using three complementary numerical techniques -- the WKB method with Padé resummation, time-domain integration, and the Frobenius (Leaver) method -- we obtain accurate spectra of quasinormal frequencies. Our analysis shows that increasing the scalar-field mass leads to arbitrarily long-lived states, known as quasi-resonances, a behavior shared by both the fundamental mode and the first overtone. The real part of the quasinormal mode decreases for the first and higher overtones and starting from the second overtone it reaches zero at some critical value of mass of the field. When the effective potential develops an additional peak, the late-time signal exhibits a sequence of echoes. Furthermore, the time-domain evolution reveals distinct regimes of intermediate power-law tails $\sim t^{-4/3-\ell}\sin(A(\mu)t)$ and a universal asymptotic tails $\sim t^{-5/6}\sin(\mu t)$.

 - **Abstract**
 The non-linearity of the theory of gravity induces a hysteresis effect in both the systems interacting with gravity and in the gravitational field. The effect is usually referred to as the memory effect. In this paper, we explore this phenomenon in the context of the dynamics of extended rotating objects in the presence of a gravitational wave pulse. Then, we consider an ensemble of such objects and show that a redistribution of spin orientations takes place as a gravitational wave passes through. We examine how this redistribution, changes the partition function and the thermodynamic quantities including entropy and energy of the system. The result shows that some information about the source of the gravitation wave is encoded in the thermodynamics of the system.
