 - **Abstract**
 The search for the model or ingredients that describe the current vision of our cosmos has led to the creation of a set of highly favorable experiments, and therefore a great flow of information. Due to this torrent of information and the need to analyze it exhaustively, the main aim of this paper is to introduce the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) as a complement to traditional cosmological data analysis. The PSO is one of the most representative Bio-inspired algorithms as provides excellent robustness in high-dimensional or complex problems with relative simplicity and small number of parameters during the implementation. In this work we implemented two versions of the canonical PSO algorithm: global best and local best, to explore dark energy models in the light of Type Ia Supernovae and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations observations, in particular, DESI and DESI+Union3 datasets. The results achieved validate the performance of the PSO algorithm in finding the best-fit parameters from observational data and confirm that PSO, under certain conditions, can deliver competitive results, at a fraction of time, compared to standard MCMC methods. Finally, the PSO output can also serve as a valuable input to the MCMC methods to speed up its analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Relations between stellar properties independent of the nuclear equation of state offer profound insights into neutron star physics and have practical applications in data analysis. Commonly, these relations are derived from utilizing various realistic nuclear cold hadronic, hyperonic, and hybrid EoS models, each of which should obey the current constraints and cover a wide range of stiffnesses. Concurrently, the field of multimessenger astronomy has been significantly enhanced by the advent of gravitational wave astronomy, which increasingly incorporates deep learning techniques and algorithms. At the same time, X-ray spectral data from NICER based on known pulsars are available, and additional observations are expected from upcoming missions. In this study, we revisit established universal relations, introduce new ones, and reassess them using a feed-forward neural network as a regression model. More specifically, we mainly propose ``deep'' EoS-insensitive hypersurface relations for rapidly rotating compact objects between several of the star's global parameters, which achieve an accuracy of within $1\%$ in most cases, with only a small fraction of investigated models exceeding this threshold. While analytical expressions can be used to represent some of these relations, the neural network approach demonstrates superior performance, particularly in complex regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, we use the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the suggested network's predictions, since is based on a strong theoretical framework inspired by the field of cooperative Game Theory. Most importantly, these highly accurate universal relations empowered with the interpretability description could be used in efforts to constrain the high-density equation of state in neutron stars, with the potential to enhance our understanding as new observables emerge.

#### Mergers Fall Short: Non-merger Channels Required for Galactic Heavy Element Production

 - **Abstract**
 Since the discovery of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and its associated kilonova, neutron star mergers have been established as a key production channel for $r$-process elements in the Universe. However, observations of $r$-process abundances as inferred from stellar spectra of Milky Way disk stars, together with chemical evolution modeling, suggest that additional channels are needed to fully account for the $r$-process element enrichment in the Milky Way. Neutron star-black hole mergers and fast-merging binary neutron star systems are among the leading alternative candidates. In this study, we combine gravitational-wave observations from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with data from short gamma-ray bursts, Galactic pulsars, and Galactic [Eu/Fe] vs [Fe/H] abundance observations to assess the contribution of these mergers to $r$-process enrichment in the Galactic disk. We find that neither neutron star-black hole mergers nor fast-merging binary neutron star populations can serve as the dominant additional channel without generating strong tension with existing observations and theoretical expectations. These results constrain the viable sources of Galactic $r$-process enrichment and underscore the necessity of non-merger production channels.

#### AllBRICQS: The Discovery of Luminous Quasars in the Northern Hemisphere

 - **Abstract**
 We present the second catalog of bright quasars from the All-sky BRIght, Complete Quasar Survey (AllBRICQS), focusing on spectroscopically observed quasars in the Northern Hemisphere with Galactic latitude $|b| > 10^\circ$. This catalog includes their spectral data, redshifts, and luminosities. AllBRICQS aims to identify the last remaining optically bright quasars using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and Gaia all-sky survey Data Release 3 (DR3). AllBRICQS searches for quasars that are brighter than $B_P = 16.5$ or $R_P = 16$ mag in Gaia DR3, based on simple selection criteria. Here, we report 62 new AllBRICQS quasars spanning various types, which include typical broad emission line quasars and the most luminous iron low-ionization broad absorption line quasars discovered to date. Spectroscopic observations were conducted using the Long-Slit Spectrograph on the 1.8-meter telescope at Bohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory, YFOSC on the 2.4-meter telescope at Lijiang Observatory, and BFOSC on the 2.16-meter telescope at Xinglong Observatory. We applied flux calibration using ZTF broadband photometry to correct for attenuation due to intermittent thin clouds during the observations. Redshifts were determined using inverse-variance weighted cross-correlation methods. Our targets span the bolometric luminosity range of $44.9<\log \left( L_{\rm bol} / {\rm erg~s^{-1}} \right)<48.0$ at redshifts between 0.09 and 2.48. These confirmed AllBRICQS quasars provide a valuable resource for future research into quasar evolution, black holes, their environments, and their host galaxies across multiple wavelengths.

#### Conformal Gravity as a Deformed Topological Field Theory

 - **Abstract**
 In the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation of general relativity, the spin connection and coframe variables are incorporated into a single Lie algebra-valued connection called the MacDowell-Mansouri connection, $\omega$. From the curvature form $F$ of $\omega$ and an auxiliary field, $B$, one may formulate general relativity as a deformed topological field theory by constructing an action functional whose variation yields a set of field equations that are equivalent to the Einstein equations on shell. In this article, we show that when the fundamental length scale of the MacDowell-Mansouri connection is regarded as a dynamical variable -- a cosmological scalar field -- the field equations obtained from the variation of the resulting action are equivalent to the conformal Einstein equations on shell. Through the lens of Cartan geometry, we then discuss a notable geometrical difference between general relativity and its conformally transformed counterpart. Specifically, for the latter, we show that points in spacetime are infinitesimally approximated by homogeneous spaces (restricted to a point) whose radii are parameterised by the value of the cosmological scalar field.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an exploration of the phenomenology of Horndeski gravity, focusing on regimes that produce weak gravity compared to General Relativity. This letter introduces a novel method to generate models of modified gravity theories that produce a specific observational behaviour while fulfilling stability criteria, without imposing a fixed parametrisation. We start from the inherently stable basis of linear Horndeski theory, implemented in the recently released Einstein-Boltzmann solver mochi_class. The time evolution of the basis functions is designed with Gaussian processes that directly include the stability and phenomenology criteria during the generation. Here, we focus on models with weak gravity that suppress the growth of Large-Scale Structure at late times. To achieve this behaviour, we mainly focus on the design of a dynamical effective Planck mass for theories with a vanishing fifth force. We find a broad range of weak-gravity islands in Horndeski theory space. We also include additional features, like a vanishing modification to gravity at $z=0$, and extend the exploration to islands of gravity with a non-zero fifth force. Finally, we show that replacing the $\Lambda$CDM expansion model by the DESI $w_0w_a$CDM best fit also produces stable islands of weak gravity.

#### Perturbative Hyperboloidal Extraction of Gravitational Waves in 3+1 Numerical Relativity

 - **Abstract**
 We present a framework to propagate to null infinity gravitational waves computed at timelike worldtubes in the interior of a 3+1 (Cauchy) numerical relativity simulations. In our method, numerical relativity data are used as the inner inflowing boundary of a perturbative time-domain Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli simulation in hyperboloidal coordinates that reaches null infinity. We showcase waveforms from (3+1)D simulations of gravitational collapse of rotating neutron stars, binary black holes mergers and scattering, and binary neutron star mergers and compare them to other extrapolation methods. Our perturbative hyperboloidal extraction provides a simple yet efficient procedure to compute gravitational waves with data quality comparable to the Cauchy characteristic extraction for several practical applications. Nonlinear effects in the wave propagation are not captured by our method, but the present work is a stepping stone towards more sophisticated hyperboloidal schemes for gravitational-wave extraction.

#### Generalized Perturbed Kepler Problem: Gravitational Wave Imprints from Eccentric Compact Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of astrophysical binaries may reveal departures from pure Keplerian orbits due to environmental influences, modifications to the underlying gravitational dynamics, or signatures of new physics. In this work, we develop a unified framework to systematically study such perturbations in the ambit of perturbed Kepler problem, and explore their impact on eccentric orbital dynamics and gravitational wave emission. Unlike traditional parametrized frameworks such as post-Newtonian and post-Einsteinian expansions, our approach offers a more source-specific modeling strategy, making it more natural to trace the physical origins of various model parameters. Starting from a general perturbed potential, we derive the modified orbit and compute the associated gravitational fluxes and phase evolution, assessing their observational relevance for both current and future detectors. This framework thus offers a general and physically transparent toolkit to probe such subtle effects in gravitational wave data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a data-driven method for holographic bulk reconstruction that works even when the spacetime is not asymptotically AdS. Given the data of boundary Green functions within a finite frequency window, we iteratively adjust a bulk metric with a finite radial cutoff until its holographic Green functions reproduce the boundary data. Based on the holographic Wilsonian renormalization group for the Klein-Gordon equation in an undetermined curve space, we construct a radial flow equation and transform it into a Neural ODE, which is an infinite-depth neural network for modeling continuous dynamics. Assuming the double-trace coupling $h$ in the Wilsonian action is real, we demonstrate that the Neural ODE can effectively learn the metrics with AdS, Lifshitz, and hyperscaling violated asymptotics. In particular, we apply the algorithm to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which slightly deviates from the conformal limit. In the hyperparameter space spanned by the rescaled temperature $\bar{T}$ and the radial cutoff $\epsilon$, we identify a critical curve along which the learned metric is close to AdS$_2$ black hole with finite cutoff. We derive an approximate analytical expression for this curve, from which an effective bulk dual of the SYK coupling $v$ is established. Our work provides a promising way for using machine learning to depict the novel bulk geometry dual to the non-conformal boundary systems in the real world.

#### Quantum Geometric Phases as a New Window on Gravitational Waves

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how low-frequency gravitational waves (LFGWs), originating from distant astrophysical or cosmological sources, can induce purely quantum geometric phases in mesoscopic optomechanical systems. These phases represent subtle imprints with no classical counterpart, going beyond standard dynamical or Berry-type contributions that admit Hannay-angle analogues. Such ultra-weak waves couple to the motion of a mechanical mirror and generate distinctive phase shifts in the system's quantum state that cannot arise in any classical description. To access this effect, we propose a Ramsey-type interferometric protocol in which the photon-number states of a quantized optical mode become entangled with the mirror's center-of-mass motion, enabling a direct readout of the LFGW-induced geometric phase. This framework establishes a distinctly quantum approach for probing low-frequency gravitational wave modes, offering an alternative to conventional detection strategies based on spacetime strain.
