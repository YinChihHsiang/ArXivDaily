 - **Abstract**
 The temporal dependence of the astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background (SGWB) in the hecto-hertz band brings a unique avenue to identify multi-messenger signals to these sources by using coincident detection in both GW and multi-band EM signals. We developed a new analysis pipeline, \textit{Multi-messenger Cross-Correlation} (MC$^2$) that can search for EM counterparts to the SGWB signal originating from both modeled and unmodeled sources by harnessing the nearly full-sky gamma-ray sky map. We provide an observation strategy that can be followed by current and future missions to discover EM counterparts to the weak GW signal hidden in the SGWB. We demonstrate the ability of this technique to drastically reduce the false alarm rates when involving EM multi-band analysis. This formalism aims towards advancing the multi-messenger observation frontier and improving our understanding of the population of bright SGWB sources present in the high-redshift universe and can also be applied to other messengers such as neutrinos in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effects of large scalar inhomogeneities during the kination epoch, a period in which the universe's dynamics are dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field, by fully evolving the Einstein equations using numerical relativity. By tracking the non-linear growth of scalar perturbations with both sub-horizon and super-horizon initial wavelengths, we are able to compare their evolution to perturbative results. Our key findings show that in the deep sub-horizon limit, the perturbative behaviour remains valid, whereas in the super-horizon regime, non-linear dynamics exhibit a much richer phenomenology. Finally, we discuss the possibility of primordial black hole formation from the collapse of such perturbations and assess whether this process could serve as a viable mechanism to reheat the universe in the post-inflationary era.

#### Dark energy constraints in light of theoretical priors

 - **Abstract**
 In order to derive model-independent observational bounds on dark energy/modified gravity theories, a typical approach is to constrain parametrised models intended to capture the space of dark energy theories. Here we investigate in detail the effect that the nature of these parametrisations can have, finding significant effects on the resulting cosmological dark energy constraints. In order to observationally distinguish well-motivated and physical parametrisations from unphysical ones, it is crucial to understand the theoretical priors that physical parametrisations place on the phenomenology of dark energy. To this end we discuss a range of theoretical priors that can be imposed on general dark energy parametrisations, and their effect on the constraints on the phenomenology of dynamical dark energy. More specifically, we investigate both the phenomenological $\{\mu,\Sigma\}$ parametrisation as well as effective field theory (EFT) inspired approaches to model dark energy interactions. We compare the constraints obtained in both approaches for different phenomenological and theory-informed time-dependences for the underlying functional degrees of freedom, discuss the effects of priors derived from gravitational wave physics, and investigate the interplay between constraints on parameters constraining only the background evolution vs. parameters controlling linear perturbations.

#### Horizon quantum geometries and decoherence

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18709

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18709

 - **Abstract**
 There is mounting theoretical evidence that black hole horizons induce decoherence on a quantum system, say a particle, put in a superposition of locations, with the decoherence functional, evaluated after closure of the superposition, increasing linearly with the time the superposition has been kept open. This phenomenon has been shown to owe its existence to soft modes, that is modes with very low frequencies, of the quantum fields -- sourced by the particle -- which pierce through the horizon, or also can be understood as coming from the interaction with the black hole described as a thermodynamic quantum system at Hawking's temperature. Here we investigate the effects of ensuing quantum aspects of the geometry itself of the horizon, in an effective perspective in which the quantum geometry of the horizon is captured by existence of a limit length or by horizon area quantisation. We show that the discreteness of the energy levels associated to the different geometric configurations might have strong impact on the results, in particular reducing the decoherence effects even to a negligible level in case of quanta of area $A_0 = \mathcal{O}(1) \, \, l_p^2$ or larger, with $l_p$ the Planck length.

#### Effects of matter with anisotropic pressure on the Fan-Wang regular black hole shadows

 - **Abstract**
 We here investigate the consequences of an exotic fluid, exhibiting negative radial and tangential pressures, \emph{de facto} violating the Zel'dovich limit, on a regular solution that easily generalizes the Schwarzschild black hole. More precisely, we focus on the regular Fan-Wang spacetime, computing how the black hole shadow images, surrounded by the quoted fluid, is modified through the presence of \emph{negative} equations of state for the two pressure components. Even though quite different from quintessence, we consider constant radial and tangential equations of state with the aim of emulating, but not reproducing, dark energy effects. Moreover, we explore the main properties of infalling spherical accretion flows and, accordingly, the influence of the equations of state on the horizons, photosphere, and impact parameter of the Fan-Wang black hole. Afterwards, we examine the luminosities of the shadow and the photon ring in two distinct spherically accretion flows, as well as the observed specific intensity of the shadow itself. Last but not least, we physically interpret the impact of negative pressures on our findings and discuss possible extensions to the isotropic case.

#### Radial oscillations of neutron stars in Starobinsky gravity and its Gauss-Bonnet extension

 - **Abstract**
 Starobinsky gravity, as one of the simplest and best-behaved higher-curvature gravity theories, has been extensively studied in the context of neutron stars over the past few decades. In this work, we investigate the adiabatic radial oscillation stability of neutron stars within the framework of Starobinsky gravity. We find that gravitational modifications can significantly impact stellar stability. Specifically, the higher-derivative nature of the theory causes the exterior spacetime to dynamically respond to fluid oscillations, in contrast to general relativity where Birkhoff's theorem ensures a static exterior. For stellar models with low central densities, the fundamental frequency becomes nearly independent of the central density when the coupling constant is large. For stellar models with high central densities, the transition from stability to instability still approximately occurs near the maximum-mass configuration, similar to the case in general relativity. Our main analysis is conducted in the Jordan frame of the scalar-tensor gravity equivalent to Starobinsky gravity, and we explicitly verify consistency with results obtained in the Einstein frame. We further extend our study to a class of Gauss-Bonnet extensions of Starobinsky gravity.

#### Relativistic scalar dark matter drag forces on a black hole binary

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter around black holes can induce drag forces through dynamical friction and accretion, potentially affecting the orbital evolution and gravitational wave emission of binary systems. While dynamical friction from scalar field dark matter has been studied in the relativistic regime for single black holes, the case of a binary black hole (BBH) has remained unexplored. As a first step, we present a series of two-dimensional general-relativistic simulations of BBH in a wind tunnel for an asymptotically homogeneous scalar field background. We extract the drag forces, torque, mass and charge accretion acting on the binary, and analyze their dependence on the binary separation, velocity and the scalar field parameters. We find that the binary's drag is not a simple superposition of two isolated black holes; the presence of a companion modifies the gravitational wake and yields significant nonlinearities. This additional force and torque can (in principle) modify the inspiral and induce a dephasing of the gravitational wave signal.

#### $F(ϕ)T$-Gravity and Inflationary Natural Model

 - **Abstract**
 By applying a particular kind of modified gravity, we study the inflation. Precisely, we extend our investigations beyond the Einstein's gravity to explore the Natural inflation model via the term $F(\phi)T$. We compute the inflation dynamics to derive the slow-roll parameters, i.e., the tensor-to-scalar ratio ``$r$'' and the scalar spectral index ``$n_s$''. This modified form of the gravity yields not only the predictions of the original models but also better-fitting with the Planck/BICEP/Keck data.

#### Dynamical theory for spherical black holes in modified gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a general algorithm to construct a Hamiltonian, such that its dynamical flow covariantly defines any given spherically symmetric and static metric. This Hamiltonian is defined as a linear combination of the standard (general relativistic) radial diffeomorphism constraint plus a Hamiltonian constraint that is appropriately deformed as compared to its corresponding form in general relativity though it does not include higher-derivative terms. Therefore, given a static model of spherical gravity, it is possible to obtain its Hamiltonian, and, thus, its canonical (second-order) equations of motion. A particularly relevant application of this construction is the study of regular black holes, where proposed geometries often lack an underlying dynamical theory. The present method provides such a theory. In particular, for a wide class of deformations of the Schwarzschild geometry, we explicitly obtain their corresponding Hamiltonian. This construction can be further used to covariantly couple matter. In this way, one can analyze the backreaction of matter fields on the geometry of interest, and, specifically, whether a particular black-hole model may emerge as the end state of a dynamical collapse.

#### Remnant properties of binary neutron star mergers undergoing prompt collapse

 - **Abstract**
 We study the properties of remnants formed in prompt-collapse binary neutron star mergers. We consider non-spinning binaries over a range of total masses and mass ratios across a set of 22 equations of state, totaling 107 numerical relativity simulations. We report the final mass and spin of the systems (including the accretion disk and ejecta) to be constrained in a narrow range, regardless of the binary configuration and matter effects. This sets them apart from binary black-hole merger remnants. We assess the detectability of the postmerger signal in a future 40 km Cosmic Explorer observatory and find that the signal-to-noise ratio in the postmerger of an optimally located and oriented binary at a distance of 100 Mpc can range from ${<}1$ to 8, depending on the binary configuration and equation of state, with a majority of them greater than 4 in the set of simulations that we consider. We also consider the distinguishability between prompt-collapse binary neutron star and binary black hole mergers with the same masses and spins. We find that Cosmic Explorer will be able to distinguish such systems primarily via the measurement of tidal effects in the late inspiral. Neutron star binaries with \emph{reduced tidal deformability} $\tilde\Lambda$ as small as ${\sim}3.5$ can be identified up to a distance of 100 Mpc, while neutron star binaries with $\tilde\Lambda\sim22$ can be identified to distances greater than 250 Mpc. This is larger than the distance up to which the postmerger will be visible. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of our findings for the equation of state of neutron stars from the gravitational-wave event GW230529.

#### Virtual thermodynamic potential and black hole criticality

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new way to relate the black hole thermodynamics and geometry by generalizing the Euclidean formalism to include "virtual geometries", which do not necessarily satisfy Einstein equations. This provides a physically well motivated route to study black hole criticality and obtain the Landau Ginzburg potential. We compute the "virtual thermodynamic potential" and show that it satisfies a modified quantum statistical relation that is compatible with the first law of black hole thermodynamics supplemented with an extra term, interpreted as virtual work in previous literature. The novelty is that, within our formalism, we can explicitly compute this term as the first derivative of the virtual thermodynamic potential with respect to the horizon radius that is considered as the order parameter. Imposing the physical condition that the first derivative vanishes is at the basis of the matching between the first law of black hole thermodynamics and (one of the) Einstein equations evaluated at the horizon. Interestingly, imposing the physical conditions that the second and third derivatives vanish, we can concretely study the criticality and existence of swallow tails. As a specific example, we apply this formalism to an exact four dimensional asymptotically flat hairy black hole, namely the generalized Kaluza Klein (KK) black hole when the dilaton potential is included, and show that it is thermodynamically stable and has a non-trivial critical behaviour corresponding to an inverted swallowtail.
