 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) have long been recognized as key probes of early black hole growth and galaxy evolution. However, modeling this population remains difficult due to the wide range of luminosities and black hole masses involved, and the high computational costs of capturing the hydrodynamic response of gas and evolving radiation fields on-the-fly. In this study, we present a new suite of simulations based on the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation framework, enhanced with on-the-fly radiative transfer, to examine AGN at high redshift (z > 5) in a protocluster environment extracted from the MillenniumTNG simulation. We focus on the co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies, as well as the radiative impact on surrounding intergalactic gas. The model predicts that black holes form in overdense regions and lie below the local black hole-stellar mass relation, with stellar mass assembly preceding significant black hole accretion. Ionizing photons are primarily produced by stars, which shape the morphology of ionized regions and drive reionization. Given the restrictive black hole growth in the original IllustrisTNG model, we reduce the radiative efficiency from 0.2 to 0.1, resulting in higher accretion rates for massive black holes, more bursty growth, and earlier AGN-driven quenching. However, the resulting AGN remain significantly fainter than observed high-redshift quasars. As such, to incorporate this missing population, we introduce a quasar boosted model, in which we artificially boost the AGN luminosity. This results in strong effects on the surrounding gas, most notably a proximity effect, and large contributions to He ionization.

 - **Abstract**
 The Earth's atmospheric turbulence degrades the precision of ground-based astrometry. Here we discuss these limitations and propose that, with proper treatment of systematics and by leveraging the many epochs available from the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), seeing-limited observations can reach sub-milliarcsecond precision. Such observations may be instrumental for the detection of Galactic black holes via microlensing. We present our methodology and pipeline for precise astrometric measurements using seeing-limited observations. The method is a variant of Gaia's Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) that include several detrending steps. Tests on 6,500 images of the same field, obtained by KMTNet with typical seeing condition of 1 arcsecond and pixel scale of 0.4 arcsecond, suggest that we can achieve, at the bright end (mag <17), relative proper motion precision of 0.1-0.2 mas/yr, over a baseline of approximately five years, using data from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) site. The precision is estimated using bootstrap simulations and further validated by comparing results from two independent KMTNet telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical plasmas in relativistic spacetimes, such as black hole accretion flows, are often weakly collisional and require kinetic modeling to capture non-local transport and particle acceleration. However, the extreme scale separation between microscopic and macroscopic processes limits the feasibility of fully kinetic simulations. A covariant guiding center formalism has recently been derived to address this challenge in curved spacetimes. We present a new hybrid numerical algorithm based on this formalism, which evolves the trajectories of charged particles over macroscopic timescales in GRMHD backgrounds. To address numerical instabilities in the equations of motion, we develop a semi-implicit integrator that ensures stable evolution in strong-field environments. We apply our method to GRMHD simulations of black hole accretion flows, demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency across a range of physical conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of gravitational waves (GW) by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network has opened up a new era in astrophysics. The identification of the electromagnetic counterparts of GW sources is crucial for multi-messenger astronomy, one way of which is to use galaxy catalogues to guide optical follow-up observations. In this paper, we test the utility of galaxy-targeted approach with mass prioritised galaxy ranking for the ongoing LIGO O4 run. We have used the simulated results for the expected LIGO O4 events and the NED-LVS galaxy catalogue and based our study for small field of view telescopes, specifically the GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). With the increase in sensitivity of LIGO/Virgo in the ongoing observing run O4, the expected number of total detections have gone up but most of these are also now poorly localised. We show that a larger volume covered in the same field-of-view (FoV) on the sky results in a large increase in the total number of galaxies in each FoV. A significant top-heaviness is observed in the mass-ranked list of galaxies, which still number to a few thousand in most cases. At larger distances, such high numbers of deep follow-up observations are infeasible in most cases rendering galaxy catalogues useful in limited cases, but these are still useful at lower distances where LVK detectors are currently sensitive and where galaxy completeness is higher. We also explore the effect of mass-filling to account for galaxy catalogue incompleteness at large distances. If mass-filled probabilities are considered as the metric for ranking and coverage, we find that the conventional 2D probability search performs better than a 3D galaxy catalogue (without mass-filling) based search at distances larger than 300 Mpc (upto which NED-LVS is ~70% complete), and using 3D mass times probability in each tile performs better for nearby events.
#### The evolution of a supermassive binary black hole in an non-spherical nuclear star cluster

 - **Abstract**
 (abridged) We consider a secular orbital evolution of a supermassive binary black hole (SBBH) with unequal masses $M_p$ and $M_s < M_p$ in a central part of a non-spherical nuclear star cluster (NSC). When the mass of NSC inside the orbit is smaller than $M_{s}$ dynamical friction becomes inefficient. The subsequent orbital evolution of SBBH is largely governed by perturbing tidal potential of NSC arising from its non-sphericity. When the perturbing potential is mainly determined by quadrupole harmonics with azimuthal number $|m|=2$ the secular dynamics of the SBBH does not conserve any components of the angular momentum and can lead to the formation of highly eccentric orbits. Such orbits can experience an efficient circularization due to emission of gravitational waves (GW). In this Paper we consider this situation in some detail. We study analytically and numerically the orbital evolution taking into account the important effect of Einstein apsidal precession and estimate the largest possible value of $e$, which can be obtained. We then estimate a possibility of fast orbital circularization through emission of gravitation waves on a highly eccentric orbit, with circularization timescale of the order of the orbital period. We find that our mechanism could result in such events on a time scale of the order of or smaller than a few Gyr. It is stressed that for particular values of the model parameters such events may sometimes be distinguished from the ones expected in more standard scenarios, since in our case the eccentricity may remain substantial all the way down to the final merger. It is also noted that our results can be applied to other astrophysical settings, e.g. to study the orbital evolution of a binary star or a proto planetary system inside a massive deformed gas cloud.

 - **Abstract**
 Follow-up of gravitational-wave events by wide-field surveys is a crucial tool for the discovery of electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave sources, such as kilonovae. Machine learning tools can play an important role in aiding search efforts. We have developed a public tool to predict kilonova light curves using simulated low-latency alert data from the International Gravitational Wave Network during observing runs 4 (O4) and 5 (O5). It uses a bidirectional long-short-term memory (LSTM) model to forecast kilonova light curves from binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole mergers in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time filters. The model achieves a test mean squared error (MSE) of 0.19 for ZTF filters and 0.22 for Rubin filters, calculated by averaging the squared error over all time steps, filters, and light curves in the test set. We verify the performance of the model against merger events followed-up by the ZTF partnership during O4a and O4b. We also analyze the effect of incorporating skymaps and constraints on physical features such as ejecta mass through a hybrid convolutional neural network and LSTM model. Using ejecta mass, the performance of the model improves to an MSE of 0.1. However, using full skymap information results in slightly lower model performance. Our models are publicly available and can help to add important information to help plan follow-up of candidate events discovered by current and next-generation public surveys.
#### The origin of the most recently ejected OB runaway star from the R136 cluster

 - **Abstract**
 The $\sim 60\,000$ solar-mass (\MSun) star-cluster R136 (NGC~2070) in the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud is the host of at least 55 massive stars ($M \apgt 10$\,\MSun) which move away from the cluster at projected velocities $\gteq 27.5$\,km/s \cite{2024Natur.634..809S}. The origin of the high velocities of such runaway stars have been debated since the 1960s, resulting either from dynamical ejections \citep{1961BAN....15..265B,1961BAN....15..291B} or from supernova explosions \citep{1983ApJ...267..322H}. Due to the Gaia satellite's outstanding precision, we can now retrace the most recently ejected binary star, Mel 34, back to the center of R136 and reconstruct the events that 52\,000 years ago let to its removal from R136, i.e., we establish its dynamical interaction and ejection history. We find that this ejection requires the participation of 5 stars in a strong interaction between a triple composed of the tight massive binary Mel~39 orbited by the star VFTS~590, and the binary star Mel~34. The participation of 5 stars is unexpected because runaway stars were not expected to result from triple interactions \cite{2011Sci...334.1380F}. The deterministic nature of the Newtonian dynamics in the scattering enables us to reconstruct the encounter that ejected Mel~34. We then predict that Mel~39 is a binary star with an 80\,\Msun\, companion star that orbits within $\sim 1^\circ$ in the same plane as Mel~34, and escapes the cluster with a velocity of $\sim 64$\,km/s. The five stars will undergo supernova explosions in the coming 5\,Myr at a distance of $\sim 180$\,pc to $\sim 332$\,pc from their birth location (R\,136). The resulting black hole binaries, however, are not expected to merge within a Hubble time.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) have provided a new lens through which to view the universe beyond traditional electromagnetic methods. The upcoming space-based gravitational wave mission, Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), will give us the first glimpse of the sky in mHz gravitational waves, a waveband that contains a rich variety of sources including massive binary black hole (MBBH) mergers. In this work, we investigate the spatial distribution of MBBH mergers versus the galaxy distribution to determine how well LISA could be used as a unique and independent probe of large-scale structure. We compare the two-point correlation function (2pt CF) of MBBH mergers to that of galaxies within the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation IllustrisTNG. Our results show that MBBH mergers exhibit stronger clustering than galaxies at scales less than 10 Mpc $h^{-1}$, particularly at higher redshifts, and that the bias is relatively constant as a function of separation. These findings imply that the spatial distribution of MBBH mergers detectable by LISA could inform the observed galaxy distribution. In addition, this implies that searches for a cosmological background in LISA data could use a prior derived from large-scale structure observations to subtract the MBBH foreground.
#### Quasi-Periodic Oscillations due to radiative feedback mechanism between the disc and corona

 - **Abstract**
 Compact object systems exhibit Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) as revealed by peaked features in their power density spectra. It has been known that stochastic variations in the accretion disc will propagate to the corona after a time delay and that the hard X-rays from the corona impinge back on the disc, giving reflection spectral features. Here, we show that the combination of these two effects makes a simple radiative feedback system between the corona and the disc, which naturally produces the observed QPOs whose primary frequency corresponds to the inverse of the time delay. The analytical form of the expected power spectra can be statistically compared with the observed ones. Hence, for the first time, a physical model is used to describe and fit the AstroSat observed power spectra of the black hole systems MAXI J1535-571 and GRS 1915+105, including the QPO, its harmonics, as well as the broadband components.

 - **Abstract**
 The elastic properties of the neutron star crust are thought to play a crucial role in various phenomena of neutron stars (glitches, oscillations, gravitational wave emission) and should be described quantitatively to model these phenomena. The fundamental problem of this description is associated with the polycrystalline nature of the crust: similar to terrestrial materials, the elastic moduli, strictly speaking, depend on the shape and orientation of crystallites, but for the crust, they are unknown. As a result, some assumptions are generally required to predict the elastic properties or constrain their possible range. In this paper, we follow the commonly believed assumption that the crust is (locally) isotropic, which allows us to describe elastic properties by two (effective) parameters: bulk and shear moduli. The bulk modulus is well determined by the Voigt-Reuss bounds, and we constrain the shear modulus by applying, for the first time in astrophysics of compact stars, the variational Hashin-Shtrikman approach, based on the additional assumption that there are no correlations in the orientation of crystallites. We analyse the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds for the one-component crust taking into account the electron screening and the motion of the nuclei, and for two-component static crystals. In particular, we demonstrate that within applied assumptions the effective shear modulus should be lower than the Voigt estimate, typically applied in the astrophysical literature.
#### All-sky search for short gravitational-wave bursts in the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run

 - **Abstract**
 We present a search for short-duration gravitational-wave transients in data from the first eight months of Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observing run, denoted O4a. We use four analyses which are sensitive to a wide range of potential signals lasting up to a few seconds in the 16-4096 Hz band. Excluding binary black hole merger candidates that were already identified by low-latency analyses, we find no statistically significant evidence for other gravitational-wave transients. We measure the sensitivity of the search for representative signals, including sine-Gaussians, Gaussian pulses, and white-noise bursts with different frequencies and durations, adopting a false alarm rate of 1 per 100 years as detection threshold. Depending on signal type, we find improvements over previous searches by factors of 2 to 10 in terms of sensitivity to strain amplitude and of 90% confidence upper limit on the rate density of sources. We also evaluate a variety of core-collapse supernova models and find that, for some models, the search could have detected gravitational waves from stellar core-collapse throughout the Milky Way. Finally, we consider neutron star f-modes associated with pulsar glitches and find that, assuming a source similar to the Vela Pulsar, the search could have detected a gravitational-wave signal from a glitch with fractional frequency change as small as $\sim 2$ to $6 \times 10^{-5}$ depending on the neutron star mass.
#### Optical images of massive boson stars with nonlinear electrodynamics

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the optical imaging characteristics of massive boson stars based on a model with Einstein's nonlinear electrodynamics. Under asymptotically flat boundary conditions, the field equations are solved numerically to obtain the spacetime metric of the massive boson stars. Employing the ray-tracing method, we analyze the optical images of the massive boson stars under two illumination conditions: a celestial light source and a thin accretion disk. The research reveals that the configurations and optical images of the massive boson stars can be tuned via the initial parameter $\phi_0$ and the coupling constant $\Lambda$. The absence of the event horizon in the massive boson stars results in distinct optical image characteristics compared to those of black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a short review of the analytical aspects of recent progress in the study of black hole spectral instability and its potential observational consequences. This topic, inspired by earlier foundational works, has attracted considerable attention in the recent literature. It has been demonstrated that both the low-lying modes and high overtones of black hole quasinormal spectra can be substantially influenced by ultraviolet metric perturbations. The temporal evolution of gravitational wave signals is primarily governed by the first few low-lying quasinormal modes. In contrast, the asymptotic behavior of high overtones is closely associated with the phenomenon of black hole echoes. We review relevant studies on spectral instability in both regimes, highlighting their potential to produce substantial observational signatures in gravitational wave data. Additionally, recent proposals of Regge poles and reflectionless modes as alternative stable observables for probing black hole spacetimes are summarized.

 - **Abstract**
 Addressing the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe, known as the ``dark energy problem'', remains a central challenge in cosmology. While the cosmological constant is the standard explanation, alternative models such as quintessence, phantom fluids, and Chaplygin gas have been proposed. This work investigates the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model, which is characterized by a polytropic equation of state. We explore this model within the framework of an anisotropic fluid, by means of a metric that reduces to the standard form of the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime at cosmological scales. To assess the model's viability, we derive analytical expressions for the scale factor, the Hubble parameter, and the deceleration parameter. Finally, the model is tested against observational data to constrain its parameters and evaluate its consistency.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11803

 - **Abstract**
 In four-dimensional scalar-tensor theories derived via dimensional regularization with a conformal rescaling of the metric, we study the stability of planar black holes (BHs) whose horizons are described by two-dimensional compact Einstein spaces with vanishing curvature. By taking an infinite sum of Lovelock curvature invariants, it is possible to construct BH solutions whose metric components remain nonsingular at $r=0$, with a scalar-field derivative given by $\phi'(r)=1/r$, where $r$ is the radial coordinate. We show that such BH solutions suffer from a strong coupling problem, where the kinetic term of the even-parity scalar-field perturbation associated with the timelike coordinate vanishes everywhere. Moreover, we find that these BHs are subject to both ghost and Laplacian instabilities for odd-parity perturbations near $r=0$. Consequently, the presence of these pathological features rules out regular planar BHs with the scalar-field profile $\phi'(r)=1/r$ as physically viable and stable configurations.
#### Extracting energy from plunging region of a Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole by magnetic reconnection

 - **Abstract**
 We have studied the energy extraction from a Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole via magnetic reconnections occurring in the plunging region. Our results show that the gravitomagnetic charge suppresses the energy extraction process through magnetic reconnection and reduces the corresponding extraction efficiency, which is opposite to those of the black hole spin and the magnetization parameter. Finally, we treat the energy extraction process through magnetic reconnection as a mechanism to revisit the problem on the observed jet power and radiative efficiency of GRS 1915+105. Our results show that the allowed black hole parameter region originating from the jet power has an intersection with the region from the radiative efficiency. This means that with this mechanism related to magnetic reconnection the Kerr-Taub-NUT metric can simultaneously explain the observed jet power and radiative efficiency for GRS 1915+105, which is not explained by other mechanisms in previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We tested the thermodynamic properties of charged BTZ-type black holes (BHs) in the framework of Bopp Podolsky electrodynamics, a higher derivative extension of Maxwells theory that preserves gauge invariance while introducing a massive photon mode. Using a perturbative approach, we derive first and second order corrections to the metric and electric field, revealing how the Bopp Podolsky parameter b modifies the geometry and horizon structure. Unlike in four dimensional illustrations, where such corrections can lead to wormhole solutions, the (2+1)dimensional case retains a black hole interpretation, albeit with curvature dependent deformations that vanish asymptotically. We compute the Hawking temperature via the Hamilton Jacobi tunneling method, demonstrating its dependence on both the cosmological constant and the Bopp Podolsky coupling. Our results indicate that while energy conditions are marginally violated for certain parameter regimes, the BHs thermodynamic behavior remains well-defined, with temperature corrections emerging from the interplay between higher derivative electrodynamics and the lower dimensional gravitational background.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic aspects of quadratic gravity in a $D$-dimensional Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. First, we derive the field equations and the effective energy-momentum tensor for quadratic gravity. Then, using these equations, we obtain the generalized Misner-Sharp energy within the framework of this model. We consider the thermodynamic behavior of the apparent horizon and derive the equations of state related to the pressure, temperature, and radius of the apparent horizon. Using the thermodynamic pressure, we obtain the critical points corresponding to phase transitions. We determine the critical temperature and critical radius in terms of model parameters, including the quadratic coupling and the cosmological constant. We also examine key thermodynamic quantities, such as Wald entropy, specific heat at constant pressure, enthalpy, Gibbs free energy. By examining the behavior of these quantities, we can gain insight into the thermodynamic stability of the quadratic gravity model. In particular, we find that quadratic terms change the stability conditions and can lead to new thermodynamic behaviors compared to general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the public release of the low-frequency atlas of continuous gravitational waves, covering signals with frequencies from 20 Hz to 200 Hz and frequency derivatives from -5e-11 to 5e-11 Hz/s. Compared to the previous atlas releases, this version demonstrates significant improvements in sensitivity and sky resolution. In the most sensitive region even the worst-case upper limits on gravitational wave strain are below 1e-25. The atlas data is being released ahead of the completion of the full follow-up analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an all-sky search for long-duration gravitational waves (GWs) from the first part of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA fourth observing run (O4), called O4a and comprising data taken between 24 May 2023 and 16 January 2024. The GW signals targeted by this search are the so-called "long-duration" (> 1 s) transients expected from a variety of astrophysical processes, including non-axisymmetric deformations in magnetars or eccentric binary coalescences. We make minimal assumptions on the emitted GW waveforms in terms of morphologies and durations. Overall, our search targets signals with durations ~1-1000 s and frequency content in the range 16-2048 Hz. In the absence of significant detections, we report the sensitivity limits of our search in terms of root-sum-square signal amplitude (hrss) of reference waveforms. These limits improve upon the results from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O3) by about 30% on average. Moreover, this analysis demonstrates substantial progress in our ability to search for long-duration GW signals owing to enhancements in pipeline detection efficiencies. As detector sensitivities continue to advance and observational runs grow longer, unmodeled long-duration searches will increasingly be able to explore a range of compelling astrophysical scenarios involving neutron stars and black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 The ringdown signal following a BH merger can be modeled as a superposition of BH QNMs, offering a clean setup for testing gravitational theories. In particular, detecting multiple QNMs enables consistency checks of their frequencies and damping times, serving as a test of General Relativity -- a technique known as black hole spectroscopy. However, incorporating additional QNMs introduces challenges such as increased parameter correlations and higher computational costs in data analysis. To address this, we propose an efficient Bayesian analysis method that applies the Gram-Schmidt algorithm to the QNMs. This reduces the correlation between the modes and enables analytic marginalization over the mode amplitudes. We validate our approach using damped sinusoids and numerical waveforms from the SXS catalog.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the Hawking temperature of a charged Ads black hole (spherically symmetric) on the basis of a completely topological method introduced by Robson, Villari, and Biancalana (RVB). This topological method can give the exact Hawking temperature of the charged Ads black hole. We have also derived the Hawking temperature of a charged Ads black hole considering massive gravity. Due to the presence of mass term in the metric function of the charged Ads black hole in massive gravity, the effect of mass term can't be neglected when calculating the Hawking temperature. In massive gravity, the accurate Hawking temperature can be obtained by including an integral constant term, which can be derived from the standard definition.
