 - **Abstract**
 The central engines of Little Red Dots (LRDs) may be ``black hole stars" (BH*s), early stages of black hole growth characterized by dense gas envelopes. So far, the most direct evidence for BH*s comes from a handful of sources where the host galaxy is completely outshone as suggested by their remarkably steep Balmer breaks. Here we present a novel scheme to disentangle BH*s from their host galaxies assuming that the [OIII]5008Å line arises exclusively from the host. Using a sample of 98 LRDs ($z$~$2-9$) with high quality NIRSpec/PRISM spectra, we demonstrate that the host-subtracted median stack displays a Balmer break $>2\times$ stronger than massive quiescent galaxies, with the rest-optical continuum resembling a blackbody-like SED ($T_{\rm{eff}}$~$4050$ K, $\log(L_{\rm{bol}})$~$43.9$ erg s$^{-1}$, $R_{\rm{eff}}$~$1300$ au). We measure a steep Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta>10$) and numerous density-sensitive features (e.g., FeII, HeI, OI). These are hallmark signatures of dense gas envelopes, providing population-level evidence that BH*s indeed power LRDs. In the median LRD, BH*s account for $\sim20\%$ of the UV emission, $\sim50\%$ at the Balmer break, and $\sim90\%$ at wavelengths longer than H$\alpha$ with the remainder arising from the host. BH*s preferentially reside in low-mass galaxies ($M_{\rm{\star}}$~$10^{8}\,{\rm M}_{\rm{\odot}}$) undergoing recent starbursts, as evidenced by extreme emission line EWs (e.g., [OIII]5008Å~$1100$Å, CIII]~$12$Å), thereby favoring BH* origins linked to star-formation. We show V-shaped LRD selections are biased to high BH*/host fractions ($\gtrsim60\%$ at 5500Å) -- less dominant BH*s may be powering JWST's blue broad-line AGN. We find BH*s are so commonplace and transient (duty cycle $\sim1\%$, lifetime $\sim10$ Myrs) that every massive black hole may have once shone as a BH*.

 - **Abstract**
 A significant fraction of galaxy clusters show central cooling times of less than 1 Gyr and associated central cluster entropies below $30\,\mathrm{keV}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$. We provide a straight forward explanation for these low central entropies in cool core systems and how this is related to accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Assuming a time-averaged equilibrium between active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet heating of the radiatively cooling intracluster medium (ICM) as well as Bondi accretion, we derive an equilibrium entropy that scales with the SMBH and cluster mass as $K\propto M_\bullet^{4/3}M_{500\mathrm{c}}^{-1}$. At fixed cluster mass, overly massive SMBHs would raise the central entropy above the cool core threshold, thus implying a novel way of limiting SMBH masses in cool core clusters. We find a limiting mass of $1.4\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ in a cool core cluster of mass $10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We carry out three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of an idealized Perseus-like cluster with AGN jets and find that they reproduce the predictions of our analytic model, once corrections for elevated jet entropies are applied in calculating X-ray emissivity-weighted cluster entropies. Our findings have significant implications for modelling galaxy clusters in cosmological simulations: a combination of overmassive SMBHs and high heating efficiencies preclude the formation of cool core clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we present the results of our search through the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) for extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) - a rare classification of galaxies displaying strong, high-ionization iron coronal emission lines within their spectra. With the requirement of a strong X-ray continuum to generate the coronal emission, ECLEs have been linked to both active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs). We focus our search on identifying TDE-linked ECLEs. We identify three such objects within the EDR sample, highlighting DESI's effectiveness for discovering new nuclear transients, and determine a galaxy-normalized TDE-linked ECLE rate of $R_\mathrm{G}=5~^{+5}_{-3}\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{galaxy}^{-1}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at a median redshift of z = 0.2 - broadly consistent with previous works. Additionally, we also identify more than 200 AGNs displaying coronal emission lines, which serve as the primary astrophysical contaminants in searches for TDE-related events. We also include an outline of the custom python code developed for this search.

#### Proposal to Search for the CP Violating Electromagnetic Vacuum Angle at the Event Horizon Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the possibility that evidence for a non-zero value of the CP violating $ \frac{e^2 }{32\pi^2}\theta_{EM} \int d^4 x {\vec E}\cdot {\vec B}$ coupling might be extracted from Event Horizon Telescope observations of the black holes SgA* and M87*. The Fischler-Kundu\cite{FK} effect predicts a universal Hall current in the relaxation of charge falling onto the black hole horizon. We argue that this leads to a non-zero value of a certain CP-violating observable ${\cal C}$, defined below. The effect can be masked by parity violating plasma currents. In particular, evidence for polarization flips \cite{flip} in the signals from M87* indicate strong plasma effects in the data. We suggest that time averaging the data over periods including the flip might leave over a residual that would be an indicator of the FK signal. In addition, similarities in the polarization patterns between the two very different black holes, and a part of the signal that is uniform in frequency, might enable us to distinguish the universal topological signal from source and frequency dependent plasma effects. Current data does not appear to be sufficient to perform such a test.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the hypothesis that the evolution of the Universe can be described by a single dark fluid whose effective equation of state (EoS), $\omega_{\rm{eff}}$, is a linear combination of a logarithmic term and a power law term, both involving the Lambert $W$ function. This particular form of EoS was first proposed by S. Saha and K. Bamba in 2019 and has two parameters, $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, which must be determined from observations. To this end, we place limits on these parameters by combining recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data -- including measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) -- with Type Ia supernova observations from the Pantheon+ compilation, along with direct determinations of the Hubble parameter. From this combined analysis, we obtain a best-fit value for the Hubble parameter, $H_0 = 67.4 \pm 1.2~\text{km\,s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, while current measurements of the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch yield $r_d = 146\pm 2.5$~Mpc. Furthermore, we study the evolution of the deceleration parameter, the effective EoS, and the jerk parameter, and support our findings using the $Om(z)$ diagnostic. The model exhibits noticeable deviations from the predictions of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. Despite these differences, our results indicate that the model provides a coherent description of late-time cosmic evolution and the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe. Finally, we assess the observational viability of the model using information criteria, particularly the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and compare these results with those obtained for the $\Lambda$CDM model, which serves as our reference.

#### Realizing the phantom-divide crossing with vector and scalar fields

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21274

 - **Abstract**
 In generalized Proca theories, characterized by a vector field with broken $U(1)$ gauge invariance, late-time cosmic acceleration can be realized with a dark energy equation of state in the regime $w_{\rm DE} < -1$. In such scenarios, however, a phantom-divide crossing, as recently suggested by DESI observations, is not achieved without encountering theoretical inconsistencies. We incorporate a canonical scalar field with a potential, in addition to the vector field, and show that the phantom-divide crossing from $w_{\rm DE} < -1$ to $w_{\rm DE} > -1$ can occur at low redshifts. We propose a minimal model that admits such a transition and identify the region of parameter space in which all dynamical degrees of freedom in the scalar, vector, and tensor sectors are free from ghost and Laplacian instabilities. We further investigate the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations by applying the quasi-static approximation to modes well inside the Hubble radius. The dimensionless quantities $\mu$ and $\Sigma$, which characterize the growth of matter perturbations and the bending of light rays, respectively, depend on the sound speed $c_\psi$ of the longitudinal scalar perturbation associated with the vector field. Since $c_\psi$ is influenced by the transverse vector mode, the model exhibits sufficient flexibility to yield values of $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ close to 1. Consequently, unlike theories such as scalar Galileons, the present model can be consistent with observations of redshift-space distortions and integrated Sachs-Wolfe-galaxy cross-correlations.

#### A redshift survey of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 2199 : No upturn of the faint-end slope of galaxy luminosity function

 - **Abstract**
 We determine the galaxy luminosity function of cluster galaxies in the nearby galaxy cluster Abell 2199 (A2199), focusing on the faint-end slope down to $M_r \sim -14.5$. To achieve this, we augment the existing dataset by adding redshift data from our deep MMT/Hectospec survey and from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), significantly improving the spectroscopic completeness down to $r_{\mathrm{petro},0} = 20.8$ within the central $30^\prime$ region. The resulting luminosity function is well described by a Schechter function with a characteristic magnitude $M^* = -21.30 \pm 0.27$ and a faint-end slope $\alpha = -1.23 \pm 0.05$. This faint-end slope is consistent with those measured in the nearby Coma and Virgo clusters and in a cluster from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, and is slightly shallower than that of field galaxies. These findings indicate that the previously claimed steep faint-end upturn (with $\alpha \sim -2$) in nearby galaxy clusters is not supported. Instead, they indicate that environmental processes in dense cluster cores does not seem to trigger the formation or survival of low-mass galaxies, thereby preventing a steep faint-end upturn in the luminosity function.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the cosmological analysis of the one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ flux power spectrum from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We capture the dependence of the signal on cosmology and intergalactic medium physics using an emulator trained on a cosmological suite of hydrodynamical simulations, and we correct its predictions for the impact of astrophysical contaminants and systematics, many of these not considered in previous analyses. We employ this framework to constrain the amplitude and logarithmic slope of the linear matter power spectrum at $k_\star=0.009\,\mathrm{km^{-1}s}$ and redshift $z=3$, obtaining $\Delta^2_\star=0.379\pm0.032$ and $n_\star=-2.309\pm0.019$. The robustness of these constraints is validated through the analysis of mocks and a large number of alternative data analysis variations, with cosmological parameters kept blinded throughout the validation process. We then combine our results with constraints from DESI BAO and temperature, polarization, and lensing measurements from Planck, ACT, and SPT-3G to set constraints on $\Lambda$CDM extensions. While our measurements do not significantly tighten the limits on the sum of neutrino masses from the combination of these probes, they sharpen the constraints on the effective number of relativistic species, $N_\mathrm{eff}=3.02\pm0.10$, the running of the spectral index, $\alpha_\mathrm{s}=0.0014\pm0.0041$, and the running of the running, $\beta_\mathrm{s}=-0.0006\pm0.0048$, by a factor of 1.18, 1.27, and 1.90, respectively. We conclude by outlining the improvements needed to fully reach the level of confidence implied by these uncertainties.

#### Compton hump reverberation lag in the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy IC 4329A with NuSTAR

 - **Abstract**
 Recent reverberation delay measurements have moved beyond the 10 keV X-ray range, providing evidence for the Compton hump (a.k.a. reflection hump) in the lag spectra. We report the relativistic reverberation of the reflection hump in the bright Seyfert\,1 galaxy IC\,4329A based on a long {\it NuSTAR} observation. We find a delayed response of the 20--30 keV X-ray band, with a lag time of $\sim1825$ s at frequencies $0.5-1.5 \times 10^{-4}$ Hz. The lag amplitude drops to $\sim195$ s as the frequencies increase to $(1.5-10)\times10^{-4}$ Hz. Including IC\,4329A, so far five sources have been explored for reflection hump reverberation. We perform reverberation modelling of the 3--50 keV lag-energy spectra using the general relativistic transfer function code, which provides independent timing-based measurements of the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}=1.37_{-0.36}^{+0.33}\times10^8~M_{\odot}$ and the coronal height $h=2.45_{-2.36}^{+1.92}~R_{\rm g}$ (with uncertainties at 90\% confidence). Within the uncertainties, the measured mass is found to be consistent with the previous finding. Furthermore, we undertake reflection spectroscopy to account for the hump feature and the associated relativistic effect using the time-averaged flux spectrum. Further sampling of the {\it NuSTAR} data (with a bin width of 0.2/0.4 keV below and above 10 keV) that reshapes the spectral resolution allows us to constrain the coronal temperature at $50.26_{-4.03}^{+5.58}$ keV -- consistent with the previous result from the combined {\it Suzaku} and {\it NuSTAR} data.

#### Little Red Dots and Supermassive Black Hole Seed Formation in Ultralight Dark Matter Halos

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21676

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds form in the early Universe at the centers of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) halos. Focusing on the ULDM Jeans scale, we identify the critical conditions under which high-redshift baryonic gas, strongly confined by central solitonic cores of the halos, undergoes direct and monolithic collapse. The solitonic potential naturally drives rapid inflow and shock heating, allowing the gas to exceed the critical atomic-cooling and fragmentation-suppression threshold of $\sim 3 \times 10^4 {\rm K}$ without invoking an external UV background. We derive semi-analytic relations for the halo mass, soliton mass, baryonic core radius, and thermodynamic state of the gas, including the effects of baryonic contraction. These relations simultaneously determine the minimum and maximum SMBH seed masses as functions of redshift. In this framework, pristine gas clouds that satisfy the temperature threshold collapse without fragmentation, forming SMBH seeds with characteristic masses of order $\sim 10^5M_\odot$, while systems below the threshold are expected to form compact star clusters instead. Our model also implies an upper limit on the attainable SMBH mass, predicting a maximum mass scale of order $\sim10^{10}M_\odot$, consistent with the most massive quasars observed to date. The ULDM particle mass required to reproduce the inferred seed mass scale, $m \simeq 10^{-22}{\rm eV}$, coincides with the value favored by galactic-scale observations, providing a unified explanation for the characteristic masses of both galactic cores and early SMBH seeds. Our model predicts efficient SMBH seed formation at redshifts $z \gtrsim 10$ and offers a natural interpretation of recently observed little red dots as SMBHs embedded in compact, hot, ionized gas clouds.

#### AGN Variability with Rubin Observatory in the 2030s

 - **Abstract**
 AGN variability offers a direct probe of accretion physics, disk structure, and black hole growth, but progress has been limited by sample size, cadence heterogeneity, and photometric systematics. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will deliver multi-band light curves for millions of AGN, enabling variability studies at a true population scale. We synthesize recent results from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which demonstrate that optical variability amplitudes and timescales are primarily regulated by accretion state, with secondary dependence on black hole mass and redshift, and establish the feasibility of survey-driven continuum reverberation mapping. ZTF measurements reveal optical continuum-emitting region sizes that often exceed standard thin disk predictions, implicating diffuse continuum emission from the broad line region as a significant contributor to observed inter-band lags. We evaluate the implications of LSST cadence and survey strategy, particularly the deep drilling fields, for continuum and emission line reverberation mapping, changing-look AGN, extreme variability quasars, and periodic variability searches. Key limitations of broadband photometric variability are identified, including variable emission line contamination, diffuse BLR continuum emission, and cadence-dependent lag recoverability. We argue that realizing LSST's full scientific potential requires community-scale, standardized variability metric pipelines, probabilistic classification integrated with alert brokers for follow-up triggering, and complementary medium-band photometric observations to isolate the accretion disk continuum. Together, these elements will enable LSST to convert photometric variability into quantitative constraints on accretion disks, BLR structure, and supermassive black hole growth across cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing of gravitational wave (GW) will become the next frontier in studying cosmology and gravity. While time-delay cosmography using quadruply lensed GW events associated with optical images of the lens systems can provide precise measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), they are considered to be much rarer than doubly lensed events. In this work, we analyze time-delay cosmography with doubly lensed GW events for the first time. We generate mock doubly lensed GW events with designed sensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O5 network, with LIGO post-O5 upgrade, and with Einstein Telescope (ET) + Cosmic Explorer (CE) respectively, and select the events that can be associated with future galaxy surveys. Over 1000 realizations, we find an average of 0.2(2.4) qualified events with the LVK O5(post-O5) network. Whereas with the ET+CE network, we find an average of 73.2 qualified events over 100 realizations. Using the Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) lens model, we jointly estimate waveform parameters and the impact parameter with doubly lensed GW signals, and then forecast the constraints on cosmological parameters and modified GW propagation by combining time-delay cosmography and the standard siren approach. The average posterior gives a constraint on $H_0$ with a relative uncertainty of $14\%$, $10\%$ and $0.42\%$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model for the LVK O5, LVK post-O5, and ET+CE network, respectively. While the LVK network gives uninformative constraints on the $(w_0,w_a)$ dynamical dark energy model, the ET+CE network yields a moderate constraint of $w_0=-1.02^{+0.31}_{-0.22}$ and $w_a=0.48^{+0.99}_{-1.54}$. In addition, our method can provide precise constraints on modified GW propagation effects jointly with $H_0$.

 - **Abstract**
 Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are among the densest stellar systems in the Universe and often coexist with supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at galaxy centres. While SMBH formation histories are essentially lost, NSCs preserve evolutionary imprints through their stellar populations and stellar kinematics, reflecting the cumulative effects of mergers, accretion, and internal dynamical evolution. We aim to investigate the orbital structure of the unusually large NSC in FCC 47 (NGC 1336) by decomposing its stellar orbits into dynamically distinct components. We extract stellar kinematics, and in particular the line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs), from VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy using the non-parametric Bayes-LOSVD approach, and apply triaxial Schwarzschild orbit-superposition modelling with the DYNAMITE software. We decompose the orbit library into hot, warm, cold, and counter-rotating components. We detect triple-peaked LOSVDs in the nucleus, indicating a complex orbital structure. The NSC forms a counter-rotating, kinematically decoupled component. A hot pressure-supported component, a warm counter-rotating structure and a counter-rotating cold disk in the centre suggest hierarchical assembly via early star cluster accretion and later in situ star formation. Our orbital decomposition of FCC 47 supports a hybrid formation scenario for this NSC. Dynamically distinct substructures reflect the interplay of accretion and in situ star formation during galaxy evolution.

#### Critical Evaluation of Studies Alleging Evidence for Technosignatures in the POSS1-E Photographic Plates

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies by B. Villarroel and colleagues have assembled and analyzed datasets of unidentified features measured from digital scans of photographic plates captured by the first-epoch Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS1) in the pre-Sputnik era. These studies have called attention to (i) a purported deficit of features within Earth's shadow; (ii) the sporadic presence of linear clusters; and (iii) a positive correlation between the timing of feature observations and nuclear tests as well as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) sighting reports. These observations were cited as evidence that some fraction of the unidentified features represent glinting artificial objects near Earth. We have examined these claims using two related, previously published datasets. When analyzing the most vetted of these, we do not observe the reported deficit in the terrestrial shadow. We determine that a third of the features in the reported linear clusters were not confidently distinguished from catalog stars. We find that the reported correlation between the timing of feature observations and nuclear tests becomes insignificant after properly normalizing by the number of observation days, and is almost completely determined by the observation schedule of the Palomar telescope. We uncover important inconsistencies in the definitions of the datasets used in these studies, as well as the use of unvalidated datasets containing catalog stars, scan artifacts, and plate defects. It has not been shown that any of the features in these datasets represent optical transients. We examine the spatial distribution of the plate-derived features, finding an overall gradual increase in number density toward the corners and edges of plates, as well as examples of (i) empty north-south strips that span multiple plates; (ii) clusters and voids having geometric shapes; and (iii) amorphous clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of broad H$\beta$ variability properties for all spectra of quasars with $z<0.8$ and at least two observations included in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 16 quasar catalog. For each spectrum, we perform a spectral decomposition to isolate the broad H$\beta$ emission. We measure the luminosity, FWHM, equivalent width, centroid, and Pearson skewness coefficient of broad H$\beta$ and provide derived physical properties such as the single-epoch black hole mass and the bolometric luminosity. For each pair of spectra in the sample, we calculate the change in radial velocity of the centroid of broad H$\beta$ emission ($\Delta v_{rad}$) as well as other derived properties related to broad H$\beta$ shape variability. We use forward-modeling methods to estimate the uncertainty in our measurements and discuss an improved method for estimating the uncertainty in $\Delta v_{rad}$ in the case where a spectral decomposition is used to isolate the broad H$\beta$ emission. We find that $\Delta v_{rad}$ is not normally distributed and that the shape of the distribution depends on the interval between observations. We discuss the effect of the predominance of the Reverberation Mapping subsample in the sample of pairs of spectra in SDSS.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the effects of emission geometry on the capability to constrain black hole parameters from measurements of the shadow and inner-shadow of a Reissner-Nordström black hole. We investigate the capability to constrain mass, charge, observer inclination, and emission co-latitude from images of black hole accretion flows that would arise from thick and thin accretion disks. We confirm previous studies that have shown that independent radii measurements of the shadow and inner-shadow can constrain black hole parameters if the viewing inclination is known, but find that it is only possible if the true emission geometry is also assumed. We study the constraining capabilities of the shadow and inner-shadow observations of M87* and Sgr A* like systems within the context of the BHEX and NgEHT future observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 BE Lyncis (BE Lyn) is a well-studied high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti variable star (HADS). Recently, Niu et al. (2026) analyzed a 39-year baseline of times of maximum light of BE Lyn, reporting that it is the most eccentric binary known ($e \approx 0.9989$) and hosts the nearest black hole (BH) known to date. We analyze Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry of BE Lyn, predicting what the observed proper motion anomaly (PMA) over the 25 year baseline between the two missions would be were the companion really a $\gtrsim 17.5\,M_{\odot}$ BH. We find that the predicted PMA is at least an order of magnitude larger than the observed value of $\approx 1.7 \pm 0.8$ mas yr$^{-1}$, regardless of the assumed orientation of the orbit. We predict the expected Gaia DR3 RUWE for different orientations of the putative BH binary, finding that it ranges from $\approx 2.5$-$4.0$, much larger than the reported value of $1.073$. The observed value is instead consistent with a low-mass secondary or a single star. We find that BE Lyncis would have received a 7-parameter acceleration solution if it were a BH binary, in contradiction with its absence from the Gaia DR3 non-single star catalogs. Finally, we show that the reported orbit is impossible because the luminous star would overflow its Roche lobe at periastron, irrespective of inclination. We recommend caution in interpreting light-travel time effect (LTTE) models that require very high eccentricities, face-on inclinations, or large companion masses. The observed pulsation timing variations are most likely simply a result of red noise or pulsation phase evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 The sound speed of dark energy encodes fundamental information about the microphysics underlying cosmic acceleration, yet remains essentially unconstrained by existing observations. We demonstrate that a lunar-based laser interferometer, such as the proposed Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA), can directly probe the sound speed of dark energy by measuring the real-time evolution of horizon-scale gravitational potentials. Operating in the ultra-low-frequency gravitational band inaccessible from Earth, LILA is sensitive to scalar metric perturbations sourced by dark energy dynamics. Using both fluid and effective field theory descriptions, we develop a complete framework linking dark energy sound speed to observable strain signatures. We construct a likelihood pipeline and Fisher forecasts, showing that LILA can either detect clustering dark energy or exclude broad classes of models with unprecedented sensitivity. This establishes lunar interferometry as a novel and powerful probe of the physics driving cosmic acceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the relationship between dynamical instability and thermodynamic phase transitions in four-dimensional Anti--de Sitter black holes in Einstein gravity coupled to a nonlinear power-law electromagnetic field with exponent $p = 3/4$. In the canonical ensemble, we identify a critical electric charge $Q_c$ separating a regime exhibiting a first-order small/large black-hole (SBH/LBH) phase transition from a regime with a single thermodynamically stable phase. For both massless and massive probes, the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda(T)$ becomes multivalued in the SBH/LBH coexistence region and exhibits a finite discontinuity at the transition temperature. This jump vanishes continuously as $Q \to Q_c$, signaling the termination of the first-order transition at a second-order critical point. Near criticality, the Lyapunov discontinuity obeys a universal mean-field scaling law with critical exponent $1/2$. For massless probes, we further analyze the critical impact parameter $b_c$, which displays the same multivalued structure and critical behavior as the Lyapunov exponent. We also demonstrate that the spinodal temperatures, defined by the extrema of the $T(r_h)$ curve where the heat capacity at fixed charge diverges, coincide with singular features in the Lyapunov exponent. Our results identify the Lyapunov exponent as a unified dynamical probe capable of capturing both first-order phase coexistence and second-order critical behavior in black-hole thermodynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate numerically the existence of solutions of five-dimensional vacuum gravity describing the formation, in finite time, of an extremal rotating black hole from a pre-existing Schwarzschild black hole. This is the first example of a violation of the third law of black hole mechanics in vacuum gravity and demonstrates that the third law is false independently of any matter model. We also demonstrate the existence of solutions describing the formation, in finite time, of an extremal rotating black hole from vacuum initial data that does not contain a black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article we first develop novel Rindler-type representations of flat spacetime by demonstrating that the standard hyperbolic transformation is a member of an infinite family of coordinate mappings. We specifically introduce cyclic coordinates, which, in contrast to the conventional Rindler wedge, delineate a compact region of Minkowski spacetime. By extending this framework, and motivated by near horizon coordinates in Schwarzschild metric, we propose a class of Spherical Rindler metrics. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by deriving and analyzing a black hole solution and a cosmological metric, both emerging naturally from a Spherical Rindler origin. Our results highlight unique geometric properties of these solutions, providing new insights into the relationship between accelerated frames and global spacetime curvature.

#### Rethinking Resonance Detectability during Binary Neutron Star Inspiral: Accurate Mismatch Computations for Low-lying Dynamical Tides

 - **Abstract**
 We compute deviations from observed gravitational wave signals, where the amplitude of the signal is unchanged. As an example, we consider the detectability of low lying dynamical tides in binary neutron star or neutron star black hole mergers. Tidal forces can excite oscillatory modes of one or both of the stars in the binary when the orbital frequency of the binary system sweeps through the resonant mode frequency dissipating energy into the vibrational mode. The orbital energy loss to the vibrational mode extracts energy from the orbital motion, advancing the time to merger. The inspiral then continues with an excess phase and a time advance. Both will cause a mismatch when fitting to a system that has not gone through the resonance. To resolve this effect, we compute the mismatch for current and planned detectors using both a quasi-analytical approach that relies on the computation of moment integrals and an optimized version of the standard numerical match function. We conclude that detectability can occur for time advances of the order of 1 ms with advanced LVK detectors for an excess energy-flux that is a few percent of the gravitational wave emission. Our results contrast with previous work, which model this effect solely as a phase shift of the waveform or by using the difference in the number of cycles induced by the resonant behavior. We show that tidal resonance effects primarily cause a time advance of the merger, rather than a phase difference, and that the single-frequency approximation commonly used in the literature significantly overestimates the detectability of this effect.

 - **Abstract**
 Belenchia et al. [Phys. Rev. D 98, 126009 (2018)] have analyzed a gedankenexperiment where two observers, Alice and Bob, attempt to communicate via superluminal signals using a superposition of massive particles dressed by Newtonian fields and a test particle as field detector. Quantum fluctuations in the particle motion and in the field prevent signaling or violations of quantum mechanics in this setup. We reformulate this thought experiment by considering gravitational waves emitted by an extended quadrupolar object as a detector for Newtonian tidal fields. We find that quantum fluctuations in the gravitational waves prevent signaling. In the Newtonian limit, rotating black holes behave as extended quadrupolar objects, as consequence of the strong equivalence principle. It follows that consistency of the Newtonian limit of general relativity with quantum mechanics requires the quantization of gravitational radiation, even when the waves originate in strong gravity sources.

 Exact, analytic, asymptotically flat rotating black-hole solutions are exceedingly rare, with only a handful of examples known. Using a Kerr-Schild ansatz, we derive a multitude of exact, analytic, asymptotically flat rotating black-hole solutions within a broad class of Generalized Proca theories. These black holes differ significantly from Kerr black holes, as they possess primary hair and are non-circular, thus breaking a symmetry that vacuum black holes exhibit in General Relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 General relativity has its successes at the local astrophysical level, however, it seems to be insufficient in describing the Universe at large scales. In this work we investigate how the most general field theories in the context of general relativity can accomodate a phantom-to-quintessence transition which may be essential element of realistic Dark Energy scenarios in the late Universe. As we demonstrate in a very detailed manner, this is impossible for a canonical and minimally coupled single scalar field theory, but it may be possible for ghost condensate theories like $k$-essence theories. We point out how the ghost instabilities may be eliminated, and we analyze the quantitative features of a $k$-essence theory that may realize a phantom-to-quintessence transition in the late Universe. We also qualitatively compare the difficulties and fine-tunings required for $k$-essence theories to realize a phantom-to-quintessence transition, and how such a transition is naturally realized in modified gravity, without unnecessary fine-tunings and ghost eliminations.

 The formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) generally requires large density perturbations, which is widely supported by researchers. This paper studies the local coupling properties of the Starobinsky potential and KKLT potential by introducing a linear Lorentzian-type coupling, which locally breaks the slow roll conditions. We found that both positive and negative coupling can form a considerable abundance of PBH. Additionally, we also studied the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) generated by this model.

 - **Abstract**
 Building upon the long-standing paradigm that dynamics near a spacelike singularity are governed by a sequence of Kasner epochs, we demonstrate that this picture is fundamentally altered when higher-curvature or quantum gravitational corrections are included. By incorporating such terms alongside a minimally coupled scalar field, we discover three distinct dynamical phases near the singularity: modified Kasner eons, persistent periodic oscillations, and oscillatory spike dynamics with growing amplitude. In particular, the Kasner-like geometry persisting only in highly constrained situations. The latter two regimes represent a clean departure from classical Kasner phenomenology, revealing a richer and more ordered landscape of behaviors in the deep interior of black holes beyond Einstein gravity. This work establishes a comprehensive approach for understanding the gravitational nonlinearity in the most extreme gravitational environment.

 - **Abstract**
 An increasing number of surveys has been reporting large-scale peculiar motions with sizes and speeds in excess of those allowed by the concordance cosmological model. These are the so called bulk flows, the presence of which has come to be treated as a problem for the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. However, the limits of the $\Lambda$CDM model are based on Newtonian studies, which predict the mediocre $v\propto t^{1/3}$ growth-rate for the peculiar-velocity field ($v$). Recently, a few fully relativistic treatments have appeared in the literature, arguing for a much stronger velocity growth that could explain the reported fast and deep bulk flows. What separates the Newtonian from the relativistic studies is the gravitational input of the peculiar flux, namely of the kinetic energy triggered by the moving matter. The latter has no direct gravitational contribution in Newtonian theory, but it does so in general relativity. This drastically changes the driving agent of the peculiar-velocity field and boosts its linear growth. The aim of this work is to directly compare the two treatments, as well as identify and discuss the reasons for their different results. In the process, we also demonstrate how one could recover the relativistic growth-rate from a Newtonian setup by selectively including certain (typically ignored) source-free terms into the Poisson equation. This way, we provide a unified covariant comparison of the Newtonian, the quasi-Newtonian and the fully relativistic studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes exactly incorporating quantum matter backreaction effects, namely, quantum black holes, are notoriously difficult to construct, let alone study their horizon thermodynamics. Here, we derive the thermodynamics of three-dimensional charged and rotating quantum black holes via the tree-level gravitational partition function. Specifically, we primarily focus on holographic quantum BTZ black holes, dual to $(3+1)$-dimensional accelerating black holes in anti-de Sitter space that localize on Karch-Randall end-of-the-world (ETW) branes. To derive their horizon thermodynamics, we regulate the bulk Euclidean geometry by adding a second ETW brane at asymptotic spatial infinity. We compute the on-shell action of the complexified accelerating black hole in the grand canonical ensemble and derive the quantum BTZ black hole thermodynamics, where the thermal entropy is equal to the generalized entropy. This provides a first principles derivation of the generalized entropy of three-dimensional quantum black holes. Further, we construct charged and rotating quantum black holes in three-dimensional de Sitter and Minkowski space using Randall-Sundrum ETW branes, and compute their horizon thermodynamics.

 Recent studies have shown that dark matter halos can support regular black holes or compact stars by assuming an anisotropic energy-momentum tensor. In this paper, we extend the analysis to the dark matter halo as an isotropic perfect fluid. By employing galactic dark matter profiles-specifically the Einasto and Dehnen models-as the mass-energy density source, we numerically solve the Einstein field equations and find a class of non-singular, horizonless compact star solutions. Moreover, these configurations remain stable against axial perturbations while satisfying the dominant energy condition.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform fully nonlinear, spherically symmetric numerical simulations of superhorizon false-vacuum-domain (FVD) collapse in a coupled gravity-scalar-fluid system to study primordial black hole (PBH) formation during delayed first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). Using adaptive mesh refinement to resolve the bubble wall, we identify three dynamical outcomes: type B (supercritical) PBHs with an interior baby universe and a bifurcating trapping horizon, type A (subcritical) PBHs with an apparent horizon formed by direct wall collapse, and dispersal with no PBH formation. To separate these three cases, we evaluate two commonly used PBH-formation criteria: the time scale ratio $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ (horizon crossing time versus vacuum-energy domination time) and the local density contrast $\delta(t_\mathrm{H})$ at horizon crossing. For the parameter space explored, we find that $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ is a more robust predictor of outcome: type B PBHs form when $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V} \gtrsim 1$ (critical range $\sim 1.1 - 1.6$ in our survey), type A PBHs arise when $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ is below this threshold but remains above a lower bound (typical range $\sim 0.35 - 0.7$), and no-PBH dispersal occurs when $t_\mathrm{H}/t_\mathrm{V}$ falls below this lower bound. When a clear thin-wall FVD boundary exists, $\delta(t_\mathrm{H})$ can correspondingly distinguish different outcomes (roughly $\delta_c(t_\mathrm{H}) \sim 1 - 1.7$ for type B and $\delta_c(t_\mathrm{H}) \sim 0.35 - 0.5$ for type A), but is highly sensitive to wall structure and model details and thus less universal. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of FVD collapse, quantify practical PBH-formation thresholds, and pave the way for precise predictions of PBH abundance from delayed FOPTs.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present a full description of the spherically decomposed Green's function of a non-rotating black hole, which naturally splits into three components: the direct part, the quasinormal modes, and the tail. Both the direct part and the tail are contributed by branch cut integrals on the complex-frequency domain, and the quasinormal modes correspond to poles of the Green's function. We show that these different components match the Green's function numerically obtained by solving a time-domain Regge-Wheeler code. In addition, the components of the Green's function also agree with earlier studies in Schwarzschild spacetime with small cosmological constant. The identification of all the various parts of the Schwarzschild Green's function represents an important step towards analyzing direct waves and quasinormal modes in the ringdown stage of binary black hole coalescence, as well as their nonlinear interaction near the merger.

 - **Abstract**
 Generalized Proca Theories are the most general higher-derivative extensions of a massive vector field that retain second-order equations of motion. They are phenomenologically interesting as models of dynamical dark energy that, unlike scalar-tensor theories, can naturally accommodate cosmological anisotropies. A key open question is whether such theories can be fundamental. As a first step in this direction, we investigate whether they admit an ultraviolet completion within a quantum field theory framework, working with a truncation comprising up to four powers of the Proca field and up to two derivatives. We find a triplet of non-Gaussian ultraviolet fixed points, that lie very close to one another. Only one of them features a non-tachyonic Proca mass and could thus serve as a consistent ultraviolet completion for Generalized Proca Theories. We name it the Proca fixed point. We discuss its stability and contrast its features with those of the standard Reuter fixed point of the asymptotic safety scenario for quantum gravity and matter. In particular, we show that the Gaussian and Reuter fixed points lie on singular hypersurfaces of the flow of Generalized Proca Theories, yet can act as quasi-fixed points in certain regimes.

 - **Abstract**
 The tensionless limit probes the very high energy regime of string theory in contrast to the well studied point-particle limit which reduces to Einstein gravity. Tensionless strings sweep out null worldsheets in the target space and hence are also called null strings. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of tensionless null string theory beginning with the initial work of Schild, and continuing to the foundational work of Isberg et al (ILST) and then focussing on developments in the past decade. Recent work centres on the emergence of the Carrollian Conformal Algebra as residual worldsheet symmetries of the ILST action and the identification of tensionless limit as a worldsheet Carrollian limit on the string worldsheet. Carrollian structures are used to address the classical and quantum aspects of the null string. In the classical theory, the aforementioned limit agrees with the analysis from the ILST action. Symmetries, constraints, mode expansions computed from both perspectives match nicely providing a robust cross-check of the analyses. We discuss closed and open null strings as well as their supersymmetric cousins. The quantum null string comes with several surprises, the foremost of which is the emergence of three consistent quantum theories from the ILST action. We detail the canonical quantisation and the spectrum of the triumvirate of theories. We discuss the novelties of the quantum null theories and the effect compactifaction has on them. We also discuss Carroll strings, applications of these ideas to strings approaching black holes and give a quick overview of other related developments.

 - **Abstract**
 In General Relativity, the tidal Love numbers of black holes vanish, implying they are resistant to tidal deformation. This "rigidity" is easily broken in the presence of higher-derivative corrections. Focusing on extremal charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell EFT, we compute the static linear response for both the vector ($\ell=1$) and parity-odd tensor ($\ell \ge 2$) sectors. We find that the resulting tidal Love numbers are non-zero and exhibit logarithmic running, a hallmark of quantum corrections. Crucially, we show that the sign of these deformations is not arbitrary; the induced electric and magnetic susceptibilities and their log runnings in the $\ell=1$ sector are constrained by unitarity and the Weak Gravity Conjecture. Furthermore, due to gravito-electromagnetic mixing, we find the cross log runnings and show that they are the same, which we explain through the worldline effective field theory.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by recent progress in the high-energy description of gravitational scattering, we develop a systematic Regge-theory framework for $2\to2+n$ amplitudes describing the scattering of two massive particles with $n$ graviton emissions, including spin effects. Working in the ultra-relativistic limit at leading logarithmic accuracy, the massive result smoothly reduces to its massless counterpart. We describe both quantum (Regge trajectory and BFKL $t$-channel evolution) and classical ($s$-channel multi-$H$ evolution) contributions using both an exponential representation of the S-matrix and a shock-wave formalism in light-cone quantisation. In the latter approach, gravitational Wilson lines evolve in rapidity space under a boost-invariant Hamiltonian, providing a space-time realisation of the high-energy dynamics and making contact with recent effective field theory descriptions in the forward limit. As an application, we compute the leading-logarithmic contribution to the massive spinless $2\to2$ amplitude at 5PM-2SF order, recovering the previously determined massless result, and derive the tree-level $2\to3$ amplitude and its associated scattering waveform for Kerr black holes in the ultra-relativistic limit.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the formation, detection and coarse-graining of black holes in AdS/CFT, with an emphasis on the tension between boundary unitarity and the production of mixed state Hawking radiation in the bulk. We construct CFT states dual to black hole formation and evaporation by colliding bulk particle wavepackets at trans-Planckian energy. We propose boundary probes which are able to distinguish small AdS black holes from other states within the microcanonical ensemble. We investigate different coarse-graining prescriptions acting on the evolving CFT state, including averaging over CFT data, Hamiltonians and time windows, and compare their purities to those expected from the bulk semiclassical description. Our results clarify how semiclassical black hole behaviour can arise from an ensemble-averaging of the exact unitary dynamics, and take a step towards a better understanding of coarse-graining in the single-sided black hole information problem.

 - **Abstract**
 Corrections to vacuum black hole solutions of general relativity (GR) are considered in an effective field theory (EFT) framework, perturbatively in EFT coefficients, focusing on the Schwarzschild solution of GR. We find dominant corrections to the Schwarzschild metric in all orders in the derivative expansion far away from the horizon. These corrections can be summed up in a closed form through EFT coefficients up to all orders in derivatives and to the second order in curvature. It occurs that such a summation is convergent only for localizable theories, making a direct connection between the graviton scattering amplitudes properties and the applicability of a perturbative treatment of an EFT of gravity. We further apply our results to logarithmic form-factors which appear in the 1-loop effective action for GR in four dimensions. We find out that the corresponding corrections to the Schwarzschild metric are stronger than those from the tree-level EFT operators. The developed framework can be extended to account for the corrections to the other BH solutions in GR, such as the Kerr metric.

 - **Abstract**
 It has been shown that a very old black hole can tunnel into a white hole through the emission of a large baby universe. This process can be modeled by a genus-one geometry corresponding to a single baby universe emission, with a tunneling probability proportional to \( t^{2} e^{-2S(E)} \), where \( t \) denotes the black hole age and \( S(E) \) its entropy at energy \( E \). The growth of this probability at late times raises the question of its behavior near \( t \sim e^{S} \). A natural possibility is that the full genus expansion, together with its non-perturbative completion, leads to saturation of the tunneling probability. Motivated by this idea, the present analysis employs a non-perturbative bulk inner product in place of the perturbative one and shows that, at late times, the probabilities of realizing firewall geometries and smooth geometries approach constant values.
