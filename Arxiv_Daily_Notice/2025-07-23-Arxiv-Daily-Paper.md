 - **Abstract**
 High-precision regression of physical parameters from black hole images generated by General Relativistic Ray Tracing (GRRT) is essential for investigating spacetime curvature and advancing black hole astrophysics. However, due to limitations in observational resolution, high observational costs, and imbalanced distributions of positive and negative samples, black hole images often suffer from data scarcity, sparse parameter spaces, and complex structural characteristics. These factors pose significant challenges to conventional regression methods based on simplified physical models. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces Multiscale Adaptive Network (MANet) , a novel regression framework grounded in deep learning. MANet integrates an Adaptive Channel Attention (ACA) module to selectively enhance features in physically informative regions. Meanwhile, a Multiscale Enhancement Feature Pyramid (MEFP) is employed to capture fine-grained spatial structures such as photon rings and accretion disks, while alleviating information loss due to downsampling. Experimental evaluations on GRRT-simulated datasets demonstrate that MANet substantially improves parameter estimation accuracy and generalization capability in high-dimensional parameter spaces, outperforming existing baseline approaches. This framework presents a promising avenue for high-precision parameter regression in Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data analysis and broader astrophysical imaging applications characterized by sparse and noisy data.

#### The HETDEX Survey: Probing neutral hydrogen in the circumgalactic medium of ~88,000 Lyman Alpha Emitters

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the neutral hydrogen (H I) gas around 1.9 < z < 3.5 Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) using faint Ly$\alpha$ absorption. This absorption is the result of H I in the halo of the LAE scattering Ly$\alpha$ photons from the integrated light of background galaxies along the line of sight. We stack millions of spectra from regions around ~88,000 LAEs to focus on the physics of the gas at large radii. The extensive number of fiber spectra contributing to the stacks ensures significant signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to detect the faint Ly$\alpha$ absorption which would otherwise be buried within the noise. We detect absorption out to a projected ~350 kpc around an average LAE at z~2.5. We use these results to create an empirical radial $W_\lambda$(Ly$\alpha$) profile around LAEs. Comparison with numerical simulations reveals a profile similar to the empirical one within this region. Compared to previous studies, the profile is similar but modestly higher. We also outline a simple physical picture motivated by the observed trends in the data. We plan to quantify this radial profile as a function of redshift, local density, and Ly$\alpha$ luminosity to explore the relationship between LAE environments and H I distribution.

#### Resolving Black Hole Family Issues Among the Massive Ancestors of Very High-Spin Gravitational-Wave Events Like GW231123

 - **Abstract**
 The latest detection of GW231123, a binary black hole (BH) merger with exceptionally large masses and high spins for the incoming components, has been suggested as a smoking gun for hierarchical formation. In this scenario, a first generation of BHs resulting from collapsing stars form in a dense environment. Here they can assemble dynamically and undergo subsequent mergers. We discuss three challenges for the formation of a GW231123-like event inside a star cluster: 1) The high masses of the incoming BHs appear to be in the predicted pair-instability mass gap and thus suggest that second-generation or higher-order generation BHs are involved. 2) Very high spins ($\chi_f \gtrsim 0.8$) are very unlikely for dynamically assembled BHs because of the isotropic distribution of spin vectors. 3) Hierarchically formed BHs are susceptible to receive large recoils, which could kick them out of their cluster. We simulate this scenario and show that only a few percent of mergers recover remnants within GW231123's primary spin estimate $\chi_1=0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and are retained inside typical star clusters. A large fraction of very rapidly spinning second-generation BHs (including $\chi_f>0.9$) can only form if the first-generation BHs merges with aligned spins. This is a natural outcome of massive binary star evolution scenarios, such as a chemically homogeneous evolution. This scenario also predicts equal masses for the components, implying that the resulting BHs tend to receive very low recoil kicks and would therefore likely be retained inside a cluster. We conclude that GW231123-like events, if formed in a star cluster, could require first-generation BHs with large aligned spins that evolved through stellar binary interaction, followed by the dynamical assembly for a subsequent merger. We discuss the implications for the uncertain lower edge of the putative mass gap 60-130 $\rm M_\odot$.

#### Red Supergiants as Supernova Progenitors

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15973

 - **Abstract**
 The inevitable fate of massive stars in the initial mass range of ~8--30 M_{Sun} in the red supergiant (RSG) phase is a core-collapse supernova (SN) explosion, although some stars may collapse directly to a black hole. We know that this is the case, since RSGs have been directly identified and characterized for a number of supernovae (SNe) in pre-explosion archival optical and infrared images. RSGs likely all have some amount of circumstellar matter (CSM), through nominal mass loss, although evidence exists that some RSGs must experience enhanced mass loss during their lifetimes. The SNe from RSGs are hydrogen-rich Type II-Plateau (II-P), and SNe II-P at the low end of the luminosity range tend to arise from low-luminosity RSGs. The typical spectral energy distribution (SED) for such RSGs can generally be fit with a cool photospheric model, whereas the more luminous RSG progenitors of more luminous SNe II-P tend to require a greater quantity of dust in their CSM to account for their SEDs. The SN II-P progenitor luminosity range is log(L_{bol}/L_{Sun}) ~ 4.0--5.2. The fact RSGs are known up to log(L_{bol}/L_{Sun}) ~ 5.7 leads to the so-called ``RSG problem'', which may, in the end, be a result of small number of available statistics to date.

 - **Abstract**
 The action of gravitational physics across space-time creates observable signatures in the behaviour of light and matter. We perform combined-probe studies using data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1), in combination with three existing weak lensing surveys, to test and constrain General Relativity (GR) in the context of the standard model of cosmology (LCDM). We focus on measuring the gravitational estimator statistic, E_G, which describes the relative amplitudes of weak gravitational lensing and galaxy velocities induced by a common set of overdensities. By comparing our amplitude measurements with their predicted scale- and redshift-dependence within the GR+LCDM model, we demonstrate that our results are consistent with the predictions of the Planck cosmology. The redshift span of the DESI dataset allows us to perform these E_G measurements at the highest redshifts achieved to date, z ~ 1.

 - **Abstract**
 While cold dark matter is widely supported by a range of cosmological observations, it encounters several difficulties at smaller scales. These issues have prompted the investigation of various alternative dark matter candidates, leaving the question "What is dark matter?" still open. In this work, we propose a new cosmological model that considers dark matter as a barotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter and interprets dark energy as the phenomenological emergent dark energy rather than a cosmological constant. We then place constraints on our new model using the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy measurements, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the Pantheon Plus (PP) compilation of Type Ia supernovae (Ia SNe), and the Redshift Space Distortions (RSD) data from Gold2018. The results show statistically significant signal for positive dark matter equation of state and square of sound speed $w_{\rm dm}=c_{\rm s,dm}^2$ ($10^{7}w_{\rm dm}$ = $4.0^{+2.5}_{-2.3}$ at the 95\% confidence level) for the data combination CMB+DESI+PP+RSD. However, Bayesian evidence indicates that this data combination favors the $\Lambda$CDM model with very strong evidence.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the utility of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) as novel observational probes to constrain models of interacting dark energy (IDE). By leveraging FRB dispersion measures (DMs) and redshifts, we perform a comprehensive analysis of three IDE models: gamma_m IDE, gamma_x IDE, and xi IDE, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods based on 86 localized FRBs and simulated datasets containing 2500 to 10000 mock events. By disentangling the contributions to the observed DMs from the Milky Way, host galaxies, and the intergalactic medium (IGM), key cosmological parameters are constrained, including the Hubble constant (H0), matter density (Omega_m), the dark energy equation of state (omega_x), and interaction strengths (gamma_m, gamma_x, xi). The best-fit values of the gamma_m IDE model indicate a potential alleviation of the cosmic coincidence problem. Subsequently, we utilize information criteria (IC) to conduct a comparative assessment of the three IDE models. When applied to the current sample of observed FRBs, the xi IDE model yields slightly lower IC values than the gamma_m IDE and gamma_x IDE models across all three criteria, although the differences are not statistically significant. These results underscore the value of FRB measurements as complementary probes that provide further constraints on alternative cosmological models.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrinos and dark energy (DE) have entered a new era of investigation, as the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements tighten the constraints on the neutrino mass and suggest that DE may be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of simultaneously incorporating $\sum m_\nu$ and $N_{\rm eff}$ within the framework of dynamical DE. A joint analysis of DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background, DESY5 supernova, and DESY1 weak lensing data yields a total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu = 0.098^{+0.016}_{-0.037}\,\mathrm{eV}$, indicating a preference for a positive neutrino mass at the $2.7\sigma$ level within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. This work highlights the important influence of the strength of evidence for dynamically evolving DE on the measurement of neutrino mass, with stronger evidence for DE dynamics leading to a larger neutrino mass. These results underscore the importance of measuring the neutrino mass within the framework of dynamical DE, particularly in light of the forthcoming, more complete DESI data releases.

#### Inference of matter power spectrum at z=0 using DESI DR1 Full-Shape data

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of galaxy distributions at large cosmic distances capture clustering from the past. In this study, we use a cosmological model to translate these observations into the present-day galaxy distribution. Specifically, we reconstruct the 3D matter power spectrum at redshift $ z = 0 $ using Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Year 1 (DR1) galaxy clustering data and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations, assuming the $ \Lambda \text{CDM} $ model, and compare it to the result assuming the $ w_0w_a \text{CDM} $ model. Building on previous state-of-the-art methods, we apply Effective Field Theory (EFT) modelling of the galaxy power spectrum to account for small-scale effects in the 2-point statistics of galaxy data. The EFT approach offers a more robust methodology than traditional methods for modelling the galaxy power spectrum from galaxy clustering data, which can be used to test the consistency of the assumed cosmological model. By incorporating both CMB and galaxy clustering data across a range of redshifts, we can identify discrepancies between the datasets, which would indicate potential inaccuracies in the assumed expansion history. While previous studies have shown consistency with $ \Lambda \text{CDM} $, this work extends the analysis with higher-quality data to further test the expansion histories of both $ \Lambda \text{CDM} $ and $ w_0w_a \text{CDM} $. Our findings show that both $ \Lambda \text{CDM} $ and $ w_0w_a \text{CDM} $ provide consistent fits to the matter power spectrum recovered from DESI DR1 data.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider models where the dilaton, seen as the pseudo-Goldstone boson of broken scale invariance, plays the role of dark energy. We revisit Weinberg's theorem and show that quantum corrections induced by the graviton lead to the screening of the dilaton locally. We also discuss the time evolution of the equation of state and find that phantom crossing is a natural feature of these models. The time variation of the equation of state and its deviation from $-1$ is limited by screening locally and can only be relaxed when the dilaton is allowed to have a mass of the order of the Hubble rate cosmologically, thus going beyond single-field screened dark-energy models. This obstruction extends to all single-field screened models of the chameleon-type where the large mass of the scalar on cosmological scales leads to a negligible variation of the equation of state at low redshift.

#### Primordial black holes with anisotropic hair

 - **Abstract**
 A mechanism for generating anisotropic enhancements of the curvature perturbation through a vector field is proposed. We find that when the mixing between the inflaton perturbation and the vector-field perturbation is sufficiently strong in the anisotropic inflation, the power spectrum becomes dominated by anisotropic constant modes. This suggests that statistical anisotropy in primordial black hole (PBH) formation may be inevitable if inflation undergoes an anisotropic inflationary phase. Our findings offer a novel approach to probe vector fields during inflation and to test the cosmic no-hair conjecture.

 - **Abstract**
 I construct a set of master field equations encompassing all possible second-order field equations for spherically symmetric spacetimes beyond general relativity. The structure of 2-dimensional Horndeski theory is leveraged to define a spherically symmetric gravitational tensor that is identically conserved and can play an equivalent role as the Einstein tensor in the coupling to spherically symmetric stress-energy tensors. The master field equations provide a framework in which to study a wide variety of previously intractable problems and prove general results across different theories, as illustrated with the example of the Jebsen--Birkhoff theorem that holds generally. This work sets up the stage for the study of the dynamics of spherically symmetric spacetimes beyond general relativity and provides powerful tools for the exploration of a new paradigm of black hole physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Parameter estimation (PE) for compact binary coalescence (CBC) events observed by gravitational wave (GW) laser interferometers is a core task in GW astrophysics. We present a method to compute the posterior distribution efficiently without relying on stochastic samplers. First, we show how to select sets of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that efficiently cover the relevant phase space. We then show how to compute the likelihood for all combinations of these parameters using dot products. We describe how to assess and tune the integration accuracy, making the outcome predictable and adaptable to different applications. The low computational cost allows full PE in minutes on a single CPU, with the potential for further acceleration using multiple CPUs or GPUs. We implement this method in the $\texttt{dot-PE}$ package, enabling sensitive searches using the full evidence integral for precessing CBCs and supporting large waveform banks ($\sim10^6$ waveforms), regardless of waveform generation cost.

 - **Abstract**
 The original Kerr theorem provides the foundation for Kerr-Schild transformations by classifying all shear-free and geodesic null congruences in flat spacetime; the key ingredient of the Kerr-Schild ansatz. However, due to the high level of degeneracy of the outcome it is often less practical than its symmetric refinements, which may single out congruences leading to physically significant spacetimes by imposing relevant symmetries. An illustrative example is the stationary axisymmetric version of Kerr theorem which has been shown to lead directly and uniquely to the Kerr black hole in vacuum. In this work, we propose a new symmetric refinement of the Kerr theorem by boosting the stationary symmetry into its ultrarelativistic limit to achieve invariance under null translations, while keeping axisymmetry. Under these assumptions, the classification yields only two distinct congruences. The first congruence is covariantly constant and, through the Kerr-Schild ansatz, evidently yields an axisymmetric pp-wave. The vacuum axisymmetric profile of this pp-wave displays a logarithmic dependence on the polar radius, characteristic of the exterior gravitational field of the Bonnor light beam, and includes as a special case the Aichelburg-Sexl ultrarelativistic limit of the Schwarzschild black hole. The Kerr-Schild transformation of the second congruence gives rise to a non-trivial vacuum solution recently reported in [Phys. Rev. D 112, 024020 (2025)]. Using circularity and appropriately fixing the reparameterization invariance of the orthogonal manifold to the Killing fields, we show that the latter solution corresponds to the well-known Taub-NUT spacetime with planar topology. These results emphasize how symmetry-based refinements of the Kerr theorem constitute a powerful tool to constructing physically essential spacetimes.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter (DM) remains undetected, and developing theoretical models such as the promising perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) is a key challenge in modern cosmology. In this work, we investigate the quantum characteristics of PFDM by analyzing the behavior of quantum entanglement and coherence for both fermionic and bosonic fields near a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a PFDM halo. Our results reveal that PFDM can either enhance or degrade quantum entanglement and coherence, depending sensitively on its density. Notably, bosonic entanglement shows greater susceptibility to PFDM effects compared to fermionic entanglement, while fermionic coherence exhibits a stronger dependence on PFDM than its bosonic counterpart. These findings highlight the necessity of selecting appropriate quantum probes for DM detection based on the type of quantum resources, as different quantum fields exhibit significantly different responses to PFDM in curved spacetime.

 - **Abstract**
 The uniqueness theorems for general relativity and Yang-Mills theories can be circumvented by dropping the ubiquitous, yet often implicit, assumption that physical fields, such as the spacetime metric, are fundamental. The novel concept of emergent fields makes it possible to construct modified theories of gravity and forces where the spacetime metric and strength tensor fields emerge from a covariance analysis in the canonical formulation with nontrivial relations to the fundamental phase space and no additional degrees of freedom are required. This is an example of a post-Einstein-Yang-Mills theory that implies new physics. In particular, explicit realizations of the theory in symmetry-reduced systems have shown robust resolutions of the singularities that plague the classical theories in regions of extreme spacetime curvature, including nonsingular (SU(2)xU(1)-charged) black holes with a cosmologial constant and collapsing solutions, as well as Gowdy and FLRW cosmologies. Further applications include modifications in the spectrum of quasinormal modes and in the evaporation process of black holes, as well as relativistic formulations of long-range gravitational effects capable of modeling MOND as an alternative solution to the dark matter problem. New results here include an extension of the spherically symmetric system that couples SU(2) gauge fields and the generalization of previous dynamical, homogeneous solutions.

#### From a collapsing radiating star to an evaporating black hole: A smooth transition from classical to quantum entropy

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16485

 - **Abstract**
 We present a robust mechanism where the geometrical free-gravitational entropy of an isolated astrophysical radiating star undergoing continual gravitational collapse, as measured by an external observer, makes a smooth transition to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the onset of the horizon formation and in the late times of black hole evaporation. It is interesting to note that both in the classical regime and the semi classical evaporating black hole regime, the matter is radiated via the Vaidya exterior surrounding the radiating star, as well as the evaporating black hole. Our result, being independent of the interior matter dynamics of the collapsing star, clearly indicates that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and its non-extensive nature indeed originates from the Riemannian geometry, which dictates the free-gravity entropy in general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole quasinormal modes arise as eigenmodes of a non-normal Hamiltonian and consequently they do not obey orthogonality relations with respect to commonly used inner products, for example, the energy inner product. A direct consequence of this is the appearance of transient phenomena. This review summarises current developments on the topic, both in frequency- and time-domain. In particular, we discuss the appearance of i) transient plateaus: arbitrarily long-lived sums of quasinormal modes, corresponding to localised energy packets near the future horizon; ii) transient growth, with the latter either appearing in the vicinity of black hole phase transitions or in the context of higher-derivative Sobolev norms.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed derivation of the weak-field deflection of light in the scalar hairy black hole spacetime with scalar charge $Q_s$ and bumblebee gravity black hole spacetime, characterized by a Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$. Starting from the metric, we derive the photon orbit equation up to second order in the small parameters $M/b$, $Q_s$ or $\ell$. Then we derive the weak-field deflection angle via three independent semi-analytical techniques- (1) Homotopy-Perturbation Method, (2) Variational Iteration Method, (3) Single-Impulse (Transverse-Kick) Method-are each applied in full detail. We demonstrate exact agreement among these approaches and discuss their relative computational efficiencies, thereby offering diverse tools for lensing calculations in spherically symmetric spacetimes.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the optical appearance from thin accretion disks in parametrized black holes, namely, solutions characterized by an arbitrarily large number of parameters without any regards to the theory of the gravitational and matter fields they come from. More precisely, we consider the leading-order terms of the spherically symmetric Johanssen-Psaltis (JP) and Konoplya-Zhidenko (KZ) parametrizations after imposing constraints from asymptotic flatness and solar system observations. Furthermore, we use the inferred correlation, by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration, between the size of the bright ring (which is directly observable) and the size of the central brightness depression (which is not) of M87 and Sgr A$^*$ central supermassive objects, to constrain the parameters of the leading-order JP and KZ solutions. Using ten samples of the Standard Unbound distribution previously employed in the literature to reproduce certain scenarios of General Relativistic HydroDynamical simulations, we produce images of four samples of JP and KZ geometries enhancing and diminishing the shadow's size, respectively. Via a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the features of the corresponding photon rings and, in particular, of their relative brightness, we argue that it should be possible to distinguish between such parametrized solutions and the Schwarzschild geometry via future upgrades of very long baseline interferometry. We furthermore consider images of some naked objects within these parametrizations, and also discuss the role of inclination in comparing images of different black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the non-commutative geometry inspired Reissner-Nordström black hole solution obtained by smearing the point sources with a Gaussian distribution. We show that while the form of the metric function and the physical properties derived from that remain valid, not all the components of Einstein equations are satisfied. We construct an improved energy-momentum tensor that consistently satisfies Einstein equations and show that it leads to a different prediction for the region where the strong energy condition is violated. For certain choice of parameters, our proposal predicts the violation of the energy condition outside the Cauchy horizon, which might be important for observational signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 A key test for any quasi-local energy in general relativity is that it be nonnegative and satisfy a rigidity property; if it vanishes, the region enclosed is flat. We show that the Hawking energy, when evaluated on its natural area-constrained critical surfaces, henceforth called "Hawking surfaces", satisfies both properties under the dominant energy condition. In the time-symmetric case, where Hawking surfaces coincide with area-constrained Willmore surfaces, we extend positivity and rigidity to include electric charge, a nonzero cosmological constant, and higher dimensions. In the fully dynamical (non-time-symmetric) case, we establish the first nonnegativity and rigidity theorems for the Hawking energy in this general setting. These results confirm the Hawking energy consistency with basic physical principles and address several longstanding ambiguities and criticisms.

 - **Abstract**
 In gravitational theories with boundaries, diffeomorphisms can become physical and acquire a non-vanishing Noether charge. Using the covariant phase space formalism, on shell of the gravitational constraints, the latter localizes on codimension-$2$ surfaces, the corners. The corner proposal asserts that these charges, and their algebras, must be important ingredients of any quantum gravity theory. In this manuscript, we continue the study of quantum corner symmetries and algebras by computing the entanglement entropy and quantum informational properties of quantum states abiding to the quantum representations of corners in the framework of $2$-dimensional gravity. We do so for two classes of states: the vacuum and coherent states, properly defined. We then apply our results to JT gravity, seen as the dimensional reduction of $4$d near extremal black holes. There, we demonstrate that the entanglement entropy of some coherent quantum gravity states -- states admitting a semiclassical description -- scales like the dilaton, reproducing the semiclassical area law behavior and further solidifying the quantum informational nature of entropy of quantum corners. We then study general states and their gluing procedure, finding a formula for the entanglement entropy based entirely on the representation theory of $2$d quantum corners.
