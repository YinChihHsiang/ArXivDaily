#### Bose-Einstein Condensates in Astrophysics and Cosmology: From Quantum Statistics to Cosmic Structures

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and their manifestations in astrophysical and cosmological contexts. Building upon the foundations of quantum statistics in curved spacetime, we derive the conditions for BEC formation under extreme gravitational fields and explore their implications for compact objects and early universe physics. Through rigorous mathematical treatment incorporating general relativistic corrections to the Bose-Einstein distribution, we demonstrate that BEC phenomena may play crucial roles in neutron star interiors, primordial black hole formation, and dark matter halos. Our analysis reveals that the critical temperature for condensation exhibits non-trivial dependence on spacetime curvature, with corrections of order O(GM/rc2) becoming significant near compact objects. We further show that axion dark matter, if it exists, naturally forms a cosmic BEC with coherence length {\lambda}dB ~ 10^-3 pc for ma ~ 10^-22 eV, potentially explaining the observed core-cusp problem in galactic dark matter profiles. These findings suggest that quantum coherence effects at macroscopic scales may be more prevalent in the universe than previously recognized, with profound implications for our understanding of cosmic structure formation and the behaviour of matter under extreme conditions.

#### $f$-mode Oscillations for Hyperons and H-dibaryons in Neutron Stars

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15912

 - **Abstract**
 The fundamental ($f$-mode) oscillations of neutron stars are studied within the quark meson coupling model, a relativistic Hartree-Fock theory of dense nuclear matter, which takes into account the self-consistent modification of the valence quark structure of the bound baryons in the associated strong Lorentz scalar mean fields. For the first time, hyperons and H-dibaryons are included, along with the effects of potential additional short-range repulsion within this scheme, and their influence on $f$-modes is investigated. Universal relations are studied within the relativistic Cowling approximation and compared against those in the existing literature for potential applications in gravitational wave asteroseismology.

#### Methods for Estimating Neutron Star Parameters using Multiple Mechanisms for Gravitational Wave Emission Associated with Pulsar Glitches
 - **Authors:** Matthew Ball, Raymond Frey

 - **Abstract**
 Several mechanisms for gravitational wave (GW) emission are believed to be associated with pulsar glitches. This emission may be split between long duration continuous waves and short duration bursts. In the Advanced LIGO era, searches for GWs associated with pulsar glitches have only considered continuous wave emission. The increasing sensitivity of the detectors and the prospects for future detectors suggest that astrophysically motivated analyses involving multiple mechanisms may be possible. Here, we present a framework for combining two simple models for GW emission - long duration continuous waves and short duration bursts - to derive more constraining astrophysical implications than a single model would allow. The best limits arise from using models that predict a specific amount of GW emission; however, there are relatively few models that make such predictions. We apply these methods to the December 2016 Vela pulsar glitch and make predictions for how well future observing runs and detectors would improve results. As part of this analysis, we performed a targeted search for GW bursts associated with this glitch and find no signal.

#### Exploring HI Galaxy Redshift Survey Strategies for the FAST Core Array Interferometry

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16234

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16234

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the feasibility of HI galaxy redshift surveys with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) and its proposed Core Array interferometry. Using semi-analytical simulations, we compare the performance of the FAST single-dish and Core Array modes in drift scan (DS) and on-the-fly (OTF) observations across different redshifts. Our results show that the FAST single-dish mode enables significant HI detections at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 0.35$) but is limited at higher redshifts due to shot noise. The Core Array interferometry, with higher sensitivity and angular resolution, provides robust HI galaxy detections up to $z \sim 1$, maintaining a sufficient number density for power spectrum measurements and BAO constraints. At low redshifts ($z \sim 0.01$ -- $0.08$), both configurations perform well, though cosmic variance dominates uncertainties. At higher redshifts ($z > 0.35$), the Core Array outperforms the single-dish mode, while increasing the survey area has little impact on single-dish observations due to shot noise limitations. The DS mode efficiently covers large sky areas but is constrained by Earth's rotation, whereas the OTF mode allows more flexible deep-field surveys at the cost of operational overhead. Our findings highlight the importance of optimizing survey strategies to maximize FAST's potential for HI cosmology. The Core Array is particularly well-suited for high-redshift HI galaxy surveys, enabling precise constraints on large-scale structure and dark energy.

#### Cosmological Constraints on Neutrino Masses in a Second-Order CPL Dark Energy Model
 - **Authors:** Shubham Barua, Shantanu Desai

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16238

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16238

 - **Abstract**
 Recent DESI results indicate a strong preference for dynamical dark energy (DE) when baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization. We analyze the exponential (EXP) parameterization, which introduces a second-order correction to CPL. We determine and compare the 95% upper bounds on the sum of neutrino masses for three dark energy (DE) models -- $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and EXP -- across four neutrino mass hierarchies (1 massive/2 massless, degenerate, normal, inverted) and multiple dataset combinations (CMB$+$BAO, CMB$+$BAO$+$PantheonPlus, CMB$+$BAO$+$DESY5), employing both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks with physical lower limits from oscillation experiments (0.059 eV and 0.11 eV). Our results show that CPL yields tighter ($\lesssim10$%) bounds compared to EXP. We further confirm earlier findings that neutrino mass constraints are only mildly sensitive to the assumed hierarchy and that the frequentist bounds are tighter than Bayesian ones. Furthermore, the imposed oscillation lower limits, the datasets used and the cosmological model play a crucial role in the inferred cosmological neutrino mass bounds. For the datasets, hierarchies, and DE parameterizations considered, we find no statistically significant evidence for nonzero neutrino mass consistent with oscillation lower limits.

#### Ultralight dark matter from non-slowroll inflation
 - **Authors:** Martina La Rosa, Gianmassimo Tasinato
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16455

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16455

 - **Abstract**
 The longitudinal mode of a massive vector field, generated during inflation, offers a well-motivated and phenomenologically rich candidate for dark matter. We show that a rapid variation in the mass of the vector boson, occurring during a brief phase of non-slowroll inflationary evolution, can naturally give rise to extremely small vector masses after inflation ends, corresponding to an ultralight dark matter candidate. This mechanism predicts a stochastic gravitational-wave background, generated at second order by non-adiabatic longitudinal vector fluctuations and amplified at very low frequencies, yielding a distinctive observational signature of the scenario. By leveraging a brief departure from slowroll dynamics during inflation - commonly invoked in scenarios that produce primordial black holes - our framework establishes a novel connection between ultralight vector dark matter and primordial black hole physics, suggesting a possible unified setting for mixed dark matter scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 The Einstein Telescope (ET) will be the next generation gravitational wave observatory in Europe with a sensitivity reaching beyond the CMB into the dark era of the Universe. Each corner of the triangular baseline design is the center of two interferometers with 10 km long arms, one operated at room temperature, the other one with mirrors at cryogenic temperatures of 10-15 K that reduce the noise contribution at frequencies as low as 3 Hz. The ETpathfinder (ET-PF) project at Maastricht University is a R\&D facility for the challenging cryogenic interferometer technology of ET. It is a 20m x 20m interferometer with six towers that will house the seismically decoupled cryogenic Si-mirrors, laser systems, and detectors. The KIT group developed the control system of the ultra-high vacuum system for ET-PF, based on the expertise from the KATRIN neutrino mass experiment. In addition, a test facility is currently being set up at KIT to investigate adsorption and desorption processes of residual gas on the cryogenic mirror surfaces, as well as monitoring techniques and in-situ cleaning procedures. This paper presents the objectives and status of these activities and their contribution towards the next generation gravitational wave observatory.

#### Interacting Scalar Field Cosmology from Full Quantum Gravity

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16194

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16194

 - **Abstract**
 We study the relational cosmological dynamics emerging from interacting group field theory (GFT) models minimally coupled to a massless clock scalar field and a self-interacting scalar field. We focus on two broad classes of GFT interactions - pseudosimplicial and pseudotensorial - which generalize simplicial and tensorial interactions, respectively. Treating these interactions perturbatively, we extract the effective cosmological dynamics using mean-field techniques. In the geometric sector, we identify appropriate classical limits of the resulting dynamics, characterized by the emergence of a cosmological constant term in pseudotensorial models and of dynamical dark energy in pseudosimplicial ones. In the matter sector, we find that quantum gravity interactions induce a mass term and modify the classical symmetries of the scalar field dynamics, allowing for a consistent classical matter-geometry description only for specific forms of the effective scalar field potential. Finally, we show that these quantum gravity compatibility conditions on the effective potentials can be relaxed by allowing for a scale-dependent gravitational coupling, and that this running is uniquely fixed once the classical scalar field potential is specified.

#### Non-flat Universe with Tsallis holographic dark energy

General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16280

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16280

 - **Abstract**
 We investigated evolution of metric and density perturbations for Tsallis model of holographic dark energy with energy density $\sim L^{2\gamma - 4}$, where $L$ is length of event horizon or inverse Hubble parameter and $\gamma$ is parameter of non-additivity close to $1$. Because holographic dark energy is not an ordinary cosmological fluid but a phenomena caused by boundaries of the universe, the ordinary analysis for perturbations is not suitable. One needs to consider perturbations of the future event horizon. For realistic values of parameters it was discovered that perturbations of dark energy don't grow infinitely but vanish or freeze. We also considered the case of realistic interaction between holographic dark energy and matter and showed that in this case perturbations also can asymptotically freeze with time.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16423

 - **Abstract**
 We conduct an all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves using LIGO O3 public data from the Hanford and Livingston detectors. We search for nearly-monochromatic signals with frequencies $30\, \text{Hz} \leq f \leq 250\, \text{Hz}$ and spin-down $-2.7 \times 10^{-9}\, \text{Hz/s} \leq \dot{f} \leq 0.2 \times 10^{-9}\, \text{Hz/s}$. We deploy this search on the Einstein@Home volunteer-computing project and on three super computer clusters; the Atlas supercomputer at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics, and the two high performance computing systems Raven and Viper at the Max Planck Computing and Data Facility. Our results are consistent with a non-detection. We set upper limits on the gravitational wave amplitude $h_{0}$, and translate these to upper limits on the neutron star ellipticity and on the r-mode amplitude. The most stringent upper limits are at 173 Hz with $h_{0} = 6.5\times 10^{-26}$, at the 90% confidence level.

#### ACT-Era Constraints on Single-Field Inflation in $f(T)$ Teleparallel Gravity
 - **Authors:** Feng-Yi Zhang, Rongrong Zhai, Li-Yang Chen
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16530

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16530

 - **Abstract**
 We reassess single-field slow-roll inflation in teleparallel gravity with $f(T)=C\,T^{2\delta+1}$, motivated by recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) that indicate a modest upward shift in the scalar spectral index $n_s$. Using analytic approximations together with high-precision numerical calculations, we compute primordial predictions for representative potentials: power-law monomials, hilltop models, and $E$-type plateaus. We find that torsional corrections controlled by $\delta$ generically suppress $r$ while keeping $n_s$ near its slow-roll value. As a result, modest positive $\delta$ can restore viability to sub-quadratic monomials and hilltop models that are disfavored in general relativity (GR), whereas $E$-type plateaus remain compatible only in a limited range of $\delta$: small $\delta$ may improve the fit but moderate $\delta$ drives the dynamics toward quadratic-like behaviour and increases $r$. These signatures are observationally testable: improved cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode measurements will further discriminate among potential classes and place quantitative bounds on torsional deviations from GR.

#### Energy-momentum response to metric perturbations in the fluid dynamic regime

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16562

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16562

 - **Abstract**
 The interplay of relativistic fluid dynamics and spacetime geometry is discussed in the regime of small wave numbers and frequencies. A combination of gravitational Ward identities and fluid dynamic equations of motion in the Mueller-Israel-Stewart formulation is used to explicitly determine the retarded linear response of the energy-momentum tensor to metric perturbations. We also discuss applications to gravitational wave production and the damping of gravitational waves in a relativistic fluid.
