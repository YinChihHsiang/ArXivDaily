#### On the origin and nature of double-double radio galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Double-double radio galaxies (DDRGs) display inner and outer jets or lobes thought to result from intermittent accretion. Due to randomly triggered accretion events, the lifetime of the retriggered jet is not expected to have any connection to the time of quiescence between jets, yet we show that a correlation between the two quantities may exist, which we interpret as resulting from continued accretion through the quiescent jet phase. Despite continuous accretion, a jet is absent because its presence depends on a non-zero value of black hole spin, but accretion transitions the system from counter-rotation to corotation, and therefore through zero black hole spin where a jet cannot form. The time of jet quiescence depends on how long it takes to spin the black hole up again in corotation, which is longer for lower accretion rates. Once the black hole spin is large enough for a renewed jet, this inner jet will last longer the lower the accretion rate is. Hence, in a continuous accretion scenario, longer quiescent times tend to associate to longer inner jet times. In addition, DDRG jets are of FRII morphology which we show to result from the absence of a tilt in the accretion disk in the transition through zero black hole spin, ensuring the absence of an FRI jet in a way that connects with our understanding of X-shaped radio galaxies. Both correlated timescales as well as sameness in jet morphology offers evidence in favor of our picture.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the impact of heavy dark matter (DM) captured in massive stars via scattering(s) with the star constituents. We focus on the first stars and use stellar evolution simulations to track down how DM capture evolves over time from the zero-age main sequence to the late metal-rich stages of stellar evolution. During the early hydrogen-helium-dominated phase, the capture process is well described by scattering with two targets. As a star evolves, metal production leads to the formation of a dense core surrounded by a lighter envelope. The core significantly enhances the capture of ultra-heavy DM; in this case, three distinct nuclear species are required to accurately describe multiple-scattering capture. We use the Eddington inversion method to obtain a realistic DM velocity distribution, better suited when the star is near the center of a halo, than the widely used Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. We find that heavy DM would be able to thermalize and achieve capture-annihilation equilibrium within a massive star's lifetime for regions of the parameter space not excluded by direct detection. For non-annihilating DM, because of the high amount of targets available for capture and despite massive stars being short-lived, it would even be possible for DM to achieve self-gravitation and collapse to a black hole, which eventually could swallow the star from within before the expected end of the star's life, for non-excluded regions of the parameter space. Our results highlight the dependence of DM capture on the stellar evolutionary stage, composition, and halo location, demonstrating that accurate modeling of massive stars is essential for constraining heavy DM with primordial stellar populations.

#### Primordial black holes within Higgs hybrid metric-Palatini approach

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22924

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) during the radiation-dominated era. The collapse of significant density perturbations originating from large primordial scalar fluctuations generated during inflation can lead to the formation of primordial black holes. In our study, we adopt the Higgs hybrid metric-Palatini model as our framework, in which the inflaton field and the Palatini curvature are non-minimally coupled. To achieve our objective, we analyze the behavior of the primordial curvature power spectrum, which exhibits a large enhancement at small scales corresponding to large wavenumbers $k$. Furthermore, we examine the probability of PBHs formation by studying the mass variance, $\sigma(M_{PBH})$, and the mass fraction of the total energy density collapsing into PBHs, $\beta(M_{PBH})$. The evolution of both functions is consistent with current observational constraints. Finally, we investigate the abundance of primordial black holes as a dark matter candidate. We found that they can account for the totality or a fraction of the current dark matter content, depending primarily on the values of the coupling constant and the e-folds number.

#### A new path to constrain the expansion history of the Universe in future spectroscopic galaxy surveys

 - **Abstract**
 The current tension between early- and late-Universe measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), along with the still elusive nature of dark matter and dark energy, calls for model-independent probes of the Universe's expansion history. The cosmic chronometers (CC) method offers a unique opportunity to directly measure the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ without relying on any cosmological model assumptions or integrated distance measurements. Despite its potential, this technique remains statistics-limited: no current survey is optimized to detect large samples of CC, restricting the precision on $H(z)$ to $\sim$20% at intermediate redshifts. Here, we investigate the opportunities that a next-generation spectroscopic facility could offer to CC studies, providing an estimate of the accuracy achievable on the reconstruction of the Hubble parameter in redshift. We demonstrate that with such a facility, it will be possible to derive constraints on key cosmological parameters, assessing the impact that such improvements would have on our understanding of the expansion history of the Universe and on current cosmological tensions.

#### Interpreting the diversity of afterglow emission from radio-detected tidal disruption events with instantaneous and delayed outflows

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star is gravitationally disrupted by the tidal field of a supermassive black hole during a close encounter. Radio emission has recently been detected in TDEs and is commonly attributed to synchrotron radiation from both wind and jetted outflows. However, several TDEs exhibit bright radio flares at late times, which cannot be easily explained if the wind is launched promptly after the stellar disruption. In this study, we model the radio light curves of TDEs with delayed radio flares using three scenarios: an instantaneous wind, a delayed wind, and a delayed relativistic jet. We show that the instantaneous wind model struggles to reproduce delayed radio flare events, indicating the necessity of an additional delayed outflow component. In contrast, the delayed wind model provides a consistent explanation for the observed radio phenomenology, successfully reproducing events both with and without delayed radio flares. For some delayed radio flare events (e.g., ASASSN-15oi and AT 2019dsg), both the delayed wind and delayed jet models can reproduce the observed radio light curves. The delayed jet model produces x-ray and optical emission that is detectable at typical TDE distances, in contrast to wind-driven scenarios. This highlights how multiwavelength observations offer an effective means of distinguishing among possible outflow mechanisms.

#### Kilonova and progenitor properties of merger-driven gamma-ray bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) prompt and afterglow emission, as well as a kilonova (KN), are the expected electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of Binary Neutron Star (BNS) and Neutron Star -- Black Hole (NSBH) mergers. We aim to infer the KN ejecta parameters and the progenitor properties by modeling merger-driven GRBs with a claim of KN, good data and robust redshift measurement. We model the afterglow and KN, and perform a Bayesian analysis, within the Nuclear physics and Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (NMMA) framework. The KN emission is modeled with the radiative transfer code POSSIS and for afterglow we use the afterglowpy library. In contrast to previous approaches, our methodology simultaneously models both afterglow and KN. We find that all GRBs in our sample have a KN, but we were unable to confirm or exclude its presence in GRB 150101B. A BNS progenitor is favored for GRB 160821B, GRB 170817A/AT2017gfo, GRB 211211A, and GRB 230307A. For GRB 150101B and GRB 191019A, we obtain a slight preference for NSBH scenario, while a BNS is also viable. For KN emission, we find that the median wind mass $\langle M_{\rm wind}\rangle=0.027^{+0.046}_{-0.019}$ $M_{\odot}$ is larger than the dynamical $\langle M_{\rm dyn}\rangle = 0.012^{+0.007}_{-0.006}$ $M_{\odot}$. We find that $M_{\rm wind}$ and the beaming corrected kinetic energy of the jet can be attributed as $log(M_{\rm wind})=-20.23+0.38\,log(E_{0,J})$. We confirm the results of numerical simulation that $\tilde\Lambda$ increases with decrease in $\mathcal{M}_{\rm \,Chirp}$. Our work shows that EM modeling can be effective for probing the progenitors, and for the first time presents the progenitor properties of a sizable sample of merger-driven GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical black holes are invariably embedded in matter environments whose gravitational influence can alter key strong-field features of the spacetime. In this work, we investigate the impact of spherically symmetric dark-matter distributions on black hole geometry, geodesic structure, and ringdown phenomenology. Modeling the surrounding matter through Einstein clusters, we construct self-consistent spacetimes for three widely used density profiles - the Hernquist, Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), and Jaffe models - and examine how their near-horizon behavior modifies the location and stability of circular timelike and null geodesics, including the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and light rings. In the low-compactness regime, we derive analytical expressions showing that environmental effects generically shift the ISCO inward and the principal light ring outward, leading to parametric deviations in their associated orbital frequencies and Lyapunov exponents. At higher compactness, we explore the emergence of additional light rings, marginally stable orbits, and secondary horizons, identifying the regions of parameter space in which these ultracompact configurations arise. Using time-domain evolutions of scalar perturbations, we demonstrate how such structures can imprint characteristic signatures on the ringdown signal, including long-lived trapped modes and echo-like modulations associated with multiple potential barriers. Our results provide a unified framework for assessing environmental effects around black holes and highlight the importance of matter-induced corrections for interpreting upcoming electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 By virtue of harmonic maps on two-dimensional spheres (S$^{2}$), a topological quantization in spacetime is proposed. The discrete character of all physical quantities follows naturally. A Schwarzschild black hole, non-black hole and wormhole based geometries are considered in which a quantum hair becomes effective. A thermometer or curvature-detecting device can record the macroscopic quantumness of spacetime.

#### Scalar-hairy AdS Black Hole in the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar Theory: first-order phase transition with a critical point

 - **Abstract**
 In asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, we consider a real massiver scalar field in the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar (EMS) model and examine both scalar-hairy black hole solutions induced by the nonminimal coupling to the Maxwell field and tachyonic-hairy solutions driven by the scalar potential. When the scalar potential vanishes, scalar-hairy black holes emerge with profiles and properties similar to those observed in flat spacetime. The presence of the scalar potential additionally induces tachyonic-hairy solutions, leading to the coexistence of these two distinct hairy phases in different regions of the parameter space. The phase diagram reveals a first-order phase transition line between the tachyonic-hairy and scalar-hairy phases, originating at a critical point in the extreme temperature and chemical potential regime. Our detailed analysis shows that this phase transition is directly associated with the self-overlap region of the scalar-hairy phase and its start point. Moreover, increasing the coupling strength $\lambda$ shifts the critical point to higher temperature and chemical potential.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we construct new classes of topological black hole solutions in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime using a novel model of nonlinear electrodynamics called Modification Maxwell (ModMax) and Modification phantom or Modification anti-Maxwell (ModAMax). We then evaluate the thermodynamic quantities and verify the first law of thermodynamics. Our study examines how the parameters of the ModMax and ModAMax fields, as well as the topological constant, affect the black hole solutions, thermodynamic quantities, and local and global thermal stabilities. Furthermore, within the framework of extended phase space thermodynamics, we analyze the Joule-Thomson expansion process and determine the inversion curves. This analysis reveals that the ModMax and ModAMax parameters significantly alter the cooling and heating behavior of these AdS black holes, depending on their topology. Finally, by treating these topological Mod(A)Max AdS black holes as heat engines, we assess their efficiencies, demonstrating that the parameters of nonlinear electrodynamics and horizon topology play crucial roles in enhancing or suppressing the system's thermodynamic performance.

 - **Abstract**
 This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the physics of gravitational waves, exploring both the theoretical foundations and the most recent experimental advances. After a general introduction to the theory of general relativity and its major implications, the article discusses the history of gravitational waves, from their prediction by Einstein to their actual detection. It then explains what gravitational waves are and how they interact with appropriate detectors. The main mechanisms of gravitational radiation emission are analyzed, with a focus on compact binary systems of compact objects, whose orbits typically evolve in three phases: inspiral, merger, and the final ringdown phase, each of these phases leaving distinct signatures in the emitted waves. The article highlights the fundamental role of the giant interferometers LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, true cathedrals of modern science, and revisits the historic event GW150914, the first direct detection of gravitational waves, which confirmed the predictions of general relativity and opened a new era for astronomy. This achievement was recognized with the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Other observed events are also discussed, along with their astrophysical sources, and the possibility of detecting gravitational waves of cosmological origin, originating from the Big Bang itself. Finally, current and future projects are analyzed, including observatories based on increasingly sophisticated interferometers, as well as proposals for alternative detection methods, illustrating how gravitational-wave astronomy is shaping the present and future of our exploration of the universe. In concluding, the detection of gravitational waves is set in a broader context by examining the discoveries across the electromagnetic spectrum, thereby illustrating the complementary perspectives these different observational channels provide.

#### Solving the constraint equation for general free data

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the problem of solving the Einstein constraint equations in vacuum by a new method, which allows us to prescribe four scalar quantities, representing the full dynamical degrees of freedom of the constraint system. We show that once appropriate gauge conditions have been chosen and four scalars freely specified (modulo $\ell\leq 1$ modes), we can rewrite the constraint equations as a well-posed system of coupled transport and elliptic equations on $2$-spheres, which we solve by an iteration procedure. Our method provides a large class of exterior solutions of the constraint equations that can be matched to given interior solutions, according to the existing gluing techniques. As such, it can be applied to provide a large class of initial Cauchy data sets evolving to black holes, generalizing the well-known result of the formation of trapped surfaces due to Li and Yu. Though in our main theorem, we only specify conditions consistent with $g-g_{Schw}=O(r^{-1-\delta})$, $k=O(r^{-2-\delta})$, the method is flexible enough to be applied in many other situations. It can, in particular, be easily adapted to construct arbitrarily fast decaying data. We expect, moreover, that our method can also be applied to construct data with slower decay, such as that used by Shen. In fact, an important motivation for developing our method is to show that the result of Shen is sharp, i.e., construct small, smooth initial data sets which violate Shen's decay conditions, and for which the stability of the Minkowski space result is wrong.

#### Probing higher curvature gravity via ringdown with overtones

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22728

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate metric perturbations of a spherically symmetric black hole in higher curvature gravity. We show that higher curvature corrections deform the near-horizon region of the effective potential, and that the deviations of the quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies from their general relativity (GR) values become more pronounced for overtone modes. We find that, as the order of the higher curvature term increases, the deformations approach the horizon and the deviations of the overtone QNM frequencies grow progressively larger. We also analyze the ringdown waveforms in the higher curvature gravity model. We consider setups in which the deviations from the vacuum-GR QNMs remain mild for the fundamental mode and the first few overtones, and show that these shifted QNMs can be identified in the ringdown signal through waveform fitting.

#### Constraining the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity with future gravitational wave detectors

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, a parity-violating modification of general relativity, is regarded as a low-energy effective theory arising from string theory. Gravitational waves provide a powerful probe for testing its predictions. However, current gravitational wave observations are unable to place meaningful constraints on this theory through phase measurements, due to limitations from detector noise and the validity requirements of the waveform models. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the prospects for constraining the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity with future gravitational-wave detectors using stellar mass black holes binary. We quantify how the constraining capacities vary across different detectors and source parameters, and identify the regions of parameter space that satisfy the small-coupling condition. Furthermore, by incorporating an astrophysically motivated mass distribution model for stellar mass black hole binaries, we estimate the potential of upcoming observatories.

#### Polarized image of an equatorial emitting ring around a Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black hole

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22764

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the polarized images of an equatorial emitting ring around a Konoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr black hole, which introduces an additional deformation parameter. The deformation parameter $\eta$ allows the spin parameter to extend beyond the bounds imposed by the standard Kerr black hole. The results indicate that the polarized images depend not only on the magnetic field configuration, fluid velocity, and observer inclination angle, but also on the deformation parameter and the spin parameter. As the deformation parameter increases, the polarization intensity decreases monotonically when the magnetic field lies in the equatorial plane, whereas it does not vary monotonically when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the equatorial plane. The variation of the electric vector position angle with the deformation parameter is complex. For a fixed deformation parameter, the polarization intensity exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the spin parameter and varies with azimuthal angle. We also investigate the impact of the deformation parameter on the Stokes Q-U loops. The imprint of the deformation parameter in polarized images may serve as a high-precision observational probe for detecting deviations of black hole spacetime from the Kerr geometry and testing general relativity.

#### Topological Complex Analysis of Kerr--Newman Black Hole Microstructure in f(R) Gravity

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22853

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the microstructure of Kerr Newman black holes in modified gravity of the f(R) type using a topological complex analytic framework inspired by holography. In this approach, black hole microstates are identified with singularities of an analytically continued partition function, and the entropy is obtained from residues weighted by winding numbers. We show that the microstructure is characterized by a discrete topological index, which encodes both horizon structure and thermodynamic stability. Non extremal Kerr Newman black holes with both inner and outer horizons correspond to a vanishing topological index, while single horizon configurations correspond to a positive unit topological index. An explicit Starobinsky type modified gravity model demonstrates that this classification is robust under changes to the gravitational sector. We further discuss the limitations of the analytic continuation procedure and suggest that this topological classification may indicate a form of phase protection in black hole thermodynamics.

#### Scalar-Field Wave Dynamics and Quasinormal Modes of the Teo Rotating Wormhole

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23104

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze scalar field perturbations of the rotating Teo wormhole and compute its quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum using WKB methods in a fully horizonless geometry. The Klein Gordon equation separates and yields a Schrödinger type radial equation with a single, smooth potential barrier shaped by the localized frame dragging profile of the wormhole throat. This barrier supports damped oscillatory modes across the full spin range examined. The resulting QNM spectrum exhibits a coherent and monotonic dependence on rotation. As the spin increases, both the oscillation frequency and the damping rate decrease, indicating progressively longer-lived modes in the absence of horizon induced absorption. In the eikonal limit, we extract the photon-ring radius, orbital frequency, and Lyapunov exponent, and verify the standard QNM-Eikonal correspondence. Comparison with Kerr black holes reveals qualitative differences. Whereas Kerr QNMs are governed by horizon absorption and exhibit symmetric prograde/retrograde mode splitting, the Teo wormhole displays a stronger but spatially confined spin response, partial reflection at the throat, and a distinctive one-sided splitting that saturates rapidly with increasing spin. Although the rotating Teo wormhole admits an ergoregion and superradiant compatible frequency kinematics, the absence of an event horizon or dissipative boundary prevents classical superradiant amplification. These results demonstrate how rotation and boundary conditions jointly shape wave propagation in horizonless compact objects and provide characteristic spectral signatures distinguishing rotating wormholes from Kerr black holes.

#### Lense-Thirring Acoustic Black Holes : Shadows and Light

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23113

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the Lense-Thirring Acoustic Black Hole (LTABH), motivated by the relevance of analogue models for black holes embedded in various physical systems, such as the cosmological microwave background or quantum superfluids. We investigate the LTABH spacetime geometry, showing that the roots of the metric function determine a partition of the spacetime into four regions, depending on the acoustic parameter $\xi $ (whereas the dependence vanishes for the rotation parameter $a$); on the other hand, the parameter $a$ turns out to affect the critical radii associated to the maxima of the effective potential. All in all, both the acoustic sphere radius $r_{as}$ and the photon sphere radius $r_{ps}$, respectively giving rise to the acoustic shadow $R_{as}$ and to the optical shadow $R_{s}$, depend on $\xi $ and $a$. More precisely, the rotation parameter $a$ is more relevantly affecting $R_{s}$ (through a right shift), while $R_{as}$ retains its circular shape. For what concerns the acoustic parameter, we notice that the higher $\xi $ is, the larger the size of both shadows. All of these results are confirmed through a detailed analysis of the distortions and of the shadows radii. Moreover, by deriving the magnitude of the precession frequency $\Omega $, we observe that it significantly increases near the acoustic horizons, both in the extremal and in the non-extremal cases, which implies that the Lense-Thirring (frame dragging) effect, which can be traced back to $\xi $ itself, becomes important near such regions. On the other hand, we also show that there are regions of the LTABH spacetime in which $% \Omega $ vanishes, suggesting that therein possible probe particles would not be affected by the frame dragging at all. Finally, we derive the deflection of the light near the LTABH.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultralight bosons are compelling dark-matter candidates. Both scalar and vector bosons can be produced through black hole superradiance, forming a boson cloud surrounding a rotating black hole. Self-interaction of bosons, together with transition mixing in binary black hole systems, give rise to dynamical phenomena that could be potentially observable with future gravitational wave observations. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of bosons in binary black hole systems. In particular, we focus on boson mass transfer in unequal-mass binary black hole systems with arbitrary spin-orientation of the companion. Our results show that the mass ratio between the companion and the primary black holes significantly affects cloud absorption through mass transfer. Moreover, when the companion's spin is not aligned with that of the primary, the efficiency of cloud depletion is further modified.

 - **Abstract**
 In the Newtonian limit of $f(R)$ gravity, for an isolated self-gravitating system consisting of $N$ extended fluid bodies, the inter-body dynamics are studied by applying the symmetric and trace-free formalism in terms of irreducible Cartesian tensors. The multipole expansion of each body's center-of-mass acceleration is derived, and the expansion comprises the Coulomb-type part and the Yukawa-type part, where the former, identical to that in General Relativity, is encoded by the products of the mass multipole moments of the body with those of other bodies, and the latter, as the modification introduced by $f(R)$ gravity, is encoded by the products of the scalar multipole moments of the body with those of other bodies. As an essential component of the system's orbital dynamics, the multipole expansion for the total gravitational potential energy is provided, and the expression for the total conserved energy in terms of the mass and scalar multipole moments of the bodies is offered. To investigate the system's spin dynamics, the equation of motion for each body's spin angular momentum is further deduced and presented in the form of multipole expansion. These findings constitute the main content of the coarse-grained description of inter-body dynamics for the system within the framework of the Newtonian limit of $f(R)$ gravity. As a by-product, for a two-body system, the effective one-body equation governing the relative motion between the two bodies and the total energy of this system are achieved.

 - **Abstract**
 We establish a quasinormal-mode/grey-body factor correspondence for Kerr black holes in the eikonal limit. By recasting the radial Teukolsky equation into a Schrödinger-type form with a short-range potential, we derive WKB connection formulas that relate Kerr quasinormal frequencies to grey-body transmission coefficients. Higher-order WKB corrections are included, extending the correspondence beyond the leading eikonal regime. For gravitational perturbations, the predicted grey-body factors agree with numerical results obtained from the generalized Sasaki-Nakamura equation, with increasing accuracy at large angular quantum number. The correspondence breaks down in the superradiant regime, where the WKB assumptions fail.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the structure and properties of neutron stars in four-dimensional non-polynomial gravities. Solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for three different equations of state (BSk19, SLy4, AP4), we confirm that neutron star solutions remain in existence. As the modification parameter $\alpha$ increases, neutron stars grow in both radius and mass. We find that, when the parameter $\alpha$ is sufficiently large, a frozen state emerges at the end of the neutron-star sequence. In this state, the metric functions approach zero extremely close to the stellar surface, forming a critical horizon, making it nearly indistinguishable from a black hole to an external observer. Such a frozen neutron star constitutes a universal endpoint of the neutron-star sequence in this theory, independent of the choice of the equation of state. Based on our results and current observational constraints, we derive bounds on the modification parameter $\alpha$ and show that frozen neutron stars remain allowed in the bounds.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes beyond General Relativity may carry non-standard charges that impact their phenomenology. We study how the scalar charge that is induced by the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling is affected by the presence of a nontrivial kinetic term $K(X)$. We discuss the corresponding kinetic screening in the asymptotically flat, static solution first. We then turn to the case where self-accelerating cosmology is driven by $K(X)$, finding that the time-dependence of the scalar field opens up the parameter space, turning the black-hole scalar charge from secondary to primary. We provide a stability analysis and a measure of the intensity of the kinetic screening from the quartic dispersion relation of the mixed scalar and gravitational modes.

 - **Abstract**
 We implement a probe counterpart of Newman-Janis algorithm, which Wick rotates the all-orders geodesic deviation equation into a part of exact spinning-particle equations of motion. Consequently, the gravitational dynamics of the Kerr black hole in its point-particle effective theory is completely constrained in the self-dual sector for a hidden symmetry, implying the spin exponentiation of same-helicity gravitational Compton amplitudes to all multiplicities.

 - **Abstract**
 Minimal 5-dimensional supergravity compactified on a circle gives the T$^{3}$ model of $\mathcal{N}=2,d=4$ supergravity, whose duality group is SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$. We study exhaustively the relations between all the local and global symmetries of both theories and between the corresponding conserved currents and charges, including the on-shell closed generalized Komar charges associated to isometries. We find that the 2-dimensional subgroup of SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$ that does not include electric-magnetic transformations is realized as a higher-form symmetry group that acts on the 5-dimensional metric and vector field. Using the generalized Komar charges we compute the Smarr formulas for black holes, showing that they are identical once the relations between all the 5- and 4-dimensional thermodynamical quantities are taken into account, which is only possible if certain constraints on the fields are satisfied. We notice that on-shell closed 5-dimensional 3-form charges give, upon dimensional reduction, on-shell closed 3-form currents and 2-form charges. The dimensional reduction of the 5-dimensional generalized Komar 3-form charge associated to a Killing vector gives a new 4-dimensional on-shell closed 3-form current which must be associated to a new global symmetry of the theory when it admits that Killing vector. Some of the results that we have derived are valid for theories of Einstein--Maxwell-like theories of $(p+1)$-forms with Chern--Simons terms, which includes 11-dimensional supergravity as a particular example.

 - **Abstract**
 We present all bosonic giant and dual-giant type configurations of a probe D3-brane in the BPS single-parameter Gutowski-Reall black hole in 10d type IIB supergravity that do not break any of its supersymmetries. The resulting D3-brane world-volumes can be given by the common zeros of three holomorphic functions of five complex scalar harmonics of the geometry. These probe branes support world-volume electromagnetic fields which we characterise completely in terms of pull-backs of closed 2-forms. Our configurations can be seen as natural generalisations of known supersymmetric D3-branes in $AdS_5 \times S^5$ and approach them far away from the black hole horizon.

 - **Abstract**
 In this thesis, we derive the equations of motion of Chiral Higher Spin Gravity (HiSGRA) in terms of its underlying $L_\infty$-algebra. Chiral HiSGRA contains self-dual Yang-Mills and self-dual gravity as closed subsectors, which themselves form closed subsectors of Yang-Mills and general relativity. We begin by constructing a covariant formulation for self-dual Yang-Mills and self-dual gravity, and subsequently extend this construction to the full Chiral Higher Spin Gravity. Remarkably, the $L_\infty$-algebra is constructed from an $A_\infty$-algebra of pre-Calabi-Yau type, suggesting a deep connection to non-commutative deformation quantization. The structure maps of the resulting $L_\infty$-algebra are expressed as integrals of a simple exponential over convex polygons in $\mathbb{R}^2$. The existence of this covariant and coordinate independent formulation of chiral HiSGRA demonstrates, via the AdS/CFT correspondence, that $O(N)$ vector models possess a closed chiral subsector. Finally, we prove that the $A_\infty$-algebra follows from Stokes' theorem -- a crucial feature of the known formality theorems. To this end, we construct integration spaces that generalize convex polygons to $\mathbb{R}^3$, and are intimately connected to positive Grassmanians. This Stokes-based derivation points towards a novel generalization of Kontsevich' formality theorem to the non-commutative setting.

 - **Abstract**
 Chaotic motion near black holes has recently been examined through the lens of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) chaos-bound, but reported violations remain contradictory. A major source of this ambiguity lies in the common practice of treating the angular momentum of test particles as a freely adjustable parameter, rather than a quantity fixed by the circular-orbit conditions. In this work, we develop a fully constrained framework in which the angular momentum of particles is determined exactly from the underlying geometry and is used consistently in both the orbital and Lyapunov analyses. For the charged Kiselev black hole, previously reported chaos-bound violations disappear under a consistent treatment of angular momentum, indicating that these effects are apparent rather than physical. This inference is reinforced by the exact agreement between our results and the standard circular-orbit condition obtained from the effective-potential approach. By extending the analysis to geometries containing higher-order curvature terms, we find genuine chaos-bound violations at large charge-to-mass ratios, originating from curvature corrections rather than orbital parameters. This framework, therefore, provides a systematic means of distinguishing apparent from physical chaos-bound violations in Einstein gravity and its extensions.

 - **Abstract**
 We report on the presence of families of exact solutions for a complex scalar field that behaves according to the rules of discrete $Z_N$ symmetry. Since the family of models is exactly solved, the results appear to be of interest to integrability, to build junctions and networks of localized structures and to describe scalar dark matter in high energy physics.

 - **Abstract**
 We re-examine the problem of vacuum decay in the presence of spherically symmetric black holes. Within the semiclassical approximation, we study configurations describing a bubble of true vacuum propagating outside a black hole formed from gravitational collapse. We find that the saddle point is dominated by a single energy state and that the dependence on the initial conditions in the stellar interior vanishes exponentially fast at late stages of the collapse. Prescriptions are given for implementing the corresponding boundary conditions in the eternal black-hole geometry. We find that vacuum decay can only be weakly catalyzed by the black hole, as the suppression exponent attains a minimum at a finite black-hole mass. In the limit of vanishing black-hole mass, the suppression smoothly approaches the flat-space result.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute static ($\omega\to0$) tilde Love numbers for scalar ($s=0$) and Dirac ($s=1/2$) perturbations of static acoustic black holes (ABHs) in (3+1) and (2+1) dimensions respectively. By imposing horizon regularity condition and matching to the large-radius expansion, we extract the ratio between decaying and growing modes. It turns out that in (3+1) dimensions the scalar Love number is generically nonzero for ABHs, while the Fermionic Love numbers follow a universal power-law form $F^{\pm1/2}_{\ell m}=\pm 4^{-(\ell+1/2)}$. In (2+1) dimensions the scalar field exhibits a strange logarithmic structure, causing the Bosonic Love number to vanish for even $m$ but remain nontrivial for odd $m$; In contrast, the Fermionic Love number in this case retains a simple power-law form $F_m=4^{-m}$ and is generically nonzero. These results provide insights into tidal response in analogue gravity systems and highlight qualitative differences between integer- and half-integer-spin fields.

 - **Abstract**
 We define a black hole state in a spin chain by studying thermal correlators in holography. Focusing on the Heisenberg model we investigate the thermal and complexity properties of the black hole state by evaluating its entanglement entropy, emptiness formation probability and Krylov complexity. The entanglement entropy grows logarithmically with effective central charge c=5.2. We find evidence for thermalization at infinite temperature.

#### Two roads to fortuity in ABJM theory

 - **Abstract**
 A recently proposed addition to the holographic dictionary connects extremal black holes to fortuitous operators -- those which are only supersymmetric for sufficiently small values of the central charge. The most efficient techniques for finding them come from studying the cohomology of a nilpotent supercharge. We explore two aspects of this problem in weakly-coupled ABJM theory, where the gauge group is $\mathrm{U}(N) \times \mathrm{U}(N)$ and the Chern-Simons level is taken to be large. Adapting an algorithm which has been used to great effect in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills, we enumerate 244 low-lying fortuitous operators and sort them into multiplets of the centralizer algebra. This leads to the construction of two leading fortuitous representatives for $N = 3$ which are subleading for $N = 2$. In the second part of this work, we identify a truncation of ABJM theory where the action of the one-loop supercharge matches the one in the BMN subsector of $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills. This allows a known infinite tower of representatives to be lifted from one theory to the other.

 - **Abstract**
 This is a combined review on the Kerr/CFT correspondence on the one hand and solvable irrelevant deformations of two-dimensional QFTs - specifically, the $T\bar T$ and $J\bar T$ deformations - on the other. These subjects are interconnected, since the microscopic description of general black holes can be linked to very special irrelevant deformations of two-dimensional CFTs; conversely, one may draw interesting insights into black hole microscopics from the study of the exactly solvable $T\bar T$ and $J\bar T$ deformations. The Kerr/CFT part emphasizes the conceptual challenges faced by this proposed holographic description of general extremal black holes, especially in light of recent advances indicating that the classical geometry of extremal black holes is unreliable. The review of the $T\bar T$ and $J\bar T$ deformations is self-contained and presented from a purely field-theoretical perspective. It covers core topics such as the finite-size spectrum, thermodynamics, scattering, non-perturbative definition and the holographic dictionary for these deformations. Particular emphasis is placed upon the extended symmetries of $T\bar T$ and $J\bar T$ - deformed CFTs, including the perfect match between the symmetries derived via field-theoretic methods and the asymptotic symmetries of the dual spacetimes. These symmetries are also central to understanding the precise relationship between single-trace $T\bar T$ and $J\bar T$ - deformed CFTs and three-dimensional asymptotically linear dilaton and, respectively, warped AdS backgrounds.

 - **Abstract**
 We give an explicit closed form description of the late-time near-horizon approach to dynamical extreme Reissner-Nordstrom (DERN) black holes. These are spherically symmetric dynamical solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to a neutral scalar that feature: (i) a spacetime metric which tends to that of a static extreme Reissner-Nordstrom (RN), and (ii) a scalar field which displays the linear Aretakis instability ad infinitum in the non-linear theory. We employ the two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity to solve explicitly for the non-linear s-wave dynamics of the four-dimensional theory near an ${\rm AdS}_2\times {\rm S}^2$ throat. For a teleologically defined black hole horizon, we impose boundary conditions on JT's dilaton field (which encodes the gravitational dynamics) and the scalar matter as follows: (i) the JT dilaton decays at late times on the ${\rm AdS}_2$ boundary to a value that corresponds to a static extreme RN in the exterior, and (ii) the scalar obeys boundary conditions characteristic of linear Aretakis behavior on ${\rm AdS}_2$. We ensure our DERN solutions are singularity-free and we note that our approach to DERN is accompanied by a final burst of outgoing scalar matter flux leaking out of the ${\rm AdS}_2$ throat. The boundary conditions we impose on the JT dilaton place its late-time boundary profile on the threshold of black hole formation with sub-extreme and super-extreme RN on either side of our DERNs.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute the complete potential-graviton contributions to the conservative radial action and scattering angle for two non-spinning bodies in general relativity, accurate through fifth order in Newton's constant and including second-order self-force (2SF) effects. The calculation is carried out in the scattering-amplitude framework, combining the double copy, effective field theory, and multi-loop integration techniques based on integration by parts and differential equations. To address a major computational bottleneck, we develop improved integration-by-parts algorithms that render calculations at this order tractable. The amplitude is presented as a series expansion, following the strategy used earlier in maximal supergravity. For the first self-force sector, which involves only polylogarithmic functions, we also provide a closed-form analytic expression. For the second self-force sector, as in earlier supergravity work, we find nontrivial cancellations among contributions related to integrals supported on Calabi-Yau geometry.
