#### Disentangling the Origins of the NANOGrav Signal: Early Universe Models and $ΔN_{eff}$ Bounds

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA) spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $>3.5\sigma$ detection by the Simons Observatory.

#### Interaction of polytropic dark energy in cosmological model: Constraints from observational data

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate an interacting polytropic dark energy (PDE) model characterised by the equation of state $p_{d} = \alpha \rho_{d}^{\,1+\frac{1}{\beta}}$, where the interaction between dark energy and pressureless matter is modelled via a linear coupling term $Q = 3\eta H\rho_{d}$. The background dynamics are formulated by deriving the Hubble parameter in the interacting scenario, and the model parameters are constrained through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using three joint observational data sets: Hubble77+BAO26, Hubble77+Pantheon$^+$, and Hubble77+BAO26+DESI DR2. The resulting best-fit values of $(H_0, \Omega_{d0}, \eta) $ are $(69.22^{+1.27}_{-1.24},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,-0.22^{+0.10}_{-0.12})$, $(69.23^{+1.27}_{-1.22},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,-0.34^{+0.15}_{-0.17})$, and $(67.77^{+1.26}_{-1.24},\,0.73^{+0.02}_{-0.02},\,\\-0.02^{+0.10}_{-0.11})$ respectively for the respective data combinations. Our results indicate a positive energy density and negative pressure over the full redshift range, with the evolution of the equation-of-state parameter and state finder parameters placing the model firmly within the Quintessence regime. The study of the deceleration parameter also reveals a shift from a decelerating to an accelerating cosmic expansion. The estimated present age of the Universe is $14\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, consistent with recent observational data. Furthermore, the sign of $Q$ implies a current energy transfer from dark energy to matter. These findings support the interacting PDE framework as a viable candidate for explaining late-time cosmic acceleration and related large-scale dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary black hole (BBH) mergers,, an important source of gravitational-waves(GWs), are assumed to be hosted in galaxies. The probability of a galaxy to host a BBH is related to its properties, for example stellar mass and star formation rate. These properties can be estimated from observables, such as the luminosity in certain observation bands. We refer to this description of host galaxy properties as host galaxy weighting models. However, the host galaxy weighting model for BBHs has yet to be accurately determined. Population synthesis has provided a variety of host galaxy weighting models. Here we investigate whether it is possible to distinguish different host galaxy weighting models using a data driven approach. We use the GW cosmology tool gwcosmo with a simulated IGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) fifth observing run (O5)-like observing scenario. We also construct a mock spectroscopic galaxy catalogue from MICECATv2. Our analysis compares the Bayes factors among three simple luminosity weighting models, r-band, g-band, and uniform weighting. The Bayes factors among different host galaxy weighting models show a minor preference for the true model for a ~200-detection case, and a decisive preference for the true model over the uniform model for a ~1000-detection case, which is strongly driven by a small number of well-localised events.

#### Infrared Extended Uncertainty Principle Corrections and Quintessence-Induced Topology of Reissner-Nordström AdS Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 We present a unified topological and geometric analysis of charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes immersed in a quintessence field, incorporating infrared gravitational corrections arising from the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP). The latter modifies the standard Heisenberg uncertainty relation by introducing a minimal momentum/maximal length scale, which effectively captures long-wavelength quantum gravitational effects relevant to black hole thermodynamics in curved spacetimes. We derive analytic expressions for the corrected Hawking temperature, entropy and heat capacity in terms of the EUP deformation parameter. Furthermore, the inclusion of quintessence, characterized by barotropic indices \(\omega_q = -\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\omega_q = -\frac{1}{3}\), modifies the black hole metric function. By studying the relaxation-time function $\tau(r_h)$, we identify a number of inflection points that depends sensitively on the equation of state parameter of quintessence, indicating a nontrivial impact of the latter on the black hole phase structure. Applying Duan's topological current method to the off-shell free energy, we compute integer-valued winding numbers associated with each thermodynamic critical point. A parallel topological analysis of the photon sphere assigns charges \( \pm 1 \) to individual light rings, showing that quintessence effects can trigger the splitting or merging of photon spheres, while preserving the total exterior topological charge of $-1$.

#### The non-orientable spacetime of the eternal black hole

 - **Abstract**
 We derive the metric of the BTZ black hole for the special case of interchanging the characteristics of space and time coordinates. We maximally extend the geometry of this interior solution and show that the line element is similar to its exterior solution counterpart. Thus, we assign the thermofield double state dual to this interior geometric construction. As a result, we have two independent thermofield double states corresponding to the BTZ metric: one dual to the exterior solution and one dual to the interior solution. In this scenario, considering both thermofield double states as dual to the full BTZ black hole, we evaluate the partition function of the bulk. The partition function represents a non-orientable spacetime. Additionally, we derive a thermofield double-like state that connects in the gravity dual the regions of spacetime with opposite orientations of space and time.

#### Semi-analytical Study on the Polarized Images of Black Hole due to Frame Dragging

 - **Abstract**
 An initially retrograde accretion flow is transformed into a prograde configuration before plunging into the black hole, as a result of the frame-dragging effect induced by the black hole's rotation. The polarized image of a black hole shaped by such an accretion flow manifests three distinctive critical locations: the turning point of the flow's primary image, the polarization-flip location on the image plane, and the position of the primary image corresponding to the flow's actual turning point in spacetime. Due to the influences of gravitational lensing and gravitational Faraday rotation, these three positions generally do not coincide. In this work, we examine a thin equatorial accretion disk composed of initially retrograde, geodesically moving flows, and conduct a systematic investigation into the interrelations and discrepancies among these critical locations. We elucidate the spatial hierarchy among the three, and for an on-axis observer, we derive approximate analytic expressions characterizing their positions.

#### Binary black hole population inference combining confident and marginal events from the $\tt{IAS\text{-}HM}$ search pipeline

 - **Abstract**
 We present the population properties of binary black hole mergers identified by the $\tt{IAS\text{-}HM}$ pipeline (which incorporates higher-order modes in the search templates) during the third observing run (O3) of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) detectors. In our population inference analysis, instead of only using events above a sharp cut based on a particular detection threshold (e.g., false alarm rate), we use a Bayesian framework to consistently include both marginal and confident events. We find that our inference based solely on highly significant events ($p_{\mathrm{astro}} \sim 1$) is broadly consistent with the GWTC-3 population analysis performed by the LVK collaboration. However, incorporating marginal events into the analysis leads to a preference for stronger redshift evolution in the merger rate and an increased density of asymmetric mass-ratio mergers relative to the GWTC-3 analysis, while remaining within its allowed parameter ranges. Using simple parametric models to describe the binary black hole population, we estimate a merger rate density of $32.4^{+18.5}_{-12.2}\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at redshift $z = 0.2$, and a redshift evolution parameter of $\kappa = 4.4^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$. Assuming a power-law form for the mass ratio distribution ($\propto q^{\beta}$), we infer $\beta = 0.1^{+1.9}_{-1.4}$, indicating a relatively flat distribution. These results highlight the potential impact of marginal events on population inferences and motivate future analyses with data from upcoming observing runs.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the quantum correction on thermodynamics of the Reissner-Nordström black hole in the presence of the quintessence matter associated with dark energy. To this end, the modified Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and entropy functions of the black hole are derived. { Investigation reveals that the modified uncertainty principles and normalization factor $\alpha$ restrict the lower bound value of horizon radius to affect the Hawking temperature and the parameter $\eta_{0}$ have a non-negligible effect on the heat capacity threshold.} {Furthermore}, the correction of entropy does not depend on the quintessence matter. It is also examined the equation of state associated with the pressure and the volume in this framework. In addition, we employ graphical methods to compare and discuss the findings within the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) and extended uncertainty principle (EUP).

 - **Abstract**
 Recent research has revealed a novel nonlinear mechanism, distinct from the linear superradiant instability, which triggers the black hole bomb phenomenon. Introducing a massive complex scalar field with nonlinear self-interactions drives the Reissner-Nordström black hole to shed substantial energy, thereby triggering a black hole bomb. Radial oscillations in the scalar hair profile are observed during this process. In this paper, we further reveal that physical quantities associated with scalar hair exhibit identical oscillation patterns during the evolution of the black hole-scalar field system. Moreover, the oscillation frequency exhibits a linear dependence on the gauge coupling constant of the scalar field with other parameters fixed. Meanwhile, the horizon radius of hairy black holes and the mass within the horizon increase monotonically with the gauge coupling constant. We have also identified a critical initial charge value that distinguishes hairy solutions that trigger black hole bombs from those that do not.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze quasi-periodic oscillation data from selected X-ray binary systems hosting black holes. To model the spacetime geometry, we resort the static Sen solution -- originally derived in the framework of heterotic string theory -- which reduces to the Schwarzschild spacetime for vanishing electric charge. By fitting the observed frequencies within the relativistic precession model, we constrain the mass and charge parameters of the Sen black hole and discuss their astrophysical implications, particularly in distinguishing classical black holes from their string-inspired counterparts.

 - **Abstract**
 As Einstein's gravity is a non-renormalizable theory, it can be a good description of physics only at the scales of energy or spacetime curvature below the Planck mass. Moreover, it requires the presence of an infinite tower of higher-derivative corrections, as required in the framework of effective field theory (EFT). Black holes, known to be vacuum solutions in Einstein's gravity, necessarily have singularities in the center, where both Einstein's gravity and low-energy EFT expansions break down. In this work, we address the question of whether, in the presence of matter, regular solutions looking like black holes from outside do exist. We show that the matter distribution supporting the regular black hole solution in the presence of Riemann tensor cube and Riemann tensor to the fourth power EFT corrections satisfies positivity of energy (also called weak energy condition, WEC) and null energy condition (NEC) everywhere outside the horizon. Unlike the case of singular solutions, the EFT description is also valid in the interior of such an object, given that the maximal curvature is bounded and does not exceed the cut-off scale. We found that in a wide range of parameters, WEC is satisfied inside the horizon, but NEC is violated inside the horizon in all cases.

#### Spin versus Magic: Lessons from Gluon and Graviton Scattering

 - **Abstract**
 The quantum property of non-stabiliserness, also known as magic, plays a key role in designing quantum computing systems. How to produce, manipulate and enhance magic remains mysterious, such that concrete examples of physical systems that manifest magic behaviour are sought after. In this paper, we study two-particle scattering of gluons and gravitons in Yang--Mills theory and General Relativity, as well as their supersymmetric extensions. This provides an interesting case of two-qubit systems, differing only in the physical spin of the qubits. We show that magic is generically produced in both theories, and also show that magic typically decreases as the spin of the qubits increases. The maximal magic in each case is found to be substantially less than the known upper bound. Differences in the profile of magic generation can be traced to the known physics of each theory, as manifested in relations between their respective scattering amplitudes. Our case study may provide useful insights into understanding magic in other systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Consistency constraints for low-energy theories, especially those lacking Lorentz invariance, have recently garnered attention. Building on results from black hole thermodynamics, we investigate the conjecture that leading irrelevant deformations of a conformal field theory in the infrared must increase the system's entropy. We show that this entropy-positivity conjecture is equivalent to a decrease in the thermal grand potential at a fixed temperature. We then evaluate this proposal against various known positivity bounds and other physical constraints on effective theories: for $U(1)$ Goldstone bosons with a quartic self-interaction at (non-)zero chemical potential, for the Euler-Heisenberg model, for the $O(N)$ nonlinear sigma model in $(2+1)D$, and for $T\bar{T}$ deformations of the 2D Ising CFT. We find broad agreement with the entropy-positivity conjecture, and we discuss test cases where the conjecture cannot be applied.

#### Cosmological pole-skipping, shock waves and quantum chaotic dynamics of de Sitter horizons

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic analysis of pole-skipping for scalar, Maxwell, and gravitational waves in cosmological spacetimes. Specifically, working in empty de Sitter space and in Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole geometries, we locate the tower of pole-skipping points of such fields and show that they impose nontrivial constraints on the corresponding bulk two-point functions. Focusing on the gravitational sound channel, we then extract the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocities that characterize hypothetical dual many-body quantum chaos at each horizon. These chaotic data precisely match the outcome of a gravitational shock wave calculation, confirming that the relevant pole-skipping points encode high-energy scattering of horizon quanta. Interestingly, the butterfly velocities can become superluminal or imaginary, with the latter signaling a spatially modulated propagation of chaos. Assuming that a holographic dual exists, we translate our results into field theory language and propose that the dual theory can be divided into two entangled sectors that capture the black hole and cosmological horizon degrees of freedom. Our results suggest that the black hole sector becomes increasingly nonlocal as the black hole shrinks and that the cosmological horizon sector exhibits behavior compatible with violations of Hermiticity. Finally, we outline simple microscopic toy models, built from long-range and non-Hermitian deformations of the Double Scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK)-type chains, that realize these features, providing a concrete arena for future exploration.
