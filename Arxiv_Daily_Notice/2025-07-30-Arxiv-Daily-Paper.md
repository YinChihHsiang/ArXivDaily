 In arXiv:2505.18900 it was claimed that an apparent evolution of the dark energy equation of state occurs within the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. I point out that this erroneous conclusion is due to a mathematical error.

 - **Abstract**
 The standard approach to searching for gravitational wave signatures in pulsar timing array (PTA) data has been to compare the theoretical Hellings and Downs (HD) curve with the observed correlations in pulsar timing residuals as a function of angular separation on the sky between pulsar pairs. While this approach has successfully produced evidence for the presence of nanohertz-wavelength gravitational waves, it does not, on its own, produce any directional information. It is also insensitive to the polarization of the gravitational waves. An alternative approach is to construct maps of the gravitational wave distribution on the sky. In this paper, we present a simple quadratic estimator of the gravitational wave power as a function of direction on the sky that is sensitive to the polarization state of the wave. In this way, we describe the full, $S_2 \times S_2$, state-space of a polarized gravitational wave background across the sky and the Poincaré sphere describing polarization. A natural question arises from this perspective: what is the resolution of a polarized sky-map, i.e. effectively how many independent pixels can a such a map contain? In other words, how many distinct gravitational waves can a PTA, in principle, distinguish? It turns out the answer is finite, and is approximately $N_{\rm res} = 16 \times 2 = 32$, where 16 is the number of resolvable sky-positions and 2 is the number of distinct polarization states. This corresponds to an angular resolution of $58^\circ$, which can be achieved by a PTA with more than $N_{\rm pulsar} \gtrsim 20$ pulsars. We demonstrate that the variance of the map is equivalent to the HD significance, while for a single point source, a 3-$\sigma$ HD signal corresponds to a 5.2-$\sigma$ map significance.

 - **Abstract**
 It has remained challenging to reliably identify sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), despite them being expected to be ubiquitous. We propose a new method using multi-band continuum reverberation mapping to identify low-mass-ratio SMBHBs in active galactic nuclei. The basic principle is that, due to the presence of a low-density cavity between the mini-disks and the circumbinary disk, the continuum emissions show a deficit at certain wavelengths, leading to a distinguishing feature in the relation between the inter-band time lag and wavelengths $\tau(\lambda)$. Specifically, the relation appears flat at short wavelengths because of the truncated sizes of the mini-disks and transits to a power law $\lambda^{4/3}$ at long wavelength stemming from the circumbinary disk. This transition feature is distinct from the uniform relation $\lambda^{4/3}$ of the standard accretion disk around a single black hole. Using the lamp-post scenario and assuming that only the secondary black hole is active in a low-mass-ratio SMBHB, we design a simple continuum reverberation model to calculate the transfer function of the accretion disks and the resulting $\tau(\lambda)$ relations for various SMBHB orbital parameters. The transition wavelength typically can lie at UV/optical bands, mainly depending on the total mass and orbital separation of the SMBHB. We apply our SMBHB model to the intensive multiwavelength monitoring data of the SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and find that the SMBHB model can reproduce the inter-band time lags. Remarkably, the inferred total mass and orbital period from the SMBHB fitting are consistent with values derived from other independent methods.

#### Tidal heating in detached double white dwarf binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Short--period ($P<$1 hr orbits) detached double white dwarf binary (DWDB) components identified with transient surveys (e.g. SDSS, ZTF) have hot surface temperatures ($>$10,000 K) and observed radii a factor two larger than completely degenerate white dwarfs. We formulate tidal heating in helium composition extremely low mass white dwarf (ELM WD) components of detached DWDBs which reach mass transfer within a Hubble time. We combine a mass radius relation which varies with surface temperature and the tidal friction model of Hut 1981, where the additional orbital energy loss from tidal friction is accounted for by increases in the primary surface temperature, and hence increasing radius. Applying this heating model to the current sample of binaries with ZTF, we predict temperature increases from the present day of up to $\sim$40\% before the onset of mass transfer. We find that helium white dwarfs are generically hot and large at the onset of mass transfer, even for the oldest DWDBs whose components can cool to be degenerate by the present day. In the population of Galactic DWDBs, we find that the onset of mass transfer should occur at orbital periods as long as 1000s (17 minutes), or binary gravitational wave frequency of 2 mHz. This is over three times longer than periods expected for degenerate WD (5 minutes). Since mass transferring DWDBs are progenitors for a variety of transients and stellar populations e.g. RCrB stars, AM CVn binaries, type .Ia supernova, the finite temperature of donor white dwarfs should be taken into account.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of dark matter remains one of the most pressing open questions in modern cosmology. Despite extensive experimental efforts, no direct or indirect detection of dark matter particles has been confirmed. This has motivated alternative approaches, including modifications to the underlying theory of gravity. In this work, we investigate the implications of a specific non-local gravity (NLG) theory, which modifies General Relativity by introducing non-local effects that manifest as an effective dark matter component. We analyze the velocity dispersion profiles of eight classical dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies - Carina, Draco, Fornax, Leo I, Leo II, Sculptor, Sextans, and Ursa Minor - to test the predictions of NLG. Using the Jeans equation, we model the kinematics of these galaxies and perform a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to constrain the parameters of the NLG kernel chosen for our analysis. Our results indicate that NLG might successfully reproduce the observed kinematics of dSph galaxies without requiring particle dark matter, providing constraints on the scale-dependent modifications to gravity that are compatible with previous studies in the literature. However, a parameter inconsistency remains in the cases of Fornax and Sextans galaxies that requires further attention.

 - **Abstract**
 In the current study, we present the observational data constraints on the parameters space for an anisotropic cosmological model of Bianchi I type spacetime in general relativity (GR). For the analysis, we consider observational datasets of Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), and Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) peak parameters. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is utilized to constrain the bestfit values of the model parameters. For this purpose, we use the publicly available Python code from CosmoMC and have developed the contour plots with different constraint limits. For the joint dataset of CC, BAO, and CMBR, the parameter's best-fit values for the derived model are estimated as H_0 = 69.9\pm 1.4 km/s/Mpc, \Omega_{m0}=0.277^{+0.017}_{-0.015}, \Omega_{\Lambda 0} = 0.722^{+0.015}_{-0.017}, and \Omega_{\sigma 0} = 0.0009\pm0.0001. To estimate H(z), we explore machine learning (ML) techniques like linear regression, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and polynomial regression and thereafter analyze the results with the theoretically developed H(z) for the proposed model. Among these ML techniques, the polynomial regression exceeds the performance compared to other techniques. Further, we also note that larger dataset provides a better understanding of the cosmological scenario in terms of ML view point.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct detections of gravitational waves offer a unique opportunity to test gravity in the highly dynamical and strong field regime. Current tests are typically performed assuming signals from quasi-circular binaries. However, the complex waveform morphology induced by orbital eccentricity can enhance our ability to probe gravity with greater precision. A recent analysis of the neutron star-black hole event GW200105 identified strong evidence for orbital eccentricity. We extend an eccentric-precessing waveform model to test alternative models with this signal by incorporating eccentric corrections induced by Brans-Dicke, Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet, and dynamical Chern-Simons gravity at leading post-Newtonian order. We show that analyzing this event with a quasi-circular model leads to a false deviation from general relativity, while the inclusion of eccentricity improves the bounds on the models. Our analysis of GW200105 places tight constraints on Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, $\alpha^{1/2}_{\text{EdGB}} \lesssim 2.38\,\text{km}$, and Brans-Dicke gravity, $\omega_{\text{BD}} \gtrsim 3.5$, while dynamical Chern-Simons gravity remains unconstrained due to the low spin content.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) are well-motivated candidates for cold dark matter and may also account for a fraction of the binary black hole mergers observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. In this study, we investigate the gravitational-wave signatures of PBHs, with a particular focus on evaluating their integrated contribution to the stochastic gravitational-wave background arising from binary mergers over a broad range of redshifts. We perform a Bayesian analysis of gravitational-wave events following all Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog data, assuming a log-normal PBH mass function. We compute the merger rate distribution of PBH binaries by accounting for gravitational torques from the surrounding PBH. To constrain this rate, we employ the latest limits from the third observing run of LIGO/Virgo. Owing to their primordial origin, PBHs exhibit enhanced merger activity at high redshifts, prior to the onset of stellar formation. Our analysis yields a relatively weak inference on the redshift evolution index of the PBH merger rate, with $\alpha = 2.19^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$ at 68\% confidence level. The local merger rate of PBH binaries is found with posterior estimates lying in the range $23.5-30.3~\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, reflecting a high degree of statistical precision in the inferred distribution. Additionally, we emphasize the potential of stochastic gravitational-wave background observations to probe the cumulative history of PBH mergers across cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 The application of nonlinear electrodynamics at high energy scales has led to a variety of interesting phenomena in recent years, particularly within the context of non-singular spacetime geometries. Additionally, it is postulated that gravity near the Planck scale is governed by a minimal cut-off length, which acts as a renormalization scale against ultraviolet pathologies. Within this framework, we combine both concepts by introducing modifications to the electric and matter sectors of a black hole as its size approaches this minimal length. The result is an electrically charged black hole that is free from ultraviolet divergences and recovers the Maxwell limit at classical scales. We further explore the geometric and thermodynamic properties of the resulting solution within a cosmological anti-de Sitter background, revealing a chemical analogy with that of a Van der Waals fluid. Subsequently, we examine the charged black hole in de Sitter space and construct four corresponding gravitational instantons. We then study their cosmological quantum production using the formalism of the pair creation rate within the context of the no-boundary proposal.

 - **Abstract**
 Regular black holes, nonsingular solutions to gravitational collapse with quantum corrections, offer a compelling alternative to classical black holes with curvature singularities. In this work, we investigate how the presence of skewed dark matter distributions outside the innermost stable circular orbit of regular black holes modifies the gravitational wave signals emitted by such objects. Rather than introducing corrections directly into an effective potential, we model the influence of dark matter through metric corrections, allowing a full control over the spatial distribution and abundance of dark matter. We demonstrate that a skewed normal profile generically introduces shallow potential wells or secondary barriers in the effective potential of perturbation equations, depending sensitively on the type of perturbations: scalar, spinor, or tensor. These modifications lead to distinctive quasinormal mode features, including long-lived modes, echo effects, and in some cases, altered stability behaviors. Notably, the axial and polar sectors of tensor field perturbations respond asymmetrically to identical dark matter profiles, revealing a deeper structural distinction in their perturbation dynamics. These results provide a theoretical framework for probing regular black holes in the dark matter environment through gravitational wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We study cosmological perturbations in the minimal theory of mass-varying massive gravity (MTMVMG), a constrained extension of mass-varying massive gravity that propagates only three physical degrees of freedom. We show that MTMVMG admits a stable cosmological solutions i.e. free from ghost, gradient, and tachyonic instabilities around the homogeneous and isotropic background. We further demonstrate that the dynamical external scalar field$\textendash\textendash$which is responsible for the mass of the graviton$\textendash\textendash$can suitably serve as either dark energy or the inflaton, yielding a description consistent with current cosmological observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observational evidences point out towards a late time acceleration of the universe. In order to study the accelerated expansion, scientists have incorporated the existence of an exotic matter with negative pressure, termed as dark energy. Afterwards a new idea of dark energy have been studied depending on the holographic principle of quantum gravity, called as the Holographic Dark Energy(HDE). Later on modifying Bekestein-Hawking entropy, different generalized entropies have been proposed, one of them being Rényi entropy which leads to Rényi holographic dark energy model (RHDE). We have considered RHDE model with Hubble horizon as the IR cut off and have studied the cosmological behaviour under non interacting, linear and non-linear interacting scenarios with the help of dynamical systems analysis. We have also investigated the stability of the system around hyperbolic critical points along with the type of fluid description, evolution of equation of state parameter as well as matter and energy density parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 The orbital evolution of binary black hole (BBH) systems is determined by the component masses and spins of the black holes and the governing gravity theory. Gravitational wave (GW) signals from the evolution of BBH orbits offer an unparalleled opportunity for examining the predictions of General Relativity (GR) and for searching for missing physics in the current waveform models. We present a method of stacking up the time-frequency pixel energies through the orbital frequency evolution with the flexibility of gradually shifting the orbital frequency curve along the frequency axis. We observe a distinct energy peak corresponding to the GW signal's quadrupole mode. If an alternative theory of gravity is considered and the analysis of the BBH orbital evolution is executed following GR, the energy distribution on the time-frequency plane will be significantly different. We propose a new consistency test to check whether our theoretical waveform explains the BBH orbital evolution. Through the numerical simulation of beyond-GR theory of gravity and utilizing the framework of second-generation interferometers, we demonstrate the efficiency of this new method in detecting any possible departure from GR. Finally, when applied to an eccentric BBH system and GW190814, which shows the signatures of higher-order multipoles, our method provides an exquisite probe of missing physics in the GR waveform models.

#### Van der Waals Black Holes: Universality, Quantum Corrections, and Topological Classifications

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the universal extremality relation and thermodynamic topology of Van der Waals (VdW) black holes-solutions of Einstein's equations whose thermodynamic behavior closely resembles that of Van der Waals fluids. In the classical case, the black hole entropy obeys the Bekenstein-Hawking area law and satisfies the standard universality relation. We then incorporate quantum corrections using three distinct frameworks: the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP), and Rainbow Gravity. While these corrections modify the entropy law, we find that a generalized form of the universal extremality relation still holds. Next, we explore the thermodynamic topology of VdW black holes, focusing on the distribution of topological charges. Our analysis reveals that variations in the black hole and model parameters lead to significant changes in topological classifications and stability, as quantified by winding numbers. In the GUP-corrected case, topological charge distributions exhibit robustness against parameter variations, suggesting classification stability. For EUP-corrected black holes, we identify two distinct topological classes, with some configurations displaying three non-zero topological charges and others maintaining a total charge of zero, despite changes in individual charge counts. The Rainbow Gravity-corrected scenario shows similar consistency in topological behavior.

#### Dynamical potential and evolving circular orbits in dynamical spacetimes

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21885

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21885

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we extend the effective potential method to dynamical spacetimes by introducing a novel concept of dynamical potential and establishing three fundamental conditions that govern the evolution of circular orbits in such spacetimes. By generalizing the framework from static to dynamical spacetimes, we propose three conditions for the evolution equation of circular orbits: (1) The orbital radius of the evolving circular orbits does not explicitly depend on the affine parameter; (2) the dynamical potential does not change along the evolving circular orbits; and (3) the angular momentum of the evolving circular orbits is conserved. The dynamical potential conditions yield evolution equations for circular orbits that are shown to be equivalent to the quasi-local method. This approach provides a unified framework for analyzing orbital dynamics in time-dependent gravitational fields, with direct implications for black hole dynamics. The results bridge traditional effective potential methods with dynamical spacetime studies, enhancing the tools available for probing black hole mergers and evolving relativistic systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Employing the Newman-Penrose formalism and following the classic Teukolsky-like approach, we linearise the field equations of quadratic gravity on the Kerr background and combine them with the linearised Ricci and Bianch identities. This leads to constraints on linear perturbations of the Kerr spacetime in quadratic gravity. The resulting differential equations are decoupled in such a way that only the Ricci tensor perturbations need to be found on the Kerr background in order to fully determine the solution. The results are illustrated in the simple non-trivial cases of the Schwarzschild and Minkowski geometries.

#### Accretion dynamics in black holes with spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the spherical accretion of various types of fluids onto a Schwarzschild-like black hole solution modified by a Kalb-Ramond field implementing spontaneous Lorentz symmetry violation (LV). The system is analyzed for isothermal fluids characterized by the equation of state $p=\omega\rho$, including ultra-stiff, ultra-relativistic, and radiation fluids. We investigate the effect of the LV parameter $l$ on the fluid density $\rho(r)$, radial velocity $u(r)$, and accretion rate $\dot{M}$. Using a Hamiltonian dynamical systems approach, we examine the behavior near critical points and identify the sonic transitions in each scenario. Our results show that the LV parameter influences the location of critical points, the flow structure, and the accretion rate, with $l>0$ ($l<0$) enhancing (suppressing) the latter. For ultra-stiff fluids, no critical points are found, and the flow remains entirely subsonic. For ultra-relativistic and radiation fluids, transonic solutions exist, with the position of the sonic point depending on the sign of $l$. We also analyze polytropic fluids $p=\mathcal{K} \rho^{\Gamma}$ with $\Gamma=5/3$ and $\Gamma=4/3$, observing similar qualitative behavior, where the sonic transition is affected by both the equation of state and the LV parameter. These findings suggest that Lorentz symmetry breaking can significantly alter accretion dynamics in black hole spacetimes.

#### Universality of Heavy Operators in Matrix Models

 - **Abstract**
 In large $N$ theories with a gravity dual, generic heavy operators should be dual to black holes in the bulk. The microscopic details of such operators should then be irrelevant in the low energy theory. We look for such universality in the strong coupling limit of a very simple two matrix model -- the Hoppe model. Using analytics as well as Monte Carlo simulations, we show that there exists a universal black hole regime where the eigenvalue densities are given by parabolas and the correlation functions of probes in these backgrounds are completely determined by a few parameters. An important feature of strong coupling in this model is that the matrices commute and one can define joint eigenvalue distributions which also exhibit universality. These two results extend the beautiful findings of Berenstein, Hanada and Hartnoll. Not all heavy operators are universal and at strong coupling there is a sharp phase boundary between the universal and non universal regimes. Moreover, in the non universal phase, we also find an interesting phenomenon we call Abelianization where some eigenvalues run off to infinity, reminiscent of heavy dual giant gravitons in $\mathcal N=4$ SYM.

#### Extremal AdS Black Holes as Fluids: A Matrix Large-Charge EFT Approach

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21240

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a simple, yet powerful, matrix-valued large-charge EFT that captures the thermodynamic behavior of rotating extremal large-charge AdS black holes. We introduce a minimal "matrix EFT" by promoting the complex scalar in large charge EFT to a complex $N\times N$ adjoint scalar, whose $O(N^2)$ modes contribute at zero temperature. Employing a mean-field approximation, we solve the self-consistency equations and obtain explicit rigidly rotating fluid solutions. We demonstrate that their energy, angular momenta, and charge densities exactly reproduce the thermodynamics and boundary stress tensor of zero-temperature conformal fluids. A microscopic mode-counting further accounts for the $O(N^2)$ entropy. Via the fluid/gravity correspondence, this fluid describes an extremal AdS black hole in large charge limit. We also comment on supersymmetric BPS black holes, which fall outside the usual hydrodynamic regime but nevertheless exhibit simple, universal behavior in the large angular momentum limit. In this regime, their non-linear charge-spin relations simplify to form reminiscent of our extremal fluid solutions at large angular momentum limit.

 - **Abstract**
 If Kaluza-Klein ideas were correct as an explanation of Yang-Mills and General Relativity on spacetime, the extra fibre geometry would have to be a sphere of constant size of the order of 10 Planck lengths, hence subject to quantum gravity corrections. Conversely, it was shown in previous work that modelling such corrections by noncommutative coordinates indeed forces the Kaluza-Klein cylinder ansatz form of the metric, and we now propose that the remaining restrictions needed come from quantum gravity on the fibre. Working with a fuzzy sphere fibre, we find that the expected value of the metric is indeed spherical and we propose that it can be taken as of constant size due to freedom in the renormalisation of divergences. In this way, we outline a mechanism whereby the observed structure of gravity plus Yang-Mills can emerge at low energies as a consequence of quantum gravity effects.
