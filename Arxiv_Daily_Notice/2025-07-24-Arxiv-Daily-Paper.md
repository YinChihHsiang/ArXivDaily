#### Super-Eddington accretion onto black holes and its application to fallback accretion

 - **Abstract**
 We study the problem of steady-state spherical accretion onto a black hole, in which the internal energy of the flow is governed by radiation and photon diffusion dominates the energy flux at large radii. In the free-fall limit, the fluid equations can admit two types of solutions for a given accretion rate: (1) accretion flows that become isothermal at large radii and (2) solutions in which the temperature at infinity vanishes as a power law of the radius. Using boundary layer theory, we obtain analytic solutions for the two cases and apply our results to fallback accretion onto a black hole following a failed supernova explosion. We give predictions for the observational signature of fallback accretion using realistic progenitor properties from MESA, both for a fully ionized inflow and for the more realistic case in which recombination/ionization take place due to low photospheric temperatures. The observed fading sources coincident with the failed-supernova candidates in NGC 6946 and M31 are too luminous to be powered by spherical accretion onto newly formed black holes; the observed sources are instead likely due to accretion of the turbulent, convective envelope of the supergiant progenitor.

#### Strong scale-dependence does not enhance the kinematic boosting of gravitational wave backgrounds

 - **Abstract**
 Existing expressions in the literature appear to indicate that Doppler boosting, due to our proper motion with respect to the isotropic frame of the universe, can amplify stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds whose energy spectra exhibit strong scale dependence, for example, those generated by large scalar perturbations in models of primordial black holes or by astrophysical populations with broken power-law behaviour. It has been suggested that this enhancement could increase the signal-to-noise ratio of such backgrounds in pulsar timing measurements, as well as in ground- and space-based observatories. We show that the reported enhancement is an artefact of a Taylor expansion of the boosted signal, typically performed in the literature under the assumption of a small boosting parameter. This approximation fails to reproduce the correct result for signals with strong scale dependence. When Doppler boosting is treated exactly, the apparent amplification disappears. Using representative spectra, we demonstrate that Doppler motion induces only blue- and red-shifting by the expected amount; it does not lead to additional amplification or introduce new spectral features. The exact expression for the kinematic boost can and should be easily applied in analysing such backgrounds.

#### A unified spin-harmonic framework for correlating pulsar timing, astrometric deflection, and shimmering gravitational wave observations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16906

 - **Abstract**
 We present a unified spin-weighted harmonic framework that delivers analytic, diagonal expressions for the overlap (correlation) functions of three low frequency gravitational wave observables-pulsar timing redshifts, astrometric deflections, and time-dependent image distortions (``shimmering''). Writing each response in spin-$s$ spherical harmonics and rotating to a basis in which the wave tensor has definite helicity, we obtain compact closed-form series for every auto- and cross-correlation, recovering the Hellings-Downs curve as the $s=0$ limit and deriving its astrometric ($s=\pm 1$) and shimmering ($s=\pm 2$) analogues. The formalism naturally extends to non-standard scalar-breathing, longitudinal, and vector polarisation modes, clarifying when higher-spin observables are (and are not) sourced and providing a complete set of harmonic spectra $C_\ell$ ready for parameter estimation pipelines. These results supply the common theoretical language needed to combine upcoming pulsar timing, Gaia-class astrometric, and high resolution imaging data sets, enabling coherent, multi probe searches for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, tests of general relativity and its alternatives across the nano- to micro-hertz gravitational wave band.

#### Predicting the Properties of the Fallback Rate from Tidal Disruption Events: Investigating the Maximum Gravity Model

 - **Abstract**
 A star destroyed by the tidal field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a tidal disruption event (TDE) gives rise to a luminous flare. TDEs are being detected at an ever-increasing rate, motivating the need for accurate models of their lightcurves. The ``maximum gravity'' (MG) model posits that a star is completely destroyed when the tidal field of the SMBH exceeds the maximum self-gravitational field within the star, $g_{\rm max}$, and predicts the peak fallback rate $\dot{M}_{\rm peak}$ and the time to peak $t_{\rm peak}$. Here we perform hydrodynamical simulations of the complete disruption of 24 stars with masses ranging from $0.2-5.0 M_\odot$, at different stages of their main sequence evolution, to test the predictions of this model. We find excellent agreement between the MG model predictions and our simulations for stars near the zero-age main sequence, while the predictions are less accurate (but still within $\sim 35-50\%$ of the simulation results) for highly evolved stars. We also generalize the MG model to incorporate the Paczy{ń}ski-Wiita potential to assess the impact of strong-gravity effects -- which are especially important for deep encounters that are required to completely destroy evolved and centrally concentrated stars -- and find good agreement with recent works that include relativistic gravity. Our results demonstrate that this model provides accurate constraints on the peak timescale of TDE lightcurves and their correlation with black hole mass.

#### Detection of a dark matter sub-halo near the Sun from pulsar timing

 - **Abstract**
 Using pulsar accelerations, we identify and constrain the properties of a dark matter sub-halo in the Galaxy for the first time from analyzing the excess, correlated power in the acceleration field of binary pulsars. We find that this sub-halo has a mass of $1.02^{+3.47}_{-0.90} \times 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ and is located at Galactic coordinates $d = 0.93^{+0.32}_{-0.38}$ kpc, $b=36.78^{+17.59}_{-23.55}$, $l=30.16^{+19.36}_{-23.82}$, or equivalently at Galactocentric coordinates $X = 7.52^{+0.34}_{-0.38}~\rm$ kpc, $Y = 0.36^{+0.39}_{-0.43} ~\rm kpc$, $Z = 0.53^{+0.41}_{-0.45} ~\rm kpc$. We examine \textit{Gaia} data and the atomic and molecular hydrogen data of our Galaxy and show that this excess power cannot arise from the gas or the stars in our Galaxy. Additionally, by analyzing the full sample of binary pulsars with available acceleration measurements that span 3.4 kpc in Galactocentric radius from the Sun and 3.6 kpc in vertical height, we find that massive (with mass $>10^{8}~M_{\odot}~$) sub-halos are disfavored for the Milky Way within several kiloparsec of the Sun. The detection of a $10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ sub-halo within a few kpc of the Sun is potentially consistent with the expected number counts of sub-halos in the prevailing $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, for a substantial sub-halo mass fraction. The pulsar accelerations are however better fit by a compact object, such as arising from a primordial black hole or a sub-halo having a steep density profile, as in self-interacting dark matter. As the number and precision of direct acceleration measurements continues to grow, we will obtain tighter constraints on dark matter sub-structure in our Galaxy. These measurements now open a new avenue for studying dark matter and have implications across many fields of astrophysics - from understanding the nature of dark matter to galaxy formation.

#### Monodromic Dark Energy and DESI

 - **Abstract**
 Recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have renewed interest in dynamical dark energy models, particularly those that cross the "phantom divide" ($w_{\rm DE} = -1$). We present the first observational constraints on monodromic k-essence, a physically motivated scalar field dark energy scenario capable of realizing rapid oscillations about the phantom divide. Using cosmic microwave background (CMB) information, DESI DR2 BAO measurements, and Type Ia supernovae observations, we constrain the amplitude, frequency, phase, and power-law index describing the monodromic k-essence scenario at the background level. We find that the monodromic dark energy scenario can fit these datasets with a $\chi^2$ that is comparable to the phenomenological $w_0$-$w_a$ parametrization. While the CMB and BAO data alone are consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, the inclusion of DESY5 supernovae shows a preference for a non-zero amplitude, $A=0.44^{+0.16}_{-0.12}$ (fully marginalized 68% C.L.). Conversely, inclusion of the Pantheon-Plus supernovae provides no evidence for monodromic k-essence, with $A<0.43$ (95% C.L.). We show that constraints on both monodromic dark energy and $w_0$-$w_a$ models are sensitive to the DESI DR2 LRG2 BAO distance, especially in the absence of supernovae data.

#### Quantifying the Impact of 2D and 3D BAO Measurements on the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation with HII Galaxy observation

 - **Abstract**
 The cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) is a fundamental and practical condition in observational cosmology that connects the luminosity distance and angular diameter distance. Testing its validity offers a powerful tool to probe new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, for the first time, we present a novel consistency test of CDDR by combining HII galaxy data with a comprehensive set of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. The BAO measurements include two-dimensional (2D) BAO and three-dimensional (3D) BAO, as well as the latest 3D BAO data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2). We adopt four different parameterizations of the CDDR parameter, $\eta(z)$, to investigate possible deviations and their evolution with cosmic time. To ensure accurate redshift matching across datasets, we reconstruct the distance measures through a model-independent Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach. Our analysis uniquely examines two distinct approaches: $i)$ marginalization over the BAO sound horizon $r_d$, and $ii)$ fixing $r_d$ to specific values. We find no significant deviation from the CDDR (less than 68% confidence level) in either the marginalized $r_d$ or the $r_d=147.05$ Mpc scenario. However, a slight deviation at the 68% confidence level is found when applying 2D-BAO data with $r_d=139.5$ Mpc. Furthermore, our analysis shows that all BAO data considered in this work support the validity of the CDDR, where 3D-DESI BAO provides the tightest constraints. We find no tension between 2D and 3D BAO measurements, which confirms their mutual consistency. In addition, the treatment of the sound horizon $r_d$ significantly impacts $\eta(z)$ constraints, which proves its importance in CDDR tests. Finally, the consistency of our results supports the standard CDDR and demonstrates the robustness of our analytical approach.

 - **Abstract**
 In the era of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, GW standard siren observations from binary neutron star mergers provide a powerful tool for probing the expansion history of the universe. Since sterile neutrinos can influence cosmic evolution by modifying the radiation content and suppressing structure formation, GW standard sirens offer promising prospects for constraining sterile neutrino properties within a cosmological framework. Building on this, we investigate the prospects for detecting sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy (DE) models using joint observations from 3G GW detectors and a future short gamma-ray burst detector, such as a THESEUS-like telescope. We consider three DE models: the $w$CDM, holographic DE (HDE), and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. Our results show that the properties of DE can influence the constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of GW data significantly improves constraints on both sterile neutrino parameters and other cosmological parameters across all three models, compared to the current limits derived from CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) observations. When GW data are included into the CBS dataset, a preference for $\Delta N_{\rm eff} > 0$ emerges at approximately the $1\sigma$ level in the $w$CDM and CPL models, and reaches about $3\sigma$ in the HDE model. Moreover, the upper limits on $m_{\nu,{\rm sterile}}^{\rm eff}$ are reduced by approximately 13%, 75%, and 3% in the $w$CDM, HDE, and CPL models, respectively.

#### Estimating the baryon fraction in the IGM from well-localized FRBs and DESI data

 - **Abstract**
 Current measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI DR2), when combined with data from Type Ia supernovae (SNe), challenge the observational viability of the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, motivating combinations of independent datasets to estimate cosmological quantities. In a previous communication, we presented a cosmological independent method to constrain the baryon fraction in the IGM ($f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$), where we derived relevant expressions for the dispersion measure ($\mathrm{DM}$) in terms of luminosity distance, allowing us to estimate $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ combining directly measurements of 17 well-localized FRBs and 1048 SNe from the Pantheon catalog. Here we revisit this method to constrain $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$, considering two parameterizations for the $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$: constant and time-dependent. We expand our sample by combining 107 well-localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) with BAO measurements from DESI DR2 and SNe observations from DESY5, and the Pantheon+ catalog. We find through a Bayesian model selection analysis that a conclusive answer about the evolution of $f_{\mathrm{IGM}}$ cannot be achieved from the current FRBs observational data. In particular, our results show weak evidence in favor of the constant case.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, it has been shown that a quantum system held in spatial superposition and then eventually recombined does experience decoherence from black hole horizons, at a level increasing linearly with the time the superposition has been kept open. In this, the effects of the horizon have been derived using a classical spacetime picture for the latter. In the present note we point out that quantum aspects of the geometry itself of the quantum black hole could significantly affect the results. In a specific effective implementation of the quantum geometry in terms of a minimal length and ensuing minimal area, it appears in particular that, for selected values of the quantum of area proposed on various grounds in the literature, the decoherence induced by the horizon turns out to be limited to negligibly small values.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole evaporation is one of the most striking phenomena at the interface between gravity and quantum physics. In Hawking's semi-classical treatment, where matter is quantum mechanical and the spacetime is definite and classical, evaporation leads to an apparent loss of unitarity of the overall evolution, and to the so-called black hole information paradox. Here, we go beyond this semi-classical treatment and formulate a toy quantum model of black hole evaporation that allows the black hole to evolve into a superposition of being fully evaporated and not fully evaporated, consistent with the Hawking particles being in a coherent superposition of different energy levels. We model Hawking particle production by the repeated action of quantum-controlled unitaries, generating emission from the quantum black hole and accounting for a quantum coherent back-reaction on the black hole matter state. We show that the probability of full annihilation of the black hole matter increases with time until the black hole is, asymptotically, fully evaporated in every branch of the quantum superposition. We prove that under natural assumptions, this evaporation model is unitary, such that the initial state can in principle be recovered from the final asymptotic state of the radiation.

#### Connecting Early Dark Energy to Late Dark Energy by the Diluting Matter Potential

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we study a scale invariant gravity theory containing two scalar fields, dust particles and a measure defined from degrees of freedom independent of the metric. The integration of the degrees of freedom that define the measure spontaneously break the scale symmetry, leaving us in the Einstein frame with an effective potential that is dependent on the density of the particles. The potential contains three flat regions, one for inflation, another for early dark energy and the third for late dark energy. At a certain point, as the matter dilutes, tunneling from the early dark energy to the late dark energy can start efficiently. This mechanism naturally alleviated the observed Hubble tension by modifying the sound horizon prior to recombination while preserving late-time cosmology. Moreover, the model predictions are consistent with observations from the reduced CMB, BAO, and local measurement of $H_0$, providing a coherent and unified description of the universe. In this context, the Bayesian analysis of these datasets confirms the viability of our scenario, with the best-fit parameters indicating an early dark energy fraction of approximately 30$\%$ at a redshift of $z'=5000$.

#### Generic EFT-motivated beyond General Relativity gravitational wave tests and their curvature dependence: from observation to interpretation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17143

 - **Abstract**
 We present a "dictionary" to expedite the identification of potential deviations in gravitational waveforms from those predicted by General Relativity (GR) during the inspiral phase of black hole binaries. Assuming deviations from GR can be described by a local Effective Field Theory (EFT) formulated in terms of curvature operators (and possibly additional scalar fields), this dictionary characterizes how deviations scale with the masses of the binary components and identifies the leading order Post-Newtonian corrections in generic theories constructed within the EFT framework. By establishing a direct connection between observations and candidate theories beyond GR, this dictionary also aids in distinguishing genuine physical effects from systematic errors. These results can be readily incorporated into essentially all existing tests for the inspiral regime and, in particular, facilitate a more efficient combination of data from multiple events.

#### Greybody factors in Horndeski gravity and beyond

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17329

 - **Abstract**
 In the framework of the beyond Horndeski action, we consider three sub-theories, that support scalarised black-hole solutions, and look for modified characteristics compared to GR. We first study the propagation of massless scalar and vector test fields in the fixed background of an analytical spherically-symmetric black hole derived in the context of a parity-symmetric beyond Horndeski theory, and show that the profiles of the effective gravitational potentials, greybody factors, absorption cross-sections and quasinormal frequencies exhibit distinct modifications as we move away from the GR limit. We then turn our attention to the perturbations of the gravitational field itself and adopt a full-theory analysis that takes into account the backreaction of the scalar field on the metric. Employing as background solutions scalarised black holes arising in the shift-symmetric Horndeski theory and in the Quadratic-Quartic-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory, we compute the greybody factors and QNMs of the axial sector. In both theories, in direct correspondence to the form of the gravitational potential which features multiple extremal points, we find modified (suppressed or non-monotonic) greybody curves and altered quasinormal frequencies (smaller oscillating frequencies and larger damping times), especially as the hair-sourcing parameter increases.

#### Mass-Gap Neutron Stars from Vector \texorpdfstring{$f(R)$}{f(R)} Gravity Inflationary Deformations

 - **Abstract**
 The latest observations from the LIGO-Virgo indicated the existence of mass-gap region astrophysical objects. This is a rather sensational observation and there are two possibilities for the nature of these mass-gap region astrophysical objects, these are either small black holes that result from the mergers of ordinary mass neutron stars, or these are heavy neutron stars. In the line of research implied by the former possibility, in this work we shall examine the implied neutron star phenomenology from vector $f(R)$ gravity inflationary models. These theories are basically scalar-tensor deformations of the Starobinsky inflationary model. We shall present the essential features of cosmologically viable and non-viable deformations of the Starobinsky model, originating from vector $f(R)$ gravity inflationary theories, and we indicate which models and for which equations of state provide a viable neutron star phenomenology. We solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations using a robust double shooting LSODA python based code, for the following piecewise polytropic equations of state the WFF1, the SLy, the APR, the MS1, the AP3, the AP4, the ENG, the MPA1 and the MS1b. We confront the resulting phenomenology with several well known neutron star constraints and we indicate which equation of state and model fits the phenomenological constraints. A remarkable feature, also known from other inflationary attractor models, is that the MPA1 is the equation of state which is most nicely fitted the constraints, for all the theoretical models used, and actually the maximum mass for this equation of state is well inside the mass-gap region. Another mentionable feature that stroked us with surprise is the fact that even cosmologically non-viable inflationary models produced a viable neutron star phenomenology, which most likely has to be a model-dependent feature.

#### A Non-Commutative Kalb-Ramond Black Hole

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17390

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents a new black hole solution within the framework of a non-commutative gauge theory applied to Kalb-Ramond gravity. Using the method recently proposed in the literature [Nucl.Phys.B 1017 (2025) 116950], we employ the Moyal twist $\partial_r \wedge \partial_\theta$ to implement non-commutativity, being encoded by parameter $\Theta$. We begin by verifying that the resulting black hole no longer possesses spherical symmetry, while the event horizon remains unaffected by non-commutative corrections. The Kretschmann scalar is computed to assess the corresponding regularity. It turns out that the solution is regular, provided that the Christoffel symbols and related quantities are not expanded to second order in $\Theta$. We derive the thermodynamic quantities, including the Hawking temperature $T^{(\Theta,\ell)}$, entropy $S^{(\Theta,\ell)}$, and heat capacity $C_V^{(\Theta,\ell)}$. The remnant mass $M_{\text{rem}}$ is estimated by imposing $T^{(\Theta,\ell)} \to 0$, although the absence of a physical remnant indicates complete evaporation. Quantum radiation for bosons and fermions is analyzed via the tunneling method, where divergent integrals are treated using the residue theorem. Notably, in the low-frequency regime, the particle number density for bosons surpasses that of fermions (at least within the scope of the methods considered here). The effective potential for a massless scalar field is obtained perturbatively, enabling the computation of quasinormal modes and the time-domain profiles. Finally, further bounds on $\Theta$ and $\ell$ (Lorentz-violating paramter) are derived from solar system tests, including the perihelion precession of Mercury, light deflection, and the Shapiro time delay.

 - **Abstract**
 In the poltergeist mechanism the enhancement of induced gravitational waves (GWs) occurs due to a sudden transition from an early matter-dominated era to the radiation-dominated era. In this work, we calculate the bispectrum of induced GWs from the poltergeist mechanism by adopting the sudden transition approximation. We find that the tensor bispectrum peaks either in the equilateral or squeezed configurations, depending on scales. Such a characteristic behavior enables us to distinguish it from that from other GW generation mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes regain their static configuration by emitting ringdown gravitational waves, whose amplitude decays in time following a power law at fixed spatial positions. We show that the nonlinear decay power law may be obtained by simple scattering calculations using the in-in formalism and argue that the nonperturbative law should be $t^{-2\ell-1}$, where $\ell$ is the multipole of the propagating spherical gravitational wave.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17313

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the physical consequences of scattering Hawking radiation emitted in the vicinity of the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. The Hawking radiation from the horizon becomes soft at a large distance away from the horizon due to the gravitational redshift, and the above process is exactly the soft theorem in curved spacetime. For an observer located at infinity, such a scattering process introduces a large gauge transformation, which can be regarded as a memory effect. The large gauge transformation is expected to encode more information about the radiation and might shed light on the black hole information paradox.
