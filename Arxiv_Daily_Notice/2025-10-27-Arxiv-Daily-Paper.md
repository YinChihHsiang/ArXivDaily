 - **Abstract**
 We report the first direct measurement of galaxy assembly bias, a critical systematic in cosmology, from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Bright Galaxy Survey. We introduce a novel, cosmology-independent method to measure the halo occupation distribution (HOD) by combining a state-of-the-art group catalog with weak gravitational lensing. For groups binned by total luminosity, we determine the galaxy occupation number $N_{\rm gal}$ from group-galaxy cross-correlations, while weak lensing constrains the average halo mass $M_h$. Applying this to a volume-limited sample at $z{\in}[0.05,0.2]$, we measure the dependence of HOD, $N_{\rm gal}(M_h)$, on large-scale overdensity $\delta_{g}$. Focusing on the satellite galaxies, we find an assembly bias parameter of $Q_{\rm sat}{=}0.05{\pm}0.14$, a result consistent with zero and in tension with many empirical galaxy formation models. Our method provides a robust approach for characterizing galaxy assembly bias to achieve precision cosmology with DESI and future Stage-V surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in dwarf galaxies remains poorly understood, with conventional wisdom suggesting it primarily suppresses star formation. Using high-resolution MACER3D simulations that directly resolve the Bondi radius, we demonstrate that AGN feedback can significantly enhance rather than suppress star formation in starburst dwarf galaxies. Our simulations reveal that AGN feedback increases global star formation rates by approximately 25% when comparing our models with both AGN and supernova feedback to those with only supernova feedback. This enhancement occurs through AGN-driven outflows creating compressed gas regions where efficient cooling preserves the high density while quickly radiating away thermal energy, creating ideal conditions for star formation. This positive feedback mechanism operates in gas-rich starburst environments with efficient cooling and moderate AGN energy input that compresses gas without expelling it from the galaxy. Critically, it requires both AGN and supernova feedback working in concert: without SN feedback to regulate black hole activity, AGN outflows become too powerful and expel gas rather than compress it. Our results closely match observations of the starburst dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10, where similar shock-compressed regions of enhanced star formation have been observed. These findings challenge conventional understanding of AGN feedback and suggest that AGN may play a previously unrecognized role in accelerating star formation during active phases of dwarf galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, exhibits daily energetic flares characterized by non-thermal emission in the infrared and X-ray bands. While the underlying accretion flow is a Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow (RIAF) peaking at radio frequencies, the mechanism powering these non-thermal transients remains debated. Stellar dynamics predict a population of faint brown dwarfs orbiting Sgr A*. These objects are progenitors of Extremely Large Mass Ratio Inspirals (XMRIs), crucial sources of low-frequency gravitational waves for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. We investigate whether the tidal stripping of brown dwarfs provides a viable fueling mechanism for the observed flares. Here we present high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of grazing tidal interactions coupled with a parameterized non-thermal radiation model. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the tidal fallback and subsequent viscous evolution naturally reproduce the fundamental temporal characteristics of observed flares: the peak luminosity and the characteristic 1-hour duration. We show that this fueling mechanism is dynamically viable and energetically consistent, placing strong constraints on the required efficiency of the non-thermal emission process, suggesting extreme radiative inefficiency. These findings provide compelling evidence for a hidden population of brown dwarfs in the Galactic Center. Crucially, the observed high flare frequency implies tight orbits characteristic of advanced inspirals. This establishes a direct link between electromagnetic transients and active gravitational wave sources, alerting the LISA consortium years in advance to the presence of specific XMRI systems promising exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratios for precision tests of general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the relationship among the jet magnetic field, black hole spin, black hole mass, Eddington ratio, and optical variability timescales in jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs). By fitting a damped random walk (DRW) model to the g-band light curves, we obtain the characteristic variability timescale ($\tau_{\rm DRW}$) for 41 jetted AGNs with precise supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass measurements. Our main results are as follows: (i) Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between the jet magnetic field ($B_{\rm 1pc}$), black hole spin ($j$) and the characteristic variability timescale within our sample. These findings suggest that the optical variability of jetted AGNs is influenced by the jet magnetic field and black hole spin. Furthermore, the characteristic variability timescale aligns with the electron escape timescale, as evidenced by the relationship between the characteristic variability timescale and jet magnetic field ($\tau_{\rm DRW}\propto B_{\rm 1pc}^{0.76\pm0.22}$). (ii) We confirm a significant correlation between the characteristic variability timescale and SMBH mass, expressed as: $\log \rm \tau_{\rm DRW} = 0.52(\pm0.21)\log M _{\rm BH}/M_{\rm \odot}-3.12(\pm1.90)$, with an intrinsic scatter of 0.08 dex. The slope of this relationship is consistent with that between the thermal timescale and black hole mass. Our results support the hypothesis that magnetorotational instability (MRI) fluctuations drive the intrinsic variability observed in the light curves emitted by the AGNs accretion disk.

 - **Abstract**
 The electromagnetic detection of circumbinary disks around pre-merger binary black holes (BBHs) relies on theoretical predictions. These are generally obtained through expensive numerical simulations, but simple or fast toy models are lacking to unleash the potential of these theoretical advances for observational purposes. We aim to present a simple toy model to compute the electromagnetic variability of circumbinary disks around circular-orbit BBHs at relativistic separations, focusing on the impact of disk non-axisymmetries. We assume that the disk is threaded by spiral arms and hosts a hotspot linked to an overdense structure (the {\lq}lump{\rq}) preferably reported in binaries close to equal mass. We build a simple temperature distribution, and estimate its thermal emission, perceived by a distant observer, via a ray-tracing code in a BBH approximate metric. We propose a toy model reproducing the main lightcurve features and show it is consistent with 2D general-hydrodynamical simulations under the assumption of compressional heating and expansional cooling except for purely dynamical effects such as the binary-lump beat. The lightcurve exhibits a main modulation at the lump's period (i.e. a few times the orbital period), due to relativistic Doppler effect, and a shorter one at the orbital-like period, due to spiral arms or the beat. These are more prominent in the optical/UV band for a total binary mass $M\, {=} \, 10^{4-10}\mathrm{M_\odot}$, where the disk energy spectrum peaks. For $M=10^{9}\mathrm{M_\odot}$, a $4\%$-amplitude lump modulation is detectable with the Vera Rubin Observatory after six months of observation, up to $z\, {=}\, 0.5$. We proposed a new, simple toy model that can be used, for instance, to test the compatibility of the periodicity of BBH candidate sources with a circumbinary disk origin.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary black holes (BBHs) in the vicinity of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are particularly interesting systems from both a cosmological and astrophysical point of view. Matter and radiation fields within the dense AGN environment could produce electromagnetic and neutrino emission in addition to gravitational waves (GWs). Moreover, interactions between BBHs and AGN accretion disks are expected to influence BBH formation channels and merger rates. Understanding these sources could help explain the unexpectedly high BBH masses observed through GWs by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations. We present a search for coincident gravitational-wave and neutrino emission from AGNs. Our innovative approach combines information from gravitational-wave data, neutrino observations, and AGN optical catalogs to increase the chances of identifying potential sources and studying their properties. We assess the sensitivity of the search using subthreshold gravitational-wave candidates from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, neutrino event candidates from public IceCube Neutrino Observatory data and AGN candidates from the Quaia catalog. A confident detection of such an event would mark a breakthrough in multi-messenger astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a quintessence model involving two scalar fields with double-exponential potentials. This configuration allows the system as a whole to emulate the dynamics of a single field with a shallower potential, enabling scalar fields that individually cannot drive cosmic acceleration to collectively achieve and sustain it. We assess the viability of this model by performing a fully Bayesian analysis and confronting its predictions with observational data, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shift parameters, the newly released Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) Type Ia supernova (SnIa) sample. Our analysis shows that the two-field quintessence model yields a log Bayes factor relative to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model of $\Delta \ln B \sim 4$, indicating moderate evidence against the latter. We also find that the central values of the two slopes of the exponential potentials are both close to 1, whereas the slope of an effective single-field system is constrained to be less than order unity. This property is theoretically desirable from the perspective of higher-dimensional theories. Thus, the two-field quintessence model with exponential potentials provides a physically motivated and compelling mechanism that is consistent with both observational and theoretical requirements.

 This work is based on the letter Phys. Lett. B, 865, 139484 (2025), where we developed the analytical expression of the coordinate time in terms of the eccentric anomaly at the second post-Newtonian order in General Relativity for a compact binary system moving on eccentric orbits. The aim of this paper is to provide more details about the performed calculations and to produce other new results. More specifically, we will focus on deriving the analytical expression of the coordinate time at the second Post-Newtonian order for circular orbits and then discuss two astrophysical applications involving binary neutron star and black hole systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the thermodynamic topology and microscopic interaction properties of charged black holes in RegMax gravity, focusing on the role of the coupling parameter $\alpha$. Using the Duan topological current method together with Ruppeiner geometry, we show that $\alpha$ controls a sharp change in phase structure. Above a certain critical threshold, we find that the Duan defect curve develops an intermediate branch and vertical tangency points, producing continuous (second-order) critical behaviour. Furthermore, the Ruppeiner curvature becomes negative at very small horizon radii before turning positive and progressively vanishing at larger radii. By contrast, below the critical value of the coupling, the intermediate black hole phase disappears, and the system shows a simpler small/large first-order/coexistence behaviour driven by free-energy competition. In this regime, the Ruppeiner curvature remains predominantly positive. Overall, increasing $\alpha$ enriches the thermodynamic topology (allowing for second-order criticality) while simultaneously reducing the domain in which classical energy conditions (ECs) are satisfied, thus linking exotic thermodynamic behaviour to more severe violations of standard energy conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the study of regular black holes, driven by the search for singularity-free geometries. This research has revealed intriguing similarities between the regularization mechanisms used in black hole models and those employed in quantum field theory, such as the introduction of exponential suppression or energy cutoffs. We propose a systematic exponential cutoff regularization scheme for static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions in general relativity. The method explored in this paper serves as an alternative to the black-bounce singularity suppression mechanism proposed by Simpson and Visser, which involves a coordinate remapping $r \rightarrow\sqrt{r^2+a^2}$, as well as to the mechanism proposed by Bronnikov, which employs a Bardeen-type remapping in the metric. The method presented here introduces exponential factors in the mass function, smoothing curvature divergences and ensuring geodesic completeness under specific conditions. This approach allows the regularization of known singular spacetimes without altering their asymptotic structure. We analyze curvature invariants, horizon formation, and thermodynamic properties, showing that the regularized geometries avoid singularities while maintaining physical consistency. As examples of application, we regularize the Schwarzschild black hole and present a novel regularized Kiselev solution. The method provides a unified framework to systematically generate singularity-free black holes within classical general relativity

 - **Abstract**
 Using ray-tracing techniques, this paper investigates the optical and polarization images of rotating black holes in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity illuminated by thick accretion disks. We consider two accretion disk models: the phenomenological model and the HOU disk model, where the phenomenological model includes both isotropic and anisotropic radiation. In all models, the external bright rings corresponding to the high-order image and the internal dark region associated with the event horizon are observed. At high observational inclinations, the inner shadows are obscured by the radiation from the equatorial plane, which is significantly different from the thin accretion disk model. The primary distinction between isotropic and anisotropic radiation is that the latter causes distortion of the high-order image in the vertical direction, resulting in an elliptical structure. For the HOU disk model, due to certain regions are geometrically thinner under the conical approximation, the high-order images are narrower compared to the phenomenological model. Furthermore, we find that an increase in the rotational parameter $a$ leads to an asymmetry in the intensity distribution of the high-order image, while an increase in the spontaneous Lorentz violating parameters, $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$, results in a decrease in the size of the high-order image. In the polarization image, the linear polarization is found to be significantly influenced by the intensity, while it is relatively less affected by the parameters $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$. The electric vector position angle is mainly affected by the parameters $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$.

#### Exact Regions of Superradiant Instability of Kerr-Newman Black Holes and Massive Scalar Fields

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the superradiant instability of Kerr-Newman black holes in the presence of a massive, charged scalar field using the Vieira-Bezerra-Kokkotas (VBK) method. We study the solutions of the exact polynomial condition for quasibound state frequencies and determine the domain of superradiant instability in parameter space without relying on the hydrogenic approximation or numerics. We derive the minimum scalar mass needed for quasibound states to exist, and identify the precise overlap region between the quasibound and superradiant conditions where instability can occur. Through a perturbative analysis of the resonance equation, we obtain analytic expressions for the instability boundaries and growth rates, and clarify their relation to previous numerical results. Our analysis reveals how the instability region shifts from nearly neutral Kerr black holes for light fields to highly charged near-extremal Kerr-Newman black holes for heavier fields, while remaining absent in the Reissner-Nordstrom limit.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the late-time cosmological expansion of a modified teleparallel gravity model of type logarithmic type. This modified gravitational lagrangian yields a cosmological constant term and also power-law corrections to the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) for small $\lambda$. By using the cosmological chronometers and the type Ia supernove data from the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset, we fit the parameters of the modified gravitational dynamics assuming $H(z)$ parametrized by a quadratic expansion. The results exhibit an accelerated expansion with parameter $q = - 0.435 \pm 0.028$. In addition, we analyzed the effective energy density, pressure and state parameter $\omega$. It turns out that, this modified gravitational theory produces solutions similar to the quintessence and phantom models.

 - **Abstract**
 We argue that the standard post-Newtonian expansion scheme used in General Relativity leaves room for time-space components $g_{ti}$ of the metric to be of the same order of the usual gravitational potential. We explore this possibility and find that such leading order contributions to $g_{ti}$ are related to the Coriolis field of Newton-Cartan gravity. We investigate the possibility that Coriolis fields mimic dark matter effects in disk galaxies. We find solutions from their field equations that sustain the velocity rotation curves in the bulge region and beyond it, notably describing flattish velocity profiles. We dub such solutions Dark Coriolis Fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Exploring the influence of plasma on the light rays trajectories in the vicinity of black holes is significat since that astrophysical black holes are generally surrounded by a plasma medium. In this work, we analyze the null geodesics in the space-time of rotating hairy Horndeski black holes immersed in a plasma medium using the Hamilton-Jacobi method. By considering both uniform and non-uniform plasma distributions, we perform a comparative study of their effects on the black hole shadow. The impact of the hair parameter and the inclination angle on the black hole shadow is also investigated. Finally, the shadow results are compared with observational data of the Event Horizon Telescope for M87* to constrain the plasma parameter.

 - **Abstract**
 Spacetimes arising from nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) are a good laboratory for studying both the nature of regular black holes (RBH) solutions and the imprints of nonlinear electromagnetic fields within this context. Over the past few decades, NED-sourced black hole (BH) spacetimes have attracted considerable attention, but electrically charged RBHs obtained in the so-called $F$ framework have been less addressed in the literature. We consider two members of the h-family of electrically charged, fully RBHs that are solutions to general relativity minimally coupled to NED. Because of their potential astrophysical and astronomical applications, we mainly focus our investigation on the motion of photons and its implications in the shadow radius and gravitational and kinematic redshift, considering the effective geometry followed by photons in NED. For a BH charge-to-mass ratio below some moderate value, there is almost no way to distinguish these members (and likely all members) of the h-family from the Reissner-Nordström (RN) BH. In its turn, for a BH charge-to-mass ratio above some moderate value, we observe discrepancies in their physical and geometric properties in comparison to those of the RN BH. Furthermore, we also consider observational data for Sagittarius A$^{*}$ and Messier 87$^{*}$ BHs to impose some constraints on the charge-to-mass ratio of the fully RBHs.

#### The Yilmaz-Rosen and Janis-Newman-Winicour metric solutions in the scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet $4d$ gravitational model

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (sEGB) $4d$ gravitational model with a scalar field $\varphi\left(u\right)$, Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet terms. The model action contains a potential term $U\left(\varphi\right)$, a Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $f\left(\varphi\right)$ and a parameter $\varepsilon = \pm 1$, where $\varepsilon = 1$ corresponds to the ordinary scalar field, and $\varepsilon = -1$ to the phantom field. In this paper we applied the sEGB reconstruction procedure from our previous work \cite{Er_Ivash} to the Yılmaz-Rosen metric, a solution potentially describing a quasi-black hole without an event horizon. Within this framework, we also derived analytical solutions based on scalar-tensor theory with minimal coupling. Our results indicate that for this configuration, the potential $U$ vanishes and the scalar field is phantom-like. Furthermore, an analysis of the Einstein equations in the Yılmaz-Rosen metric reveals that all energy conditions are violated. The corresponding energy-momentum tensor suggests the presence of exotic matter with negative pressure, as indicated by the negative value of $T_u^u$. This could originate from a scalar field (such as the Higgs field or another nonlinear field), or from phenomena like dark energy or quintessence. In addition, we considered the application of our reconstruction method in the sEGB model in the Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) metric. As noted in this paper, the Yılmaz-Rosen metric is a limiting case of the Janus metric (as $s \to +\infty$). Furthermore, we obtained some exact solutions of scalar-tensor theory with minimal coupling in the JNW metric.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute thermal holographic correlators by combining their analytic structure with the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition and a finite set of multi-stress tensor OPE coefficients determined from the dual AdS description. We focus on two-point functions of identical scalar operators with integer conformal dimensions at zero spatial separation. For correlators holographically dual to black brane backgrounds, we show that our results satisfy all relevant consistency conditions and agree with numerical solutions of the bulk wave equation. We further demonstrate that the expansion in generalized free field correlators proposed in [Barrat,6/2025] admits a natural interpretation in terms of Witten diagrams. Finally, we extend our analysis to spherically symmetric black hole backgrounds and show that higher-curvature corrections can be incorporated within the same framework.

 - **Abstract**
 The covariant description of massless particles of arbitrary spin typically employs symmetric tensors of rank $s$ and rests on a local symmetry carried by symmetric tensor parameters of rank $s-1$, suitably generalizing the $U(1)$ transformations of Maxwell's theory and the diffeomorphisms underlying general relativity. Here we show that Fronsdal's action is actually uniquely identified by the weaker requirement of invariance under higher-derivative gauge transformations driven by a vector parameter. This observation may hint to a tighter, if unexpected, connection between higher-spin symmetry and diffeomorphisms.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the computation of the shear viscosity to entropy ratio $\eta/s$ at finite chemical potential in a holographic model that takes into account the quantum fluctuations in the IR region of near-extremal black branes. Such quantum corrections can be computed from JT gravity and generate non-trivial temperature dependence for $\eta/s$, which deviates from the universal $1/4\pi$ result. In the semi-classical regime, $\eta/s$ attains a minimum which is below the KSS bound, generated by the presence of the quantum effects. In the quantum regime at lower temperatures, $\eta/s$ increases and is well above the KSS bound. We also compare the shear viscosity to the quantum-corrected absorption cross-section of near-extremal black holes, and find agreement.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider two-point functions of light fields at finite temperature and large real frequencies in holographic theories. The thermal system is dual to a single-sided AdS black hole. We show that the high-frequency expansion obtained from the Operator Product Expansion receives nonperturbative corrections, which are controlled by null geodesics bouncing off the black hole singularity in the two-sided eternal black hole geometry. We develop a bulk WKB description of these bouncing geodesics and explain how to calculate reflection coefficients at the singularity.
