#### Spatially Offset Active Galactic Nuclei in the Very Large Array Sky Survey: Tracers of Galaxy Mergers and Wandering Massive Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 The remnants of galaxy mergers may host multiple off-nuclear massive black holes (MBHs), some of which may wander indefinitely within the host galaxy halos. Tracing the population of offset MBHs is essential for understanding how the distribution of MBHs in the Universe evolves through galaxy mergers, the efficiency of binary MBH formation, and the rates at which MBHs are seeded in low-mass satellite galaxies. Offset MBHs can be observationally traced if they are accreting and detectable as spatially offset active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this work, we build the largest uniform sample of spatially offset AGN candidates (328) by matching sources from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) to galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Based on the radio source surface density, 29+/-3% are unrelated chance projections. The offset AGN occupation fraction is positively correlated with host galaxy stellar mass, consistent with predictions that most offset MBHs will reside in massive halos. However, this trend vanishes, and may reverse, at the lowest stellar masses, potentially reflecting the weaker host galaxy gravitational potentials. The offset AGN occupation fraction shows no significant evolution with orbital radius, and the agreement with predictions suggests a binary MBH formation rate of <0.5 per merger. Finally, for offset MBHs down to masses of 10^5 Solar masses, the occupation fraction is ~30-70 times lower than the expected value assuming all accreted satellites host a MBH. This result may suggest a relatively low MBH seeding efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first infrared spectral predictions from a self-consistent simulation of the formation of a quasar in a starburst galaxy, spanning cosmological to innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) scales. The infrared emission is dominated by a torus-like dust structure composed of the highly magnetized, turbulence-supported outer accretion disk and of accreting gas tidally torn from the interstellar medium (ISM). At these early stages, the AGN is buried and Compton-thick. The near- to mid-IR escaping luminosity varies by almost an order of magnitude across sightlines, largely due to extinction from the inflowing stream of cold dust. Self-absorption within the torus suppresses silicate emission features, and further reprocessing by the ambient ISM leads to prominent silicate absorption and colder IR emission. The sublimation structure is stratified by composition and size, producing sightline-dependent extinction curves that intrinsically vary in shape. However, after repeated scattering in the optically thick dusty medium, these curves emerge substantially grayed. We also demonstrate that bipolar outflows from the central black hole that carve biconical cavities and reveal the central engine in later stages can preserve IR anisotropy and silicate features. These results suggest that dusty starburst quasars can undergo a buried, IR-bright phase early in their evolution.

#### The Last Stand Before Rubin: a consolidated sample of strong lensing systems in wide-field surveys

 - **Abstract**
 As the Vera Rubin Observatory begins its ten-year survey in 2025, it will probe key observables such as strong lensing (SL) by galaxies and clusters. In preparation for this new era, we assemble an extensive compilation of SL candidate systems from the literature, comprising over 30,000 unique objects that can be used as a watch list of known systems. By cross-matching this sample with photometric and spectroscopic catalogs, we construct two value-added tables containing key parameters for SL analysis, including lens and source redshifts and lens velocity dispersions $\sigma_v$. As a preparation for Rubin, we generate image cutouts for these systems in existing wide-field surveys with subarcsecond seeing, namely CFHTLens, CS82, RCSLens, KiDS, HSC, DES, and DESI Legacy. This sample, dubbed the "Last Stand Before Rubin" (LaStBeRu), has a myriad of applications, from using archival data to selections for follow-up projects and training of machine learning algorithms. As an application, we perform a test of General Relativity using these data, combining the effects of motion of massless particles (through SL modeling) and non-relativistic bodies through $\sigma_v$, which allow one to set constraints on the Post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$. Using the LaStBeRu database, we present an independent test of $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$ (distinct from previous analyses) and, for the first time, we present such a test exclusively with systems identifiable in ground-based images. By combining these data with the previously published samples, we obtain the most stringent constraint on $\gamma_\mathrm{PPN}$. Our results are consistent with GR at the $\sim$~1-$\sigma$ level and with the previous results from the literature.

#### Trends in the Population of Binary Black Holes Following the Fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog: a Data-Driven Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 Current population models of binary black hole distributions are difficult to interpret because standard population inferences hinge on modeling choices, which can mask or mimic real structure. The maximum population likelihood ``$\pistroke$ formalism'' provides a means to investigate and interpret features in the distribution of binary black holes using only data -- without specifying a population model. It tells us if features inferred from current population models are truly present in the data or if they arise from model misspecification. It also provides guidance for developing new models by highlighting previously unnoticed features. In this study, we utilize the $\pistroke$ formalism to examine the binary black hole population in the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4). Our analysis supports the existence of a gap around $45\,M_\odot$ in the secondary black hole mass distribution and identifies a widening in the distribution of the effective inspiral spin parameter $\chi_\text{eff}$ near this mass as recently reported by Tong et al. (2025). Similar to earlier studies, we find support for an anti-correlation between $\chi_\text{eff}$ and mass ratio. However, we argue that this may be a spurious correlation arising from misspecification of the joint distribution of black hole masses. Furthermore, we identify support for dimensionless black hole spin magnitudes at approximately $\chi \approx 0.2$ and $\chi\approx0.7$. The data support the existence of a correlation between the spin magnitudes $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$, though subsequent study is required to determine if this feature is statistically significant. The accompanying data release includes $\pistroke$ samples, which can be used to compare theoretical predictions to LVK data and to assess assumptions in parameterised models.

#### Interaction between disk and extended corona in general relativistic framework. I. Static slab corona in global energy balance with the underlying disk

 - **Abstract**
 The energy equilibrium between the corona and the underlying disk in a two-phase accretion flow sets a lower limit on the achievable photon index. A slab corona may not explain the hard state observations of X-ray binaries (XRBs). We incorporate energy feedback to the accretion disk resulting from illumination by an extended corona, and vice versa. The interaction between these two components allows for the possibility of finding an energetically self-consistent equilibrium solution for a given disk-corona system. We have upgraded the existing Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, MONK, to incorporate the interaction between the disk and the extended corona within the general relativistic framework. We introduce an albedo parameter to specify the fraction of the incident flux that is reflected by the disk, while the remainder is absorbed and added to the intrinsic dissipation. Reflection is modeled assuming a semi-infinite electron atmosphere. We find global equilibrium solutions by iterating interaction between disk and extended slab corona. A higher black hole spin, higher coronal temperature, and higher albedo all lead to harder spectra. For typical coronal temperatures and disk albedo, the lowest achievable photon index with a static slab corona fully covering the disk is approximately 1.7-1.8. With the upgraded version of MONK, we are now able to achieve global energy equilibrium for a given disk-corona system. This approach holds significant potential for constraining the coronal geometry using not only the observed flux but also polarization. A static slab does not appear to be a favorable coronal geometry for the hard state of XRBs, even when global energy balance is taken into account. In future work, we will explore truncated disk geometries and outflowing coronae as potential alternatives. (shortened)

 - **Abstract**
 High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) are systems in which a neutron star or black hole accretes material from a massive companion. HMXBs are expected to have experienced a supernova in their evolution. The impulsive kick associated with this event should affect the space velocity of the system in a way that depends on the nature and state of the progenitor binary. Here, we test whether the different evolutionary histories of HMXBs have left a detectable imprint on their peculiar velocities ($V_{\rm pec}$). Using data from Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3), we first calculate the $V_{\rm pec}$ values for 63 well-known HMXBs hosting a black hole or neutron star and estimate the associated uncertainties via Monte Carlo re-sampling. We then analyse their distribution and check for differences between classes. Overall, $V_{\rm pec}$ estimates extend up to 100 km s$^{-1}$, but with Be/X-ray binaries (BeXRBs) favouring $V_{\rm pec}$ $\lesssim 40$ km s$^{-1}$ and supergiant X-ray binaries (SgXRBs) favouring $V_{\rm pec}$ $\gtrsim 40$ km s$^{-1}$. Based on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, the null hypothesis that the peculiar velocities of both classes are drawn from the same parent distribution can be robustly rejected, irrespective of the background stellar velocity dispersion. Tests with binary population synthesis demonstrate that SgXRBs typically have shorter orbital periods and higher fractional mass loss than BeXRBs at supernova. We argue that the magnitude of $V_{\rm pec}$ could be used as a complementary feature to distinguish between Be and supergiant systems. These findings extend previous inferences based on two-dimensional kinematics from Hipparcos, and may be explained by the differing nature of the respective progenitors systems between the source classes at the instant of supernova.

#### Stellar populations of quasar host galaxies with MFICA decomposition

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy evolution theories require co-evolution between accreting supermassive black holes (SMBH) and galaxies to explain many properties of the local galaxy population, yet observational evidence for the mechanisms driving this co-evolution is lacking. The recent star-formation histories of the host galaxies of accreting SMBHs (Active Galactic Nuclei, AGNs) can help constrain the processes that feed SMBHs and halt star formation in galaxies, but are difficult to obtain for the most luminous AGNs (quasars). We introduce Mean-Field Independent Component Analysis (MFICA) to decompose quasar spectra and obtain recent star formation histories of their host galaxies. Applying MFICA to quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 Quasar Catalogue in the redshift range $0.16 \leq z \leq 0.76$, we find that 53 per cent of quasar host galaxies are star-forming, 17 per cent lie in the green-valley, while only 5 per cent are quiescent. This contrasts with 14, 11, and 74 per cent of a mass-matched control sample that are star-forming, green-valley, and quiescent, respectively. We find that $\sim25$ per cent of quasars are hosted by post-starburst galaxies, an excess of $28\pm1$ compared to our control sample. While the heterogeneity of recent star formation histories implies multiple SMBH feeding mechanisms, the excess of post-starburst host galaxies demonstrates the link between accreting SMBHs and a recent starburst followed by rapid quenching. Given that massive post-starburst galaxies are predominantly caused by gas-rich major mergers, our results indicate that $30-50$ per cent of quasars originate from merger-induced starbursts.

 - **Abstract**
 Jets from accreting black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRBs) are powerful outflows that release a large fraction of the accretion energy to the surrounding environment, providing a feedback mechanism that may alter the interstellar medium (ISM) properties. Studying accretion and feedback together enables estimates of matter and energy input/output around accreting BHs. We focus on the extended jet structures of the BH-XRB GRS1758-258. First seen in VLA data, these parsec-scale jets arise from jet-ISM interaction and show a Z-shaped morphology. Using the MeerKAT telescope we observed GRS1758-258 in L-band for a total exposure of 7 hr. Applying a calorimetry-based method developed for AGN and later used for XRBs, we estimated the properties of the jets and of the surrounding ISM. We detect a jet and counter-jet terminating in bow-shocks. Within the northern jet lobe we identify synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission, while the southern lobe is dominated by thermal emission. We measure ISM densities between 10-40 cm-3 across both jets, slightly lower in the northern region. The estimated ages of the two lobes range from 6-51 kyr. The time-averaged jet power lies between 4.4x10^33 and 3.3x10^36 erg/s, with differences between north and south likely due to different local ISM conditions. Comparing new MeerKAT with archival VLA data, we measured a proper motion of 130 mas/yr in a portion of the northern jet. Jet-ISM interaction structures on both sides of GRS1758-258 reveal different ISM properties. The comparison between these structures and those from other XRBs suggests that the lobes in GRS1758-258 are younger and may result from different jet activity phases. The time-averaged energy transferred to the environment is slightly lower than in other XRBs, consistent with the younger age of the lobes in GRS1758-258 relative to those of other systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.

 - **Abstract**
 As the compact binary catalog continues to grow rapidly, developing and refining tests to probe the nature of compact objects is essential for a comprehensive understanding of both the observed data and the underlying astrophysics of the binary population. We investigate the effectiveness of spin-induced multipole moments (SIQM) and tidal deformability measurements in distinguishing lower mass-gap black hole (BH) binaries from non-BH binaries with different mass and spin configurations. We perform model-agnostic tests on binary BH (BBH) simulations using full Bayesian inference, evaluating the independent and joint measurability of SIQM and tidal parameters across the parameter space. We extend the analysis to simulations of self-interacting spinning boson stars, using synthetic signals that exhibit (a) both SIQM and tidal effects and (b) each effect individually. For case (a), recovery is performed using (i) a BBH model, (ii) a model incorporating both SIQM and tidal effects, and (iii) models including either SIQM or tidal effects. For case (b), we employ (i) a BBH model and (ii) models incorporating either SIQM or tidal effects, consistent with the injection. Simulations employ TaylorF2 waveform model and consider binaries in the low mass gap with varying spin magnitudes. We find that employing an incorrect model to analyze the signal can lead to biases in parameter inference. Notably, when analyzing a simulated binary boson star-like signal with component masses $\rm{(4, 4) \, M_{\odot}}$ using a BBH model, the system is incorrectly identified as having masses $\rm{(8, 2) \, M_{\odot}}$. In contrast, using the correct recovery model that includes both SIQM and tidal deformability effects successfully recovers the true masses, highlighting the significance of waveform model accuracy in performing reliable distinguishability tests for compact objects in the low-mass gap.

#### Primordial Black Hole Formation in a Scalar Field Dominated Universe: Investigation of the Critical nature of the Collapse

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the critical collapse leading to primordial black hole (PBH) formation in a universe dominated by a self-interacting scalar field with a quartic potential, comparing it to the well-known radiation-dominated case. Using fully relativistic nonlinear numerical simulations in spherical symmetry, based on the Misner--Sharp formalism, we analyze the dynamics near the collapse threshold and track the scaling of the black hole mass. Our results confirm that both the scalar field and radiation cases exhibit type II critical behavior with similar -- though not identical -- critical exponents, differing by about $2\sigma$. This suggests that, while a quartic scalar field effectively mimics a radiation fluid even in the nonlinear collapse regime, small differences in the critical exponent persist. Our findings provide direct numerical evidence for the near universality of the critical exponent in PBH formation, with only mild dependence on whether the collapse is driven by a scalar field or a perfect fluid.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite the remarkable success of the standard LambdaCDM model in describing the evolution of the universe, several unresolved issues remain, such as the true nature of dark energy, fine-tuning problems, and the persistent Hubble tension. Motivated by these shortcomings, we construct a spinor field-based Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) model that unifies dark matter and dark energy within a spherically symmetric Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. This framework incorporates a nonlinear spinor field and considers an open universe geometry. We constrain the model parameters using the latest observational datasets, including Type Ia supernovae from the binned Pantheon compilation, Hubble parameter measurements from cosmic chronometers (CC) and SDSS, including baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data. Employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques, we obtain best-fit values that indicate the spinor GCG model provides a competitive and viable alternative to the LambdaCDM, particularly in the late-time universe. Furthermore, the model predicts a lower present-day Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. The results highlight the rich phenomenology of spinor fields and their possible role in the dynamics of dark energy through spacetime interaction.

#### Gravitational lensing by Lema\^ıtre-Tolman-Bondi wormholes in a Friedmann universe

 - **Abstract**
 The Lema\^ıtre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) solution to the Einstein equations describes the dynamics of a self-gravitating spherically symmetric dust cloud with an arbitrary density profile and any distribution of initial velocities, encoded in three arbitrary functions $f(R)$, $F(R)$, and $\tau_0(R)$, where $R$ is a radial coordinate in the comoving reference frame. A particular choice of these functions corresponds to a wormhole geometry with a throat defined as a sphere of minimum radius at a fixed time instant. In this paper we explore LTB wormholes and discuss their possible observable appearance studying in detail the effects of gravitational lensing by such objects. For this aim, we study photon motion in wormhole space-time inscribed in a closed Friedmann dustfilled universe and find the wormhole shadow as it could be seen by a distant observer. Since the LTB wormhole is a dynamic object, we analyze the dependence of its shadow size on the observation time and on the initial size of the wormhole region. We reveal that the angular size of the shadow exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the observation time. At early times, the shadow size decreases as photons with smaller angular momentum gradually reach the observer. At later times, the expansion of the Friedmann Universe becomes a dominant factor that leads to an increase in the shadow size.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09986

 - **Abstract**
 This work explores the prospect of using the plunge to identify potential black hole mimickers. We show that the plunge excites two generic spectral features. (i) At low frequencies, there is a comb of sharp resonances at the real parts of the mimicker quasi-normal modes. (ii) Above a threshold $M\omega_{\rm th}\!\approx\!0.39$ (for the dominant mode), the spectrum undergoes a qualitative break: with the black hole mimicker displaying significant deviations from the black hole. Though individual plunge SNRs in extreme mass ratio events are low and detecting them in a sea of noise is difficult, the coherent spectral features identified here may allow for enhancing the SNR by using multiple events.

 - **Abstract**
 We have investigated the cosmological consequences of the model in the recently developed gravity theory [Haghani and Harko, \textit{Eur. Phys. J. C} \textbf{81} (2021) 615.] using a non-linear form of the $f(R,T,L_{m})$ function and the latest observational datasets. For flat Friedman-Lema\^ıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime and $f(R,T,L_{m})= \alpha\,R+\beta\,RT+\gamma\,RL_{m}-\eta$ with $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\eta$ as coupling constants, we have solved the modified field equations to get the Hubble function $H(z)$ in terms of $H_{0}$, $\Omega_{m0}$, $\Omega_{r0}$, $\Omega_{\eta}$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$. To ensure that the model is consistent with the physically observed universe, we constrained the model parameters using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis on joint datasets of cosmic chronometer and Pantheon samples. Using these approximated model parameter values, we investigated the universe's cosmic evolution history, including the deceleration parameter, effective equation of state, dark energy equation of state, total dark energy density parameters, universe age, and so on. In addition, to assess the physical acceptability and stability of the generated model, we conducted the Om diagnostic test, causality test, and energy conditions test.

 - **Abstract**
 The future space-based gravitational wave observatory LISA is expected to detect massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), ranging up to thousands. Such high-precision observations require accurate modeling of the detector response. However, current derivations of the response function neglect the motion of the spacecraft during light travel time, omitting velocity-dependent terms of order $\beta = v/c \sim 10^{-4}$. In this work, we derive the velocity-dependent corrections to the gravitational wave response. We analyze the contribution of the velocity-terms for MBHBs in the mass range $[10^6,10^8]\:\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ using a modified version of the state-of-the-art response simulator lisagwresponse. We find that corrections introduce residual SNRs up to $\sim 2$ for the loudest events and fractional differences up to $0.04\%$, compared to lisagwresponse. While small, these effects are comparable to current waveform modeling uncertainties and imprint distinctive sky-localization signatures, making them potentially relevant for parameter estimation of high-mass MBHBs and simulation of mock datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 Complex states of quantum gravity in flat and AdS gravity can have features that are inaccessible to classical asymptotic observers. The missing information appears to such observers to be hidden behind a horizon or in a baby universe. Here we use the gravitational path integral to ask whether quantum observables can access the hidden data. We show that generic probes give a universal result and contain no information about the state. However, a probe appropriately fine-tuned to the state can give a large signal because of novel wormhole saddles in the path integral. Thus, in these settings, asymptotic observers cannot easily determine the state of the universe, but can check a proposal for it. Using these fine-tuned probes we show that an asymptotic observer can detect information hidden in a disconnected baby universe. Furthermore we show that the state of a two-boundary black hole can be detected using Lorentzian operators localised on just one of the boundaries.
