 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the basic cosmological effects of a population of timelike boundaries -- a form of nontrivial spacetime topology -- containing a boundary layer of quantum stress energy. This accumulation of vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields can be consistently negative and UV sensitive, providing an additional source of cosmic energy density strong enough to compete with matter and dark energy. For boundary conditions enabling a solution with fixed comoving boundary size, this effect contributes a qualitatively new term to the Friedmann equation determining the expansion history, scaling like $-1/a$ for scale factor $a$. It naturally dominates at relatively late times ($a\approx1/2$), while leaving intact well-measured early universe physics such as big bang nucleosynthesis and recombination. For a wide window of parameters, the boundaries can be larger than the Planck length throughout their history, back through the start of inflation at any viable scale. We analyze CMB and BAO data sets (Planck, ACT, and DESI) allowing for this component, finding a slight preference ($\sim 2\sigma$) and a relaxation of current tensions in the data (including the neutrino mass) in a physical manner. This novel parameter fits into a larger space of physical parameters beyond-$\Lambda$CDM that may serve this role, including negative spatial curvature, which may also be motivated by topological considerations and chaotic dynamics. Finally, we comment on additional phenomenological prospects for testing for this form of topology in the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 The effective-field theory based full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors (EFT-SBP) is the novel analysis of galaxy clustering data that allows one to combine merits of perturbation theory and simulation-based modeling in a unified framework. In this paper we use EFT-SBP with the galaxy clustering power spectrum and bispectrum data from BOSS in order to test the recent preference for dynamical dark energy reported by the DESI collaboration. While dynamical dark energy is preferred by the combination of DESI baryon acoustic oscillation, \textit{Planck} Cosmic Microwave Background, and Pantheon+ supernovae data, we show that this preference disappears once these data sets are combined with the usual BOSS EFT galaxy power spectrum and bispectrum likelihood. The use of the simulation-based priors in this analysis further weakens the case for dynamical dark energy by additionally shrinking the parameter posterior around the cosmological constant region. Specifically, the figure of merit of the dynamical dark energy constraints from the combined data set improves by $\approx 20\%$ over the usual EFT-full-shape analysis with the conservative priors. These results are made possible with a novel modeling approach to the EFT prior distribution with the Gaussian mixture models, which allows us to both accurately capture the EFT priors and retain the ability to analytically marginalize the likelihood over most of the EFT nuisance parameters. Our results challenge the dynamical dark energy interpretation of the DESI data and enable future EFT-SBP analyses of BOSS and DESI in the context of non-minimal cosmological models.

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the matter distribution in the universe through the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest allows us to constrain small-scale physics in the high-redshift regime. Spectroscopic quasar surveys are generating increasingly large datasets that require efficient algorithms to compute correlation functions. Moreover, cosmological analyses based on Lyman-$\alpha$ forests can significantly benefit from incorporating higher-order statistics alongside traditional two-point correlations. In this work, we present Lya2pcf, a pipeline designed to compute three-dimensional two-point and three-point correlation functions using Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data. The code implements standard algorithms widely used in current spectroscopic surveys for computing the two-point correlation function with its distortion matrix, covariance matrices; and it naturally extends the two-point estimator to three-point correlations. Thanks to GPU optimization, Lya2pcf achieves a substantial reduction in computational time for both the two-point correlation function and its distortion matrix when compared to the widely used PICCA code. We apply Lya2pcf to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) sixteenth data release (DR16) and a Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Year-5 (DESI Y5) mock dataset, demonstrating overall performance gains over PICCA, especially on GPUs. We show the first measurement of the anisotropic three-point correlation function on a large spectroscopic sample for all possible triangles with scales up to 80 Mpc/h. The estimator's fast computation and the resulting signal-to-noise ratio -- above one for many triangle configurations -- demonstrate the viability of incorporating three-point statistics into future cosmological inference analyses, particularly with the larger datasets expected from Stage IV spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) hosts 12 known Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs), seven of which apparently single. Their formation is a challenge for current stellar evolution models, because line-driven winds are generally assumed to be quenched at a metallicity Z<0.004. Here, we present a set of MESA models of single stars with zero-age main sequence masses 20-80 M_sun, considering different initial rotation speeds (Omega=0-0.7 Omega_c), metallicities (Z=0.002-0.0045), and wind mass-loss models (optically thin and thick winds). We show that if we account for optically thick winds, as described by Sabhahit+2023, fast rotating (Omega=0.6 Omega_c) single metal-poor O-type stars (with M>20 M_sun) shed their envelope and become WR stars even at the low metallicity of the SMC. The luminosity, effective temperature, evolutionary timescale, surface abundance, and rotational velocity of our simulated WR stars are compatible to the WRs observed in the SMC. We speculate that this scenario can also alleviate the excess of giant stars across the Humphreys-Davidson limit. Our results have key implications for black hole masses, (pair instability) supernova explosions, and other observable signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 Hypervelocity stars are unique objects moving through the Milky Way at speeds exceeding the local escape velocity, providing valuable insights into the Galactic gravitational potential and the properties of its central supermassive black hole. The advent of Gaia DR3 offers an unprecedented astrometric precision, enabling the discovery of new hypervelocity stars and facilitating their characterization. This study seeks to identify and characterize hypervelocity star candidates using Gaia DR3 data, focusing on stars lacking radial velocity measurements. Our goal was to estimate the total velocities of these stars and establish their origin within the Galactic framework, if possible. We applied strict selection criteria to Gaia DR3 data, focusing on sources with low parallax uncertainties and high astrometric fidelity. The distributions of the total velocities in the Galactic rest frame were derived and used to identify candidates. Spectroscopic follow-up with VLT/FORS2 provided radial velocity measurements for a subset of these candidates. We evaluated the probabilities of stars exceeding local escape velocities under different Galactic potential models and traced their past orbits to identify possible origins. From Gaia DR3, we identified 149 hypervelocity star candidates with Pesc > 50% of exceeding local escape velocities. Our follow-up spectroscopy for 23 of those sources confirms that the selected targets are traveling at high velocities, with many appearing to escape the Galaxy, depending on the Galactic potential adopted. Our analysis suggests that nearly one-third of the stars may have an extra-Galactic origin. These findings highlight the need for more precise astrometric and spectroscopic data to conclusively determine the origins of hypervelocity stars and improve models of the Galactic potential.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the feasibility of measuring the cosmic growth-rate parameter, $f\sigma_8$, using peculiar velocities (PVs) derived from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We produce simulations of different SN types using a realistic LSST observing strategy, incorporating noise, photometric detection from the Difference Image Analysis (DIA) pipeline, and a PV field modeled from the Uchuu UniverseMachine simulations. We test three observational scenarios, ranging from ideal conditions with spectroscopic host-galaxy redshifts and spectroscopic SN classification, to more realistic settings involving photometric classification and contamination from non-Ia supernovae. Using a maximum-likelihood technique, we show that LSST can measure $f\sigma_8$ with a precision of $10\%$ in the redshift range $ 0.02 < z < 0.14 $ in the most realistic case. Using three tomographic bins, LSST can constrain the growth-rate parameter with errors below $18\%$ up to $z = 0.14$. We also test the impact of contamination on the maximum likelihood method and find that for contamination fractions below $\sim 2\%$, the measurement remains unbiased. These results highlight the potential of the LSST SN Ia sample to complement redshift-space distortion measurements at high redshift, providing a novel avenue for testing general relativity and dark energy models.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars, called the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly-$\alpha$) forest, is a unique probe of cosmology and the intergalactic medium at high redshifts and small scales. The statistical power of ongoing redshift surveys demands precise theoretical tools to model the Ly-$\alpha$ forest. We address this challenge by developing an analytic, perturbative forward model to predict the Ly-$\alpha$ forest at the field level for a given set of cosmological initial conditions. Our model shows a remarkable performance when compared with the Sherwood hydrodynamic simulations: it reproduces the flux distribution, the Ly-$\alpha$ - dark matter halo cross-correlations, and the count-in-cell statistics at the percent level down to scales of a few Mpc. Our work provides crucial tools that bridge analytic modeling on large scales with simulations on small-scales, enabling field-level inference from Ly-$\alpha$ forest data and simulation-based priors for cosmological analyses. This is especially timely for realizing the full scientific potential of the Ly-$\alpha$ forest measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the radio continuum counterparts to the enigmatic ultra-compact X-ray binaries (UCXBs); a black hole or neutron star accreting from a hydrogen-deficient white dwarf donor star, with short orbital periods ($<$ 80 minutes). For the sample of UCXBs hosted by globular clusters (GCs), we search for whether certain GC properties are more likely to enhance UCXB formation. We determine that GCs which host UCXBs are drawn from a distinct population in terms of cluster concentration, core radius and half-light radius, but are similar to other well-studied GCs in metallicity and cluster mass. In particular, UCXB-hosting GCs tend to be on average more compact, with a higher concentration than other GCs, with significantly higher encounter rates. We investigate whether a correlation exists between radio luminosity and orbital period, using new and archival observations. We determine that there is not a clear connection between the two observable quantities.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the searches conducted with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in response to S250206dm, a bona fide event with a false alarm rate of one in 25 years, detected by the International Gravitational Wave Network (IGWN). Although the event is significant, the nature of the compact objects involved remains unclear, with at least one likely neutron star. ZTF covered 68% of the localization region, though we did not identify any likely optical counterpart. We describe the ZTF strategy, potential candidates, and the observations that helped rule out candidates, including sources circulated by other collaborations. Similar to Ahumada et al. 2024, we perform a frequentist analysis, using simsurvey, as well as Bayesian analysis, using nimbus, to quantify the efficiency of our searches. We find that, given the nominal distance to this event of 373$\pm$104 Mpc, our efficiencies are above 10% for KNe brighter than $-17.5$ absolute magnitude. Assuming the optical counterpart known as kilonova (KN) lies within the ZTF footprint, our limits constrain the brightest end of the KN parameter space. Through dedicated radiative transfer simulations of KNe from binary neutron star (BNS) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers, we exclude parts of the BNS KN parameter space. Up to 35% of the models with high wind ejecta mass ($M_{\rm wind} \approx 0.13$ M$_{\odot}$) are ruled out when viewed face-on ($\cos\theta_{\rm obs} = 1.0$). Finally, we present a joint analysis using the combined coverage from ZTF and the Gravitational Wave Multimessenger Dark Energy Camera Survey (GW-MMADS). The joint observations cover 73% of the localization region, and the combined efficiency has a stronger impact on rising and slowly fading models, allowing us to rule out 55% of the high-mass KN models viewed face-on.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the potential of a cosmological model termed $\Lambda w$DM, in which a cosmological constant play the role of dark energy and dark matter is barotropic and has a constant equation of state parameter ($w_{\rm dm}$), to address the $S_8$ tension between early- and late- universe observations. By incorporating the latest cosmological datasets -- including Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), Redshift Space Distortions (RSD), and weak lensing (WL) -- we constrain the $\Lambda w$DM compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Our analysis reveals a marginal preference for a non-zero $w_{\rm dm}=2.7^{+2.0}_{-1.9}\times10^{-7}$( at 95\% confidence level) when combining CMB, SDSS BAO, SNe Ia, RSD, and WL data, and a marginal preference for a non-zero $w_{\rm dm} = 2.29^{+1.9}_{-2.0} \times 10^{-7}$( at 95\% confidence level) when combining CMB, DESI Y1 BAO, SNe Ia, RSD, and WL data. In addition, we find that, compared to $\Lambda$CDM, $\Lambda w$DM can alleviate the $S_8$ tension from $>3\sigma$ to $<1\sigma$. Furthermore, we find that, for CMB+SDSS+PP+RSD+WL datasets, the $\Lambda w$DM model is close to being positively preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model.
#### Evidence for enhanced mass transfer in the disc preceding the transition to the soft state in MAXI J1820+070

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the 2018-2019 main outburst and the subsequent mini-outbursts of the black hole low-mass X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 using optical/ultraviolet data from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO), the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO), and $\textit{Swift}$/UVOT, as well as X-ray data from $\textit{Insight}$-HXMT and $\textit{Swift}$/XRT. Given the high-cadence observations, we identify a broad dip-like feature in both the optical and X-ray light curves preceding the transition to the soft state, with the X-ray dip lagging the optical dip by approximately 10 days. We propose that the dip is caused by a brief decrease followed by an increase in the mass accretion rate as it propagates through the disc, ultimately triggering the transition to the soft state. This might be a potential tool to predict impending hard-to-soft state transitions, although such a dip has not yet been observed in many sources. Additionally, we find that optical colour ($g^{\prime}-i^{\prime}$) becomes bluer and less variable before the transition to the intermediate state, preceding a dramatic change in the hardness ratio. This appears to be an unusual case, differing from the typical scenario where the optical colour changes usually along with the transition to the soft state. Finally, we explore the implications of the complex evolution of optical/X-ray correlation during both main outbursts and mini-outbursts. In particular, we find a loop-like evolutionary track before the transition to the soft state, which is linked to the optical/X-ray dips in the light curves.
#### A Comprehensive study of time delay between optical/near-infrared and X-ray emissions in black hole X-ray binaries

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a comprehensive study of daily delays using multi-wavelength data from a sample of well-studied black hole X-ray binaries, specifically focusing on the sources GX 339-4, 4U 1543-47, and XTE J1550-564. The Interpolated-Correlation Function method was employed to investigate the temporal relationship between the X-ray (Compton component) and optical-infrared (OIR) emissions. Our results show that during the rising hard state, the Compton emission consistently lags behind OIR emission for several days. In contrast, during the decaying hard state, the OIR emission lags behind the Compton emission by approximately 6 to 35 days. This measurement can potentially be used in models of accretion physics and disk instability. We explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for these time delays, highlighting the critical role of viscous heating in the accretion disk in generating OIR luminosity for these sources. The observed time delays during both the rising and decaying hard states are well explained by the disk instability model.

 - **Abstract**
 One important question in active galactic nucleus (AGN) is how gas is brought down to the galaxy center. Both internal secular evolution (torque induced by non-axisymmetric galactic structures such as bars) and external processes (e.g. mergers or interactions) are expected to redistribute the angular momentum (AM) and transport gas inward. However, it is still under debate whether these processes can significantly affect AGN activities. Here we for the first time report that AGN fraction increases with the difference of kinematic position angles ($\Delta PA\equiv|PA_{\mathrm{gas}}-PA_{\mathrm{star}}|$) between ionized gas ($PA_{\mathrm{gas}}$) and stellar disks ($PA_{\mathrm{star}}$) in blue and green galaxies, meanwhile this fraction remains roughly constant for red galaxies. Also the high luminosity AGN fraction increases with $\Delta PA$ while the low luminosity AGN fraction is independent with $\Delta PA$. These observational results support a scenario in which the interaction between accreted and pre-existing gas provides the AM loss mechanism, thereby the gas inflow fuels the central BH activities, and the AM loss efficiency is positively correlated with the $\Delta PA$.

 - **Abstract**
 The precise calculation of gravitational wave (GW) and particle emissions from cosmic string networks is of significant theoretical and experimental interest. In this Letter, we perform numerical simulations of near-global and local string networks, comparing the GW spectra predictions from both lattice field simulation and the Nambu-Goto (NG) approximation methods. We find the discrepancy between the GW spectra computed via the NG approximation and the lattice field simulation is negligible for near-global string and grow with increasing gauge coupling. Additionally, we confirm that particle emission significantly dominates energy emission, with the ratio of GW energy to particle energy approximately $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ for both near-global and local string scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultralight dark matter refers to the lightest potential dark matter candidates. We will focus on the mass range that has been studied using astrophysical and cosmological observations, corresponding to a mass $10^{-24} \, \mathrm{eV} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-18} \, \mathrm{eV}$. We will discuss the motivations for this mass range. The most studied model in this range corresponds to a minimally coupled, single, classical, spin-0 field comprising all dark matter. However, the work exploring extensions of this model (for example, higher spin, self-coupled, multiple field, and mixed models) will be one of the focuses of this review. The phenomenology associated with ultralight dark matter is rich and includes linear effects on the primordial power spectrum, core structures forming at the center of halos, nonlinear effects resulting in heating of stellar distributions, and non-relativistic effects relating to pulsar signals and black hole superradiance, to name a few. This set of effects has been studied using an equally extensive set of numerical tools. We will summarize the most common ones and discuss their applications and limitations. Ultralight dark matter also has a wide variety of observational constraints, including halo mass functions, the Lyman-alpha forest, halo density profiles, stellar dynamics, and black hole spins. We will review them focusing on the observations made, the method of study, and the major systematics. We will end with a discussion of the current status of the field and future work needed.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates using five years of microlensing data from the OGLE survey. While the majority of OGLE's $\sim 2000$ microlensing events are well-explained by stellar populations such as brown dwarfs, main-sequence stars, and compact remnants, a subset of six ultrashort-timescale events ($t_E \sim 0.1 - 0.3$ days) may signal the presence of PBHs. Building upon prior work that adopted the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM profile, we examine how alternative DM halo models -- specifically the Einasto and Burkert profiles -- affect microlensing predictions and the constraints on PBH abundance. We computed differential microlensing event rates for both profiles, using the main-sequence star rate as an observational benchmark. Our results show that neither the Einasto nor Burkert profiles reproduce the distribution of main-sequence star events, yet both allow for viable explanations of the ultrashort-timescale events with PBH masses $M_{\mathrm{PBH}} \sim 10^{-5} M_\odot$. Using a Poisson likelihood analysis under the null hypothesis that no PBH is observed in OGLE dataset, we derive 95\% C.L. upper bounds on $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}$, finding that the constraints are significantly relaxed under the Einasto and Burkert profiles compared to the NFW case. These results underscore the sensitivity of PBH constraints to the assumed DM halo structure and highlight the importance of accurately modeling the inner Galactic density profile to robustly assess PBH dark matter scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 As an update on the initial findings of DESI, the new results provide the first hint of potential deviations from a cosmological constant ($w=-1$), which, if confirmed with significance $>5\sigma$, will falsify the $\Lambda$CDM model. We consider a novel generalised form of an emergent dark energy model and confront this through various data sets (Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release (DESI DR2), Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) compilation, and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors) and simultaneously constrain the dark energy (DE) equation of state and energy density $f_{DE}(z)$. The results for the joint posteriors of cosmological parameters and the reconstructed dark energy EoS $w(z)$ with the energy density $f_{DE}(z)$ for various combinations of data sets are discussed, which favors quintessence nature. Specifically, $w(0) = -0.820$ with DESI DR2 + CMB, $-0.845$ with DESI DR2 + CMB + PP$^+$, $-0.828$ with DESI DR2 + CMB + Union3, and $-0.804$ with DESI DR2 + CMB + DESY5. We adopted a novel method to probe shifts in the generalized emergent dark energy (GEDE) parameter ($\Delta$) by mapping 2D marginalized posterior distributions in the $\Delta-\Omega_{m0}$ plane. Our analysis consistently reveals a preference for negative $\Delta$ across multiple combinations of observational datasets. Incorporating these values into the matter power spectrum further supports the GEDE framework's viability. We quantify the model's performance using the Bayes factor.

 The existence of billion-solar-mass quasars at redshifts $z \gtrsim 7$ poses a formidable challenge to theories of black hole formation, requiring pathways for the rapid growth of massive seeds. Population III.1 stars, forming in pristine, dense dark matter (DM) minihalos, are compelling progenitors. This study presents a suite of stellar evolution models for accreting Pop III.1 protostars, calculated with the \textsc{GENEC} code. We systematically explore a wide parameter space, spanning ambient WIMP densities of $\rho_\chi \sim 10^{12}\mbox{-}10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$ and gas accretion rates of $10^{-3}\mbox{-}10^{-1}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, to quantify the effects of DM annihilation. A central finding is that for a protostar to grow to supermassive scales ($\gtrsim 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$), the ambient DM density in the immediate vicinity of the star must exceed a critical threshold of $\rho_{\chi} \gtrsim 5 \times 10^{14} \, \text{GeV cm}^{-3}$. The energy injected by WIMP annihilation inflates the protostar, lowering its surface temperature, which suppresses the ionizing feedback that would otherwise halt accretion and significantly delays the onset of hydrogen fusion. This heating also governs the star's final fate: in dense halos ($\rho_\chi \gtrsim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$), stars remain stable against general relativistic instability beyond $10^6 \, M_{\odot}$, whereas at lower densities ($\rho_\chi \lesssim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$), they collapse at masses of $\sim 5 \times 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$. Once the DM fuel is exhausted and core burning commences, the protostar contracts and its ionising photon output can reach very high levels $\sim 10^{53} s^{-1}$. These distinct evolutionary phases offer clear observational signatures for the JWST, providing a robust, physically-grounded pathway for forming heavy black hole seeds in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the brightest electromagnetic bursts in the universe, are believed to originate from ultra-relativistic jets launched by the rapidly rotating central engine, either a disk-surrounded newly formed black hole (BH) or a magnetar. Such a central engine potentially possesses rapidly evolving physical characteristics, as it is just born. The caught of time-increasing frequency in the gravitational wave signals is the evidence of upon opinion. Here we report a possible oscillatory signal identified in GRB 131122B with periods increasing from 1.27 seconds to 4.02 seconds in a time interval of 16.75 seconds. Such a peculiar oscillation signal has not been identified in GRBs before and its periodic evolution could also be the quickest one found in the electromagnetic radiation window of astrophysics. The precession of a misaligned accretion disk caused by the tidal disruption of a star by an intermediate-mass BH may be responsible for this signal. This finding could open a new window to reveal the nature of the hiding central engine of GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we perform reconstruction of \( f(Q) \) gravity inspired by the New Agegraphic Dark Energy (NADE) model, aiming to account for the Universe's late time acceleration without invoking a cosmological constant. Utilizing a power law scale factor \( a(t) = a_0 t^h \), we derive an analytic form for \( f(Q) \) based on a correspondence with NADE, where the conformal time serves as the infrared cutoff. The resulting model naturally recovers General Relativity in the limit and exhibits a geometrically motivated dark energy component. We constrain the model parameters using recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR2 BAO and previous BAO observations through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The reconstructed Hubble parameter \( H(z) \) demonstrates excellent agreement with observational data, achieving high \( R^2 \) values and low \(\chi^2_{\min}\), AIC, and BIC scores, outperforming the standard \( \Lambda \)CDM model. Further, we investigate the cosmological evolution using the deceleration parameter \( q(z) \), effective equation of state \( \omega_{\mathrm{eff}}(z) \), and Om diagnostics. The model exhibits a clear transition from deceleration to acceleration with a present value \( q(0) \in \left[-0.5879, -0.3333\right] \) and transition redshift $z_{\mathrm{tr}} \sim 0.5209-0.8126$, while maintaining \( -1 < \omega_{\mathrm{eff}}(z) < -1/3 \), indicating quintessence like behavior. Om diagnostics consistently show a negative slope, further confirming deviation from \( \Lambda \)CDM. Energy condition analysis reveals that WEC, DEC, and NEC are satisfied, while SEC is violated only at low redshifts which is consistent with cosmic acceleration. Overall, the reconstructed \( f(Q) \) model provides a viable, observationally consistent, and theoretically motivated alternative to standard dark energy scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 The Schwarzschild solution describes a classical static black hole in general relativity. When general relativity is extended by including semiclassical corrections in the form of a renormalized energy-momentum tensor, the horizon of the Schwarzschild black hole disappears and is replaced by a wormhole. We study the stability of this quantum corrected static Schwarzschild solution in semiclassical gravity by using it as the initial data of a dynamical evolution. We find that the quantum corrected solution is unstable and that the wormhole can expand or collapse when perturbed. In vacuum, the wormhole expands, but in the presence of even a small amount of classical matter, the wormhole collapses, forming a horizon and evolving to an evaporating black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present 52 new numerical-relativity (NR) simulations of black-hole-neutron-star merger (BHNS) mergers and employ the data to inform TEOBResumS-Dalí: a multipolar effective-one-body model also including precession and eccentricity. Our simulations target quasicircular mergers and the parameter space region characterized by significant tidal disruption of the star. Convergent gravitational waveforms are produced with a detailed error budget after extensive numerical tests. We study in detail the multipolar amplitude hierarchy and identify a characteristic tidal signature in the $(\ell,m)=(2,0)$, and $(3,0)$ modes. We also develop new NR-informed models for the remnant black hole and for the recoil velocity. The numerical data is then used to inform next-to-quasicircular corrections and the ringdown of TEOBResumS-Dalí for BHNS. We show an overall order of magnitude improvement in the waveform's amplitude at merger and more consistent multipoles over our older TEOBResumS-GIOTTO for BHNS. TEOBResumS-Dalí is further validated with a new 12 orbit precessing simulation, showing phase and relative amplitude differences below $\sim 0.5$ (rad) throughout the inspiral. The computed mismatches including all the modes lie at the one percent level for low inclinations. Finally, we demonstrate for the first time that TEOBResumS-Dalí can produce robust waveforms with both eccentricity and precession, and use the model to identify the most urgent BHNS to simulate for waveform development. Our new numerical data are publicly released as part of the CoRe database.

 - **Abstract**
 Eccentric binaries are key targets for current and future gravitational wave (GW) detectors, offering unique insights into the formation and environments of compact binaries. However, accurately and efficiently modeling eccentric waveforms remains challenging, in part due to their complex harmonic structure. In this work, we develop a post-Newtonian (PN) framework to compute the Fourier amplitudes of GWs from eccentric binaries, deriving simple expressions at 1PN order for all relevant $(l, m)$ multipoles, valid for arbitrary eccentricities. We then characterize the GW emission by analyzing the contribution of each $(l, m)$ mode to the strain, its mean frequency, frequency spread, and asymptotic behavior at high frequencies. Additionally, we introduce a method to determine the minimal set of Fourier modes needed to reconstruct the waveform to a given accuracy. Finally, we also discuss how our framework can be extended to higher PN orders, obtaining closed-form expressions for the leading-order tail and spin contributions and outlining the steps required to include higher-order corrections. Our results provide both a deeper theoretical understanding of eccentric GW emission and practical tools for developing more accurate and efficient waveform models.

 In this talk, we review recent results in testing spacetime symmetries in gravitational physics. Topics discussed include new signals for hypothetical Lorentz and diffeomorphism symmetry violations in short-range gravity tests. We review results for multipole expansions that predict extra polarizations for gravitational waves. Both explicit and spontaneous spacetime-symmetry breaking origins are considered. We also discuss recent numerical results for black hole solutions in a vector field model of spontaneous symmetry breaking.
#### Cosmological implications of hybrid metric-Palatini $f(\mathcal{R},\mc{R}_{μν}\mc{R}^{μν})$ gravity

 - **Abstract**
 The hybrid metric-Palatini gravity with Lagrangian density $L =R+f(\mathcal{R},\mc{R}_{\mu\nu}\mc{R}^{\mu\nu})$ is considered, where $R$ is the metric Ricci scalar and $\mc{R}_{\mu\nu}$ is the Palatini Ricci tensor. Contrary to the standard hybrid metric-Palatini theory, because of the term $\mathcal{R}_{\mu\nu}\mathcal{R}^{\mu\nu}$ in the action, the model can not be analytically transformed to a scalar-tensor theory. However, on top of a maximally symmetric space-times like the FRW universe, there is a way to solve for a metric compatible connection which we will follow in this paper. The cosmological implications of the resulting model will then be fully considered. The best fit values of the model and cosmological parameters will be obtained by confronting the model with the recent observational data on the Hubble parameter. We will see that the observational data can be explained very good in this model, but, significant deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model could be seen in derivatives of the Hubble parameter $q$, $j$ and $s$. We will perform a statefinder analysis for the model and show that its behavior differs from that of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Also, we will consider the recently proposed $Om$ diagnostics to categorize the dark energy type of the model and obtain the $\omega$-varying alternative of the model that mimics the Hubble flow.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac test fields in the background of a black hole immersed in a galactic dark matter halo. The analytic black hole solution considered here is sourced by a physically motivated halo density profile that leads to a flat galactic rotation curve. Using the sixth-order WKB method with Padé approximants, we compute the QNM spectra for various field spins and parameter values, and provide numerical data in tabulated form. In addition to the numerical analysis, we derive analytic expressions for the quasinormal frequencies in the eikonal limit and beyond, by means of an expansion in inverse powers of the multipole number. We also calculate the Unruh temperature perceived by a static observer in the halo-modified spacetime. Our results demonstrate that the presence of the dark matter halo leads to observable modifications in the QNM spectra only if the density or compactness of the galactic halo is extraordinary high, so that quasinormal ringing a reliable observable for testing the black hole geometry, even in the presence of galactic environments.

 - **Abstract**
 When photons, gravitational waves, and massive particles such as neutrinos are gravitationally lensed the signals detected by telescopes or detectors on and around Earth are usually either magnified or demagnified. However, for stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes conventional methods for calculating the magnification factor usually only allow to calculate it relative to the spacetime position of the source but not with respect to the source's reference frame. While this may be sufficient when we want to investigate the properties of the lens, when we want to investigate the source and its properties we need to relate the detected signals to the same signals in the reference frame of their source. In this paper we will now show that for stationary and axisymmetric spacetimes which possess a Carter constant, we can use the constants of motion and the tetrad formalism to derive a magnification factor which relates a signal detected in the reference frame of an observer to the same signal in the reference frame of its source.

 - **Abstract**
 Black bounces are compact objects that combine the structures of regular black holes with those of wormholes. These spacetimes exhibit a rich causal structure and can differ fundamentally from usual black holes. In this work, we study the behavior of the tidal forces by considering different black bounce models. To this end, we start with the geodesic deviation equation and the tidal tensor, from which we compute the radial and angular components of the tidal forces. We find that these components are finite throughout the entire spacetime, including at the wormhole throats. Through the components of the displacement vector, we observe that, unlike the Schwarzschild case, a compression effect on bodies may occur in certain regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The stability of thin shell wormholes and black holes to linearized spherically symmetric perturbations about a static equilibrium is analyzed. Thin shell formalism is explored and junctions formed from combinations of Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild - de Sitter, and Schwarzschild - anti-de Sitter, as well as Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes are considered. The regions of stability for these different combinations are thoroughly described and plotted as a function of mass ratios of the Schwarzschild masses and radii of the wormhole throats. A taxonomy of the qualitative features of the various configurations and parameter spaces is developed, illustrating the stability regions when present. The considered wormholes are all found to be unstable in the causal region.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the thermodynamics, topology, and geometry of black holes in Lorentz-violating gravity. Modifications in the theory by perturbative parameter lead to coupled changes in horizon structure and thermodynamic behaviour, allowing us to derive generalized universal relations and explore implications for the Weak Gravity Conjecture. The thermodynamic topology reveals distinct topological charges, with photon spheres identified as robust topological defects. Our analysis shows that the Ruppeiner curvature remains universally negative across thermodynamic ensembles, indicating dominant attractive interactions among microstructures. This ensemble-independent behaviour highlights a fundamental thermodynamic universality in Lorentz-violating settings. Together, these results provide a consistent and rich framework for understanding black hole microphysics and gravitational consistency in modified theories. We further study the motion of timelike test particles in these black hole spacetimes by analyzing the effective potential shaped by the Lorentz-violating couplings. The resulting dynamics reveal the existence of bound orbits and stable circular trajectories, with the location of the innermost stable circular orbit and turning points significantly influenced by the parameters $\ell_{1,2}$, and the cosmological constant. Numerical simulations of trajectories in the $x-y,\,x-z$, and 3D planes show precessing, bounded, and plunging orbits, depending on the particle's specific energy and angular momentum. These results highlight how Lorentz-violating effects alter the structure of geodesic motion and provide potential observational signatures in the dynamics of massive particles near black holes.

 Carrollian field theories are usually understood as limits of relativistic theories. In this note, we use Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles equipped with a principal connection to construct Carrollian sigma models intrinsically. The resulting theories are neither ``electric'' nor ``magnetic'' in the usual sense. As a physically suggestive example, we derive a Carrollian wave equation governing the dynamics of a scalar field on the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole.
#### Detection probability of light compact binary mergers in future observing runs of the current ground-based gravitational wave detector network

 - **Abstract**
 With no binary neutron star (BNS) merger detected yet during the fourth observing run (O4) of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational wave (GW) detector network, despite the time-volume (VT) surveyed with respect to the end of O3 increased by more than a factor of three, a pressing question is how likely the detection of at least one BNS merger is in the remainder of the run. I present here a simple and general method to address such a question, which constitutes the basis for the predictions that have been presented in the LVK Public Alerts User Guide during the hiatus between the O4a and O4b parts of the run. The method, which can be applied to neutron star - black hole (NSBH) mergers as well, is based on simple Poisson statistics and on an estimate of the ratio of the VT span by the future run to that span by previous runs. An attractive advantage of this method is that its predictions are independent from the mass distribution of the merging compact binaries, which is very uncertain at the present moment. The results, not surprisingly, show that the most likely outcome of the final part of O4 is the absence of any BNS merger detection. Still, the probability of a non-zero number of detections is 34-46\%. For NSBH mergers, the probability of at least one additional detection is 64-71\%. The prospects for the next observing run O5 are more promising, with predicted numbers $N_\mathrm{BNS,O5}=28_{-21}^{+44}$, and the NSBH detections to be $N_\mathrm{NSBH,O5}=65_{-38}^{+61}$ (median and 90\% symmetric credible range), based on the current LVK detector target sensitivities for the run. The calculations presented here also lead to an update of the LVK local BNS merger rate density estimate that accounts for the absence of BNS merger detections in O4 so far, that reads $2.8\,\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}\leq R_0\leq 480\,\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The population of unresolved stellar-mass black hole binaries (sBBHs) is expected to produce a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) potentially detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). In this work, we compute the imprint of astrophysical environmental effect--such as gas dynamical friction and accretion--on this background. Using the sBBHs population constraints obtained by the LIGO--Virgo--Kagra collaboration, we compute the expected SGWB and develop a phenomenological parametric model that can accurately capture the effect of dynamical friction and accretion. Using our model, we perform Bayesian inference on simulated signals to assess the detectability of these environmental effects. We find that even for large injected values of the Eddington ratio, the effect of accretion in the SGWB is undetectable by LISA. However, LISA will be able to constrain the effect of dynamical friction with an upper bound on the gas density of $\rho \lesssim 7.6 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{g \, cm^{-3}}$, thus probing the sBBH environment forming in typical thin accretion disks around Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). For injected densities of $\rho \sim 10^{-10}-10^{-9} \mathrm{g} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, dynamical friction effects can be well measured and clearly distinguished from vacuum, with Bayes factors reaching up to $\sim$ 60, even when the Galactic foreground is included.

 - **Abstract**
 We numerically construct a family of stationary, axisymmetric black hole solutions in Einstein-Born-Infeld theory, incorporating both electric charge and rotation. Our results indicate that when nonlinear electromagnetic effects are weak, rotating BI black holes with fixed spin approach the extremal limit as the electric charge increases. In contrast, strong nonlinear effects lead to the termination of solutions at configurations corresponding to naked singularities. We demonstrate that nonlinear electrodynamics enhances the gyromagnetic ratio relative to that of Kerr-Newman (KN) black holes. Additionally, we analyze the Innermost Stable Circular Orbits (ISCOs) and find that both prograde and retrograde ISCO radii are consistently smaller than those found in KN black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Higher-derivative modifications of general relativity are generically expected from effective field theory approaches to quantum gravity, and they arise naturally in Lorentz-violating theories such as Einstein-Ether gravity. In this work, we investigate black hole spacetimes within Einstein-Ether theory supplemented by quadratic curvature corrections, including terms proportional to $R^2$, $R_{\mu\nu} R^{\mu\nu}$, and $R_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho} R^{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}$. We derive the corrected static, spherically symmetric metric perturbatively and examine its effects on the geodesic structure and gravitational wave emission. In particular, we analyze periodic timelike orbits in this background and compute the associated tensor-mode gravitational waveforms using the quadrupole approximation. Our results demonstrate that even small higher-derivative corrections can induce distinguishable shifts in the orbital dynamics and imprint characteristic phase modulations and harmonic deformations in the gravitational wave signal. These effects modify the frequency spectrum and amplitude envelope of $h_{+}$ and $h_{\times}$ in a manner sensitive to the coupling constants $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$, and the Ether parameter $c_{13}$. The resulting signatures provide a potential observational window into ultraviolet deviations from general relativity and Lorentz symmetry in the strong-field regime.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00936

 - **Abstract**
 The Deser-Woodard gravity is a modified theory of gravity in which nonlocality plays a central role. In this context, nonlocality is consequence of the inverse of the d'Alembertian operator $\square^{-1}$ in the effective action. Here, analytic black hole and wormhole solutions are built in the revised Deser-Woodard theory following a recent approach, where a special tetrad frame simplifies the complicated field equations of the theory. From deviations of the Schwarzschild metric and Reissner-Nordström metric, one obtains trasversable wormholes, singular black holes and a regular black hole as solutions of the vacuum field equations of the theory. Also, the auxiliary fields, which are responsible for the nonlocality, are computed. And even for a regular black solution, in which spacetime does not contain a curvature singularity, the corresponding auxiliary fields diverge at the event horizon.

 - **Abstract**
 A novel gauge-theoretic framework for spacetime and gravitation is proposed, in which a {\it Cartan khronon} field dynamically breaks the symmetry between space and time, enabling the emergence of temporality within a fundamentally Euclidean setting. Based on a $Spin(4)$ gauge structure, the theory provides a real-valued formulation of chiral spacetime, wherein the effects typically attributed to dark matter could instead be explained by the dynamics of gravitation. New results are presented with implications for a broad range of phenomena, including cosmology, large-scale structure, gravitational waves, black holes, and potential signatures accessible to laboratory experiments. By avoiding the pitfalls of complexification and reinterpreting chiral spacetime geometry through a real, dynamical, and gauge-theoretic lens, the {\it Cartan khronon} theory offers a fresh and compelling framework for revisiting the foundations of spacetime and gravitation.
