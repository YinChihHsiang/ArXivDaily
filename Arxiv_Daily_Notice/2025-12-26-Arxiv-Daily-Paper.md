#### Considering lensing effect on gravitational wave signals from black holes in mass gap

 - **Abstract**
 The pair-instability supernova (PISN) mechanism predicts a mass gap in the black hole population, where no stellar-origin black holes are expected to form. However, the binary black hole merger events GW190521 and GW231123 appear unusual, as current analyses place their component masses within the PISN mass gap. In this work, we investigate the relationship between different lensing magnifications and the inferred source-frame black hole masses for these two events. If the gravitational wave source is lensed, neglecting lensing effect can bias the inferred luminosity distance and hence the redshift, leading to an underestimation of the luminosity distance and consequently an overestimation of the source-frame masses, potentially placing them in the mass-gap region. For the two events in mass gap, when adopting a lower bound of $60 M_{\odot}$ for the mass gap, the minimum magnifications required to shift the inferred source-frame masses below this gap boundary are found to be $\mu=12.2$ for GW190521 and $\mu=320.1$ for GW231123, corresponding to lensing-corrected luminosity distances of $11155\, \mathrm{Mpc}$ and $15207\, \mathrm{Mpc}$, respectively. These results provide a quantitative reference for assessing the lensing hypothesis as a possible explanation for the existence of black holes in the PISN mass gap.

 - **Abstract**
 Mid-infrared (mid-IR) observations are crucial for understanding galaxy evolution, tracing star formation, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity via dust emission. This work presents mid-IR galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) at $0.5 < z < 6$, derived from the JWST Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) program. We combine 8 MIRI bands ($5-25$ $\mu$m) of SMILES and archival 23-band HST+JWST NIRCam photometry to construct an extensive catalog containing 2,813 galaxies with sub-$\mu$Jy level completeness in the mid-IR. We obtain monochromatic (in 5.6, 7.7, 10, 12.8, 15, 18, 21, and 25.5 $\mu$m), $L_{\rm IR}$, and AGN LFs, with a limiting luminosity down to $10^{9.5}$ $L_\odot$ at $z=0.5-1.0$, $\sim10^{10.5}$ $L_\odot$ at $z=2.0-4.0$, and to $\sim10^{11}$ $L_\odot$ at $z=4.0-6.0$. With the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of JWST, here we better constrain the faint-end slope and its evolution of the mid-IR LFs, quantifying the dusty cosmic star formation and black hole accretion histories out to $z \sim 5$. These results provide essential insights to refine our understanding of the obscured star formation and galaxy-AGN co-evolution over cosmic time.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20965

 - **Abstract**
 GW241011 and GW241110 both exhibit extremely asymmetric masses, high primary spins, and significant spin-orbit misalignment, which challenge the formation of first-generation binary black hole mergers formed from stellar collapse. This implies that these two gravitational wave events might originate from the hierarchical merger mechanism, with at least one of the black holes being the remnant of a previous merger. Here we investigate the origin of hierarchical mergers for GW241011 and GW241110 using the merger entropy index which measures the efficiency of entropy transfer for binary black hole mergers in general relativity. We find that GW241011 is consistent with hierarchical mergers in dense star clusters. The origin of GW241110 remains under debate due to its large distribution uncertainty, which leads to method-dependent inference and should be taken into account when interpreting this event in terms of hierarchical mergers.

#### Exploring the Role of Vector Potential and Plasma-$β$ in Jet Formation from Magnetized Accretion Flows

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21216

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate how the choice of initial vector potential and plasma parameters influences the development of accretion columns and jet formation in magnetized accretion flows. Using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we explore two different configurations of the vector potential $A_{\phi}$ and three plasma beta values $\beta$ = 50, 100, 500. We analyze how variations in the poloidal magnetic field strength and plasma magnetization affect magnetic flux accumulation near the black hole and the subsequent growth of the accretion column. Our results highlight the dependence of jet launching efficiency and accretion dynamics on the initial magnetic field topology and plasma beta, offering insight into the conditions that favor magnetically arrested disk or standard and normal evolution states.

#### Assessing systematic uncertainties from spectral re-analysis of Cyg X-1 with different coronal geometries

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we carry out a new spectral reanalysis of NuSTAR and Suzaku observations of the disk reflection spectra in the stellar-mass black hole X-ray binary Cyg~X-1. We compare three types of models: a broken power-law disk emissivity profile with no assumption about the coronal shape used in the previous work of the same observations, a compact lamppost corona, and an extended disk-like corona motivated by recent X-ray polarization results. Our goal is to measure the systematic uncertainties caused by the assumed geometry, with a focus on key parameters such as the black hole spin and the inclination of the inner accretion disk. We find that the disk-like corona gives a fit that is statistically similar to the broken power-law and lamppost models, but it leads to more physically reasonable results, such as a lower inclination angle of about $30^{\circ}$. By using a variable disk density model, we measure the disk density to be $n_{\rm e}\approx10^{20}$\,cm$^{-3}$, which is similar to earlier results. While the extended corona model infers a wider allowed parameter space for black hole spin and the inner radius of the disk-shaped coronal region, this reflects the additional physical freedom of the model. Even so, the disk-like corona remains a strong and physically well-motivated candidate for explaining the X-ray emission from Cyg~X-1.

#### Spinning extremal dyonic black holes in $γ=1$ Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20698

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a general framework for the study of asymptotically flat spinning dyonic {\it extremal} black holes (eBHs) in $D=4$ Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. Restricting to the stringy value $\gamma=1$ of the dilaton coupling constant, we report on the existence of a one parameter family of eBHs which are free of pathologies, provided their magnetic and electric charges are equal. An understanding of this condition is found from a study of the near horizon limit of the solutions, both perturbative closed form and numerical solutions being presented.

 - **Abstract**
 The coming decade will be crucial for determining the final design and configuration of a global network of next-generation (XG) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, including the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). In this study and for the first time, we assess the performance of various network configurations using neural posterior estimation (NPE) implemented in Dingo-IS-a method based on normalizing flows and importance sampling that enables fast and accurate inference. We focus on a specific science case involving short-duration, massive and high-redshift binary black hole (BBH) mergers with detector-frame chirp masses $M_{\mathrm{d}} > 100$ M$_\odot$. These systems encompass early-Universe stellar and primordial black holes, as well as intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, for which XG observatories are expected to deliver major discoveries. Validation against standard Bayesian inference demonstrates that NPE robustly reproduces complex and disconnected posterior structures across all network configurations. For a network of two misaligned L-shaped ET detectors (2L MisA), the posterior distributions on luminosity distance can become multimodal and degenerate with the sky position, leading to less precise distance estimates compared to the triangular ET configuration. However, the number of sky-location multimodalities is substantially lower than the eight expected with the triangular ET, resulting in improved sky and volume localization. Adding CE to the network further reduces sky-position degeneracies, and the better performance of the 2L MisA configuration over the triangle remains evident.

#### Visualization and analysis of the curvature invariants in the Alcubierre warp-drive spacetime

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20738

 - **Abstract**
 In the Alcubierre warp-drive spacetime, we investigate the following scalar curvature invariants: the scalar $I$, derived from a quadratic contraction of the Weyl tensor, the trace $R$ of the Ricci tensor, and the quadratic $r1$ and cubic $r2$ invariants from the trace-adjusted Ricci tensor. In four-dimensional spacetime the trace-adjusted Einstein and Ricci tensors are identical, and their unadjusted traces are oppositely signed yet equal in absolute value. This allows us to express these Ricci invariants using Einstein's curvature tensor, facilitating a direct interpretation of the energy-momentum tensor. We present detailed plots illustrating the distribution of these invariants. Our findings underscore the requirement for four distinct layers of an anisotropic stress-energy tensor to create the warp bubble. Additionally, we delve into the Kretschmann quadratic invariant decomposition. We provide a critical analysis of the work by Mattingly et al., particularly their underrepresentation of curvature invariants in their plots by 8 to 16 orders of magnitude. A comparison is made between the spacetime curvature of the Alcubierre warp-drive and that of a Schwarzschild black hole with a mass equivalent to the planet Saturn. The paper addresses potential misconceptions about the Alcubierre warp-drive due to inaccuracies in representing spacetime curvature changes and clarifies the classification of the Alcubierre spacetime, emphasizing its distinction from class $B$ warped product spacetimes.

#### Asymptotic dynamical analysis of $f(R,T^ϕ) = R+αT^ϕ + β(T^ϕ)^2/2$ cosmology

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20774

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we investigate the asymptotic cosmological dynamics of a modified gravity model based on the $f(R,T^\phi)$ theory, where $R$ denotes the Ricci scalar and $T^\phi$ is the trace of the stress-energy tensor of a scalar field. Despite the extensive study of $f(R,T)$ gravity, the asymptotic implications of quadratic trace couplings in scalar field cosmology remain largely unexplored. We focus on a specific form given by $ f(R,T^\phi) = R + \alpha T^\phi + \beta (T^\phi)^2/2$, in which the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ control the strength of non-minimal couplings between geometry and matter. We derive the set of cosmological equations for a spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic universe and construct the autonomous system of first-order differential equations using a compact set of dimensionless variables. This formulation provides a foundation for the qualitative analysis of the asymptotic behavior. We identify and classify all critical points and analyze their stability properties. Finally, the energy conditions and the presence of dynamical instabilities are examined. We study the general scenario $\alpha \neq 0$ and $\beta \neq 0$, along with the subcases $\alpha = 0$ and $\beta = 0$, in order to compare with minimally coupled quintessence $\alpha = \beta = 0$. We find that the quadratic term in $T^\phi$ admits late-time accelerated de Sitter-like critical solutions at the background level. However, several accelerated points lie in a degenerate scalar sector with $Q_s=0$, where the standard linear perturbation criteria are inconclusive, while the quasi-de Sitter point with $Q_s>0$ is of saddle type. Therefore, establishing full perturbative viability requires going beyond the linear analysis in the degenerate sector.

 - **Abstract**
 Circular photon orbits have become an attractive topic in recent years. They play extremely important roles in black hole shadows, gravitational lensings, quasi-normal modes, and spacetime topological properties. The development of analytical methods for these circular orbits has also drawn extensive attention. In our recent work, \href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. D \textbf{106}, L021501 (2022)}, a geometric approach to circular photon orbits was proposed for spherically symmetric spacetimes. In the present study, we give an extension of this geometric approach from spherically symmetric spacetimes to axially symmetric rotational spacetimes. In such a geometric approach, light rings in the equatorial plane are determined through the intrinsic curvatures in the optical geometry of Lorentz spacetime, which gives rise to a Randers-Finsler geometry for axially symmetric spacetimes. Specifically, light rings can be precisely determined by the condition of vanishing geodesic curvature, and the stability of light rings is classified through the intrinsic flag curvature in Randers-Finsler optical geometry. This geometric approach presented in this work is generally applicable to any stationary and axially symmetric spacetime, without imposing any restriction on the spacetime metric forms. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous demonstration to show that our geometric approach yields completely equivalent results with those derived from the conventional approach (based on the effective potential of photons).

#### Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole as a correlated qubit system via entropic identification

 - **Abstract**
 The thermodynamic behaviours of multi-horizon black holes such as a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole have been one of the long-standing mysteries in gravitational physics since they involve quantum natures in gravitational systems and that the search for quantum gravity has not reached its conclusion. In this work, we seeked for a possibility of realising the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole as a correlated qubit system, where each of the event horizon is treated as a qubit and both of them are correlated in a way that two qubits could be. By identifying the entropies of subsystems to those of qubits, we successfully constructed the reduced density matrices of the two subsystems as well as the density matrix for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, modelled as 2-correlating qubits. Moreover, our results suggested that when the gravitational effect has its role in the qubit systems, supposedly like black holes, the correlation between qubits are constrained with a lower bound more stringent than the so-called Araki-Lieb triangle inequality.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present a comprehensive semiclassical analysis of black hole radiation in a spatially flat FRW Universe for two fundamental nonclassical states: the Squeezed Number State (SNS) and the Coherent Squeezed Number State (CSNS). Unlike thermally modified earlier studies, SNS and CSNS constitute fully non-thermal, number-state-dependent quantum configurations. By embedding these states within the framework of semiclassical theory of gravity, we derive state-resolved expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy variation, and corresponding mass loss of an evaporating black hole. The influence of the squeezing parameter $\rho$ and number state parameter $n$ on Hawking emission is examined through a series of analytical results supported by twelve detailed plots. The analysis reveals that the Hawking temperature exhibits monotonic growth with increasing $\rho$ and $n$, thereby elevating the effective temperature experienced at the black hole horizon. The entropy variations $\Delta \mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{SNS}}$ and $\Delta \mathbb{S}_{\mathrm{CSNS}}$ show strong nonlinear enhancement, especially at moderate and large squeezing values. Overall, the study extends earlier thermal squeezed-state approaches to a fully number-state-resolved framework, highlighting the sensitivity of Hawking emission to nonclassical quantum configurations. These findings contribute a new perspective on gravitational particle creation in cosmological settings.

#### Linking interior curvature to observable shadows: A case study of nonsingular black holes

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21178

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21178

 - **Abstract**
 We establish a direct connection between the interior curvature structure of nonsingular black holes (BHs) with a Minkowski core and their observable optical signatures. By classifying these spacetimes into three fundamental types, Type I (Kretschmann scalar K_max increasing with mass M), Type II (mass-independent K_max), and Type III (K_max decreasing with M), we demonstrate how subtle variations in the core geometry imprint distinguishable features on the BH shadow. A detailed analysis of photon dynamics reveals that the parameters {\alpha} and n, which control the deviation from Schwarzschild geometry and the radial decay of the regularizing factor, respectively, systematically alter the properties of the photon sphere. These intrinsic geometric differences propagate outward: for fixed parameters, Type III BHs, with the most compact photon sphere, produce the smallest and brightest shadows, whereas Type I BHs yield the largest and dimmest ones. Shadow computations under both static and infalling spherical accretion models confirm that the curvature-based classification directly corresponds to observable differences. Critically, Type III BHs exhibit the strongest sensitivity to parameter variations, making them optimal probes for constraining the underlying spacetime geometry. Our work reveals that even among nonsingular BHs sharing the same asymptotic core, differences in internal curvature are reflected in the shadow morphology, thereby providing a new pathway to test quantum-gravity-inspired models using upcoming high-resolution observations.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21274

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that in constructing asymptotically flat vacuum initial data sets in General Relativity via the conformal method, certain asymptotic structures may be prescribed a priori through the specified seed data, including the ADM momentum components, the leading- and next-to-leading-order decay rates, and the anisotropy in the metric's mass term, yielding a recipe to construct initial data sets with desired asymptotics. We numerically construct a simple explicit example of an initial data set, with stronger asymptotics than have been obtained in previous work, such that the evolution of this initial data set does not exhibit the conjectured antipodal symmetry between future and past null infinity.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves provide a unique window into gravity, cosmology, and high-energy physics, enabling the exploration of fundamental phenomena across a wide range of scales. This review presents a coherent and pedagogical framework that bridges foundational theory with observational frontiers. We begin by developing the theory of gravitational radiation within linearized general relativity, deriving gravitational waves as solutions to the linearized Einstein equations and clarifying their physical interpretation, polarization states, and key properties. We then deepen the discussion through a geometric perspective, tracing the connection between gravitational radiation and the algebraic structure of the Weyl tensor and its role in defining energy and angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Extending beyond flat backgrounds, we examine gravitational waves in an expanding universe, following their evolution across cosmological epochs and their generation during inflation. Within this setting, we discuss adiabatic modes and consistency relations that reveal universal properties of long-wavelength perturbations, and derive the inflationary spectrum of vacuum gravitational waves together with their contribution to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We also survey the main observational strategies for detecting gravitational waves across a broad frequency range, including cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing arrays, ground- and space-based laser interferometers, and resonant cavity detectors. We then discuss the astrophysical and cosmological mechanisms responsible for generating gravitational radiation. We conclude by summarizing the current status of the field and outlining promising directions for future theoretical and observational developments.

#### Probing Stringy Horizons with Pole-Skipping in Non-Maximal Chaotic Systems

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20700

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study pole-skipping in non-maximally quantum chaotic systems. Using Rindler conformal field theories and the large-$q$ SYK chain as illustrative examples, we argue that the pole-skipping points of few-body operators organize into trajectories in the complex frequency-momentum plane, with the leading trajectory encoding the quantum Lyapunov exponent. We further propose that these trajectories admit a natural interpretation as Regge trajectories of stringy excitations in a dual stringy black hole geometry. From this perspective, pole-skipping for an individual operator can be viewed as tracking the stringy horizon through the response of a single excitation. Our results suggest that pole-skipping reflects intrinsic properties of quantum chaotic systems and may be deeply connected to the structure of horizons in the stringy regime.

 - **Abstract**
 It was recently shown that black holes decohere any quantum superpositions in their vicinity. This decoherence is mediated by soft radiation through the horizon, and can be understood as the result of the fact that quantum states in the exterior source distinguishable states of long-range fields in the interior. To study this phenomenon and others, we extend Tomita-Takesaki theory to accommodate states of soft radiation such as arise in the electromagnetic and gravitational memory effects, and provide a general framework for computing the distinguishability of general coherent states. Applying these tools, we use the methods of unambiguous state discrimination and approximate quantum error correction to prove some new relations regarding the distinguishability of quantum states, and the quantum information content of soft radiation, and thereby show that a black hole (or any horizon) decoheres its environment as though its interior were full of optimal observers.

 - **Abstract**
 Dilatonic black hole dyon-like solutions in the gravitational $4d$ model with a scalar field, two 2-forms, two dilatonic coupling constants $\lambda_i \neq 0$, $i =1,2$, obeying $\lambda_1 \neq - \lambda_2$ and the sign parameter $\varepsilon = \pm 1$ for scalar field kinetic term are overviewed. Here $\varepsilon = - 1$ corresponds to a phantom scalar field. The solutions are defined up to solutions of two master equations for two moduli functions, when $\lambda^2_i \neq 1/2$ for $\varepsilon = - 1$. Several integrable cases corresponding to Lie algebras $A_1 + A_1$, $A_2$, $B_2 = C_2$ and $G_2$ are considered. Some physical parameters of the solutions are derived: gravitational mass, scalar charge, Hawking temperature, black hole area entropy and PPN parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$. Bounds on the gravitational mass and scalar charge (based on a certain conjecture) are presented.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a topological classification of the phase structure of a four-dimensional AdS black hole with non-minimal Maxwell coupling. Critical points are treated as topological defects, allowing us to assign a winding number to each black hole branch and compute the global topological invariant W. The system exhibits a duality governed by its Maxwell charge Q: for large Q it falls into the class W = 1, displaying van der Waals-type behavior with a first-order small-large black hole transition. For small Q, it shifts to W = 0, characteristic of a Hawking-Page transition. This topological classification provides a model-independent validation of the conventional thermodynamic analysis. Crucially, we find that the non-minimal coupling lambda stabilizes the Hawking-Page universality class W=0 for black holes with non-zero charge, a phenomenon absent in the standard Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS case. This establishes a direct link between the microscopic coupling and the macroscopic topological class, demonstrating the power of topological methods in decoding thermodynamic universality across modified gravity theories.

 - **Abstract**
 We study multipartite entanglement in typical pure states holographically dual to pure BTZ black holes, using multi-entropy and its ``genuine'' version. In the bulk, these quantities are computed by minimal geodesic networks (so-called Steiner trees). We find that at sufficiently high temperature, the genuine tripartite multi-entropy exhibits a volume-law scaling in sharp contrast to vacuum AdS$_3$, where the genuine contribution is universal and size-independent. Moreover, we find another phase: once one subsystem exceeds half of the total system, the leading genuine tripartite entanglement vanishes and reduces to that for global AdS${}_3$. This transition is indeed consistent with recent arguments for distillable EPR pairs in tripartite Haar-random states. Motivated by finite-cutoff holography, we further study the radial cutoff dependence of multi-entropy and show that genuine multi-entropy acquires nontrivial size dependence even for the tripartite case in AdS${}_3$. As a byproduct, we also observe an intriguing ``area-law'' contribution to multi-entropy that is relevant to vacuum AdS${}_3$.

 - **Abstract**
 We study deformations of the model by Henneaux, Martínez, Troncoso and Zanelli [arXiv:hep-th/0201170] which features asymptotically AdS$_3$ black hole solutions that incorporate the exact backreaction of a scalar field. The presence of bulk matter causes the $T \overline T$ deformation of the (putative) dual CFT$_2$ to differ from the deformation defined in the bulk by imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions at finite radius. We work out both of these deformations explicitly and verify that $T \overline T$-deforming the boundary theory corresponds to imposing mixed boundary conditions on the metric at the conformal boundary, whereas the bulk "Dirichlet deformation" gives rise to a field theory deforming operator that includes $T \overline T$ as well as other irrelevant terms. We check our results by calculating the deformed energy spectrum for either case using both the bulk and boundary prescriptions, finding agreement after taking into account additional terms coming from the flow of the scalar source. We interpret our explicit results and compare them with the predictions of similar proposals in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the holographic construction of timelike entanglement entropy (tEE) in black hole backgrounds in Lorentzian geometries. The holographic tEE is realized through extremal surfaces consisting of spacelike and timelike branches that encode its real and imaginary components, respectively. In the BTZ black hole, these surfaces extend into the interior of the black hole and reproduce the field-theoretic results. The analysis is further generalized to higher-dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black holes, where the characteristics of tEE are obtained with increasing size of the boundary subsystem. Besides, we also show that the boundary subsystem length diverges at a dimension-dependent critical turning point. Notably, this critical point moves closer to the black hole horizon as the dimensionality of the bulk increases. For large subsystem lengths, the finite part of the tEE displays a characteristic volume-plus-area structure, with a real volume term and a complex coefficient of the area term approaching constant values at large dimensions. Besides, we also study the monotonicity of a new quantity, timelike entanglement density, which offers insights into a timelike area theorem in specific limits. Subsequently, we investigate the near-horizon dynamics in various black hole backgrounds, where the spacelike and timelike surfaces exhibit exponential growth of the form $e^{\frac{2\pi}{\beta} \Delta t}$ with inverse black hole temperature $\beta$.
