#### Synergies between Euclid, Roman and JWST Could Reveal Quasars at up to $z \sim$ 15

 - **Abstract**
 Although supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found at the centers of most galaxies today, over 300 have now been discovered at $z >$ 6, including a $4 \times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ BH in UHZ1 at $z = 10.1$ and an $8\times10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ BH in GHZ9 at $z =$ 10.4. They are thought to form when 10$^4$ - 10$^5$ M$_{\odot}$ primordial stars die as direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) at $z \sim$ 20 - 25. While studies have shown that DCBHs should be visible at birth at $z \gtrsim$ 20 in the near infrared (NIR) to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), none have considered SMBH detections at later stages growth down to $z \sim$ 6 - 7. Here, we present continuum NIR luminosities for a quasar like ULAS J1120+0641, a $1.35 \times 10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ BH at $z =$ 7.1, from a cosmological simulation for Euclid, Roman Space Telescope (RST) and JWST bands from $z =$ 6 - 15. We find that Euclid and RST could detect such BHs, including others like UHZ1 and GHZ9, at much earlier stages of evolution, out to $z \sim$ 14 - 15, and that their redshifts could be confirmed spectroscopically with JWST. Synergies between these three telescopes could thus reveal the numbers of quasars at much higher redshifts and discriminate between their formation channels because Euclid and RST can capture large numbers of them in wide-field surveys for further study by JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift observations from JWST indicate that optical strong line ratios do not carry the same constraining power as they do at low redshifts. Critically, this prevents a separation between stellar- and black hole-driven ionizing radiation, thereby obscuring both active galactic nuclei demographics and star formation rates. To investigate this, we compute a large suite of photoionization models from Cloudy powered by stellar populations and accreting black holes over a large grid of ages, metallicities, initial mass functions, binarity, ionization parameters, densities, and black hole masses. We use these models to test three rest-frame optical strong line ratio diagnostics which have been designed to separate ionizing sources at low redshifts: the [NII]-BPT, VO87, and OHNO diagrams. We show that the position of a model in these diagrams is strongly driven by the ionization parameter (log U) and the gas-phase metallicity, often more so than the ionizing spectrum itself; in particular, there is significant overlap between stellar population and accreting black hole models at high log U and low Z. We show that the OHNO diagram is especially susceptible to large contamination of the AGN region defined at z=1 for stellar models with high log U and low Z, consistent with many observed JWST spectra at high redshift. We show that the optical line ratio diagnostics are most sensitive to the shape of the <54 eV ionizing continuum, and that the derived ionizing sources for a given set of optical strong line ratios can be highly degenerate. Finally, we demonstrate that very high ionization (>54 eV) emission lines that trace ionizing sources harder than normal stellar populations help to break the degeneracies present when using the strong line diagnostics alone, even in gas conditions consistent with those at high redshifts.

 - **Abstract**
 We present Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing measurements obtained by cross-correlating spectroscopically observed galaxies from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) with source galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Survey, the Kilo-Degree Survey, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and the Dark Energy Survey. Specifically, we measure the excess surface mass density $\Delta\Sigma$ and tangential shear $\gamma_\mathrm{t}$ for the Bright Galaxy Sample and Luminous Red Galaxies measured within the first year of observations with DESI. To ensure robustness, we test the measurements for systematic biases, finding no significant trends related to the properties of the \acrshort{desi} lens galaxies. We identify a significant trend with the average redshift of source galaxies, however, this trend vanishes once we apply shifts to the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Survey redshift distributions that are also favored by their fiducial cosmology analysis. Additionally, we compare the observed scatter in the measurements with the theoretical covariance and find excess scatter, driven primarily by small-scale measurements of $r\leq 1 \, \mathrm{Mpc}/h$; measurements on larger scales are consistent at the $2\,\sigma$ level. We further present the projected clustering measurements $w_p$ of the galaxy samples in the the first data release of DESI. These measurements, which will be made publicly available, serve as a foundation for forthcoming cosmological analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 The large-scale environments of active galactic nuclei (AGN) reveal important information on the growth and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Previous AGN clustering measurements using 2-point correlation functions have hinted that AGN with massive black holes preferentially reside in denser cosmic regions than AGN with less-massive SMBHs. At the same time, little to no dependence on the accretion rate is found. However, the significance of such trends have been limited. Here we present kth-nearest-neighbor (kNN) statistics of 2MASS galaxies around AGN from the Swift/BAT AGN Spectroscopic survey. These statistics have been shown to contribute additional higher-order clustering information on the cosmic density field. By calculating the distances to the nearest 7 galaxy neighbors in angular separation to each AGN within two redshift ranges(0.01 < z < 0.03 and 0.03 < z < 0.06), we compare their cumulative distribution functions to that of a randomly distributed sample to show the sensitivity of this method to the clustering of AGN. We also split the AGN into bins of bolometric luminosity, black hole mass, and Eddington ratio (while controlling for redshift) to search for trends between kNN statistics and fundamental AGN properties. We find that AGN with massive SMBHs have significantly closer neighbors than AGN with less-massive SMBHs (at the 99.98% confidence level), especially in our lower redshift range. We find less significant trends with luminosity or Eddington ratio. By comparing our results to empirical SMBH-galaxy-halo models implemented in N-body simulations, we show that small-scale kNN trends with black hole mass may go beyond stellar mass dependencies. This suggests that massive SMBHs in the local universe reside in more massive dark matter halos and denser regions of the cosmic web, which may indicate that environment is important for the growth of SMBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 The process of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) fuelling relies on the transport of gas across several orders of magnitude in physical scale until the gas reaches the supermassive black hole at the centre of a galaxy. This work explores the role of kinematically misaligned gas in the fuelling of AGN in a sample of 4769 local galaxies from the MaNGA survey. We investigate for the first time the relative role of external interactions and the presence of kinematic misalignment as mechanisms to explain the observed increase in AGN fraction in galaxies with large stellar to gas kinematic misalignment ($>$45 degrees). Using a sample of galaxies with evidence of recent external interactions we find that there is a significantly higher fraction of AGN in those where a large stellar to gas kinematic misalignment is observed (20$^{+6}_{-4}\%$) compared with 6.2$^{+0.6}_{-0.5}\%$ in galaxies where no kinematic misalignment is observed. We determine that gas to stellar misalignment has an important role in the fraction of AGN observed, increasing the AGN fraction beyond the potential effect of external interactions. This result demonstrates the importance of misaligned structures to the fuelling of supermassive black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present morphological classifications for the hosts of 1189 hard X-ray selected (14-195 keV) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Swift-BAT 105-month catalog as part of the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS). BASS provides a powerful all-sky census of nearby AGN, minimizing obscuration biases and providing a robust dataset for studying AGN-host galaxy connections. Classifications are based on volunteer-based visual inspection on the Zooniverse platform, adapted from Galaxy Zoo DECaLS (GZD). Dual-contrast grz color composite images, generated from public surveys (e.g., NOAO Legacy Survey, Pan-STARRS, SDSS) and dedicated observations enabled key morphological features to be identified. Our analysis reveals that, with respect to a control sample of inactive galaxies matched in redshift and i-band magnitude, BASS AGN hosts show a deficiency of smooth ellipticals (~70%) and disks with prominent arms (~80%), while displaying an excess of mergers or disturbed systems (~400%), and disk galaxies without a spiral structure (~300%). These trends suggest a preference for AGN activity in gas-rich, dynamically disturbed environments or transitional disk systems. We also find a higher bar fraction among AGN hosts than the control sample (~50% vs. ~30%). We further explore the relations between AGN properties (e.g., X-ray luminosity, black hole mass, and Eddington ratio) and host morphology, and find that high-luminosity and high-accretion AGN preferentially reside in smooth or point-like hosts. In parallel, lower-luminosity AGN are more common in disk galaxies. These results underscore the importance of morphological studies in understanding the fueling and feedback mechanisms that drive AGN activity and their role in galaxy evolution. Our dataset provides a valuable benchmark for future multiwavelength surveys (e.g. LSST, Roman, and Euclid) and automated morphological classification efforts.
#### Spectroscopic Analysis of Pictor II: a very low metallicity ultra-faint dwarf galaxy bound to the Large Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 We present Magellan/IMACS and Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy of the ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy Pictor~II (Pic~II) that is located only 12 kpc from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). From the IMACS spectroscopy, we identify 13 member stars and measure a mean heliocentric velocity of $326.9\pm1.1~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, a velocity dispersion of $3.5_{-0.9}^{+1.1}~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, a mean metallicity of $\overline{\rm [Fe/H]}=-2.99\pm0.06$, and an upper limit on the metallicity dispersion of $\sigma_{\rm [Fe/H]}<0.18$. We measure detailed elemental abundances for the brightest star, finding $\mbox{[Fe/H]} = -3.3$, high [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios, and no detectable neutron capture elements, similar to stars in other UFDs. However, this star has an unusually high [Sc/Fe] ratio. The dynamical mass-to-light ratio ($M/L=760_{-420}^{+910}~M_{\odot}~L^{-1}_{\odot}$), size, and chemical abundances confirms that Pic~II is a dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxy. We perform detailed orbit modeling of Pic~II in a combined Milky Way (MW) and LMC potential and find that Pic~II is highly likely to be a long-term LMC satellite. Furthermore, we find that Pic II is likely still bound to the LMC today. Pic~II is the seventh LMC-associated UFD and among the most metal-poor UFDs known. We further update the morphological parameters with deeper Dark Energy Camera (DECam) photometry, compute the dark matter properties for dark matter indirect detection searches, verify the extremely low metallicity with narrowband CaHK imaging, and briefly discuss tidal influences of the LMC and MW.

 - **Abstract**
 Although the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration detects many individually resolvable gravitational-wave events from binary black hole mergers, those that are too weak to be identified individually contribute to a stochastic gravitational-wave background. Unlike the standard cross-correlation search for excess correlated power, a Bayesian search method that models the background as a superposition of an unknown number of mergers enables simultaneous inference of the properties of high-redshift binary black hole populations and accelerated detection of the background. In this work, we apply this templated background search method to one day of simulated data at current LIGO Hanford-Livingston detector network sensitivity to determine whether the weakest mergers contribute information to the detection of the background and to the constraint on the merger redshift distribution at high redshifts. We find that the dominant source of information for the detection of the stochastic background comes from mergers with signal-to-noise ratios just below the individual detection threshold. However, we demonstrate that the weakest mergers do contribute to the constraint on the shape of the redshift distribution not only beyond the peak of star formation, but also beyond the redshifts accessible with individually detectable sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The precession phenomenon of the jet in a gamma-ray burst (GRB) is a key probe of the physics of the central engine. Previous studies generally assumed a fixed precession period when analysing the temporal profiles in GRBs; however, the dynamic evolution of the fallback process and accretion disk can significantly affect the precession behaviour. In this work we present a jet precession model that incorporates the co-evolution of fallback accretion and the central black hole (BH). Our model demonstrates that the jet precession period initially decreases rapidly during the early fallback phase and subsequently increases nearly linearly as the disk evolves. We find that a higher accretion disk viscosity and a slower BH spin lead to longer precession periods and faster precession period growth rates, and that the geometric structure of the precession system modulates the pulse amplitude of the light curve. By fitting the model to observational data of GRBs with multi-pulse structures, we show that jet precession can naturally explain the increasing pulse intervals and broadened pulse widths observed in both long and short GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed a large population of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the distant universe, which are challenging our understanding of early massive black hole seeding and growth. We expand the exploration of this population to lower luminosities by stacking $\sim 600$ NIRSpec grating spectra from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) at $3<z<7$, in bins of redshift, [OIII]5007 luminosity and equivalent width, UV luminosity and stellar mass. In various stacks, we detect a broad component of H$\alpha$ without a counterpart in [OIII], implying that it is not due to outflows but is tracing the Broad Line Region (BLR) of a large population of low-luminosity AGN not detected in individual spectra. We also consider the possible contribution from Supernovae (SNe) and Very Massive Stars and conclude that while this is very unlikely, we cannot exclude some potential contribution by SNe to some of the stacks. The detection, in some stacks, of high [OIII]4363/H$\gamma$, typical of AGN, further confirms that such stacks reveal a large population of AGN. We infer that the stacks probe black holes with masses of a few times $10^6~M_\odot$ accreting at rates $L/L_{Edd}\sim 0.02-0.1$, i.e. a low mass and dormant parameter space poorly explored by previous studies on individual targets. We identify populations of black holes that fall within the scatter of the local $M_{BH}-M_{*}$ scaling relation, indicating that there is a population of high-z BHs that are not overmassive relative to their host galaxies and which have been mostly missed in previous JWST observations. Yet, on average, the stacks are still overmassive relative the local relation, with some of them 1-2 dex above it. We infer that the BH mass function (BHMF) at $3<z<5$ rises steeply at low masses. The BHMF is consistent with models in which BHs evolve through short bursts of super-Eddington accretion.
#### A pipeline to search for signatures of line-of-sight acceleration in gravitational wave signals produced by compact binary coalescences

 - **Abstract**
 Compact binary coalescences (CBCs), such as merging binary black holes (BBHs), binary neutron stars (BNSs), or neutron star black holes (NSBHs), hosted by dense stellar environments, could produce gravitational waves (GWs) that contain signatures of line-of-sight acceleration (LOSA) imparted by the environment's gravitational potential. We calculate the Post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the $(2,\,2)$ mode GW phase due to a finite LOSA, starting from the leading order at -4 PN below the quadrupole order, up to 3.5 PN above the quadrupole order. We do so for binaries whose component spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum, as well as for binaries with non-zero tidal deformation. We implement these corrections into the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration's flagship parameter estimation (PE) software \textsc{Bilby\_tgr}. We study the systematics associated with recovering LOSAs. We find that, when the injection and recovery waveform models are identical, LOSAs are recovered as expected. We test the robustness of the pipeline against waveforms with strong higher-mode signatures or signatures of beyond-general-relativistic (beyond-GR) effects, to delimit the range of applicability of our GR-consistent quasi-circular LOSA-corrected waveforms.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a framework to study the relation between the stellar mass of a galaxy and the total mass of its host dark matter halo using galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements. We model a wide range of scales, roughly from $\sim 100 \; {\rm kpc}$ to $\sim 100 \; {\rm Mpc}$, using a theoretical framework based on the Halo Occupation Distribution and data from Year 3 of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) dataset. The new advances of this work include: 1) the generation and validation of a new stellar mass-selected galaxy sample in the range of $\log M_\star/M_\odot \sim 9.6$ to $\sim 11.5$; 2) the joint-modeling framework of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing that is able to describe our stellar mass-selected sample deep into the 1-halo regime; and 3) stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) constraints from this dataset. In general, our SHMR constraints agree well with existing literature with various weak lensing measurements. We constrain the free parameters in the SHMR functional form $\log M_\star (M_h) = \log(\epsilon M_1) + f\left[ \log\left( M_h / M_1 \right) \right] - f(0)$, with $f(x) \equiv -\log(10^{\alpha x}+1) + \delta [\log(1+\exp(x))]^\gamma / [1+\exp(10^{-x})]$, to be $\log M_1 = 11.559^{+0.334}_{-0.415}$, $\log \epsilon = -1.689^{+0.333}_{-0.220}$, $\alpha = -1.637^{+0.107}_{-0.096}$, $\gamma = 0.588^{+0.265}_{-0.220}$ and $\delta = 4.227^{+2.223}_{-1.776}$. The inferred average satellite fraction is within $\sim 5-35\%$ for our fiducial results and we do not see any clear trends with redshift or stellar mass. Furthermore, we find that the inferred average galaxy bias values follow the generally expected trends with stellar mass and redshift. Our study is the first SHMR in DES in this mass range, and we expect the stellar mass sample to be of general interest for other science cases.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present a kinematic analysis of the Universe's expansion history using cosmography, with a particular emphasis on the jerk parameter $j_0$, which is equal to one in the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario. We use distance measurements from DESI DR2, both independently and in combination with current Type Ia supernova (SN) samples, to constrain the cosmographic parameters up to the fourth order without relying on a specific cosmological model. Our results show that for the DESI DR2 data alone, the $\Lambda$CDM prediction ($j_0 = 1$) falls within the 2$\sigma$ confidence region. However, when DESI DR2 is combined with the Union3, Pantheon+, and DESY5 SN datasets, the result obtained is discrepant with the $\Lambda$CDM model at about 3.4$\sigma$, 4.1$\sigma$, and 5.4$\sigma$, respectively. These results are consistent with the conclusions based on dark energy parameterizations reported by the DESI Collaboration, which suggest the presence of a dynamic dark energy component in the universe.

 We present a measurement of the amplitude of matter fluctuations over the redshift range 0.8 <= z <= 3.5 from the cross correlation of over 1.2 million spectroscopic quasars selected by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) across 7,200 deg$^2$ (approx 170 quasars/deg$^2$) and Planck PR4 (NPIPE) cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing maps. We perform a tomographic measurement in three bins centered at effective redshifts z=1.44, 2.27 and 2.75, which have ample overlap with the CMB lensing kernel. From a joint fit using the angular clustering of all three redshift bins (auto and cross-spectra), and including an $\Omega_m$ prior from DESI DR1 baryon acoustic oscillations to break the $\Omega_m-\sigma_8$ degeneracy, we constrain the amplitude of matter fluctuations in the matter-dominated regime to be $\sigma_8=0.929^{+0.059}_{-0.074}$ and $S_8\equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.922^{+0.059}_{-0.073}$. We provide a growth of structure measurement with the largest spectroscopic quasar sample to date at high redshift, which is 1.5$\sigma$ higher than predictions from $\Lambda$CDM fits to measurements of the primary CMB from Planck PR4. The cross-correlation between PR4 lensing maps and DESI DR1 quasars is detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of 21.7 and the quasar auto-correlation at 27.2 for the joint analysis of all redshift bins. We combine our measurement with the CMB lensing auto-spectrum from the ground-based Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT DR6) and Planck PR4 to perform a sound-horizon-free measurement of the Hubble constant, yielding $H_0=69.1^{+2.2}_{-2.6}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ through its sensitivity to the matter-radiation equality scale.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we demonstrate that the geometry of a spherically symmetric black hole surrounded by a Kiselev anisotropic fluid can be effectively mimicked by an experimental setup as the ones used to investigate some physical phenomena associated with acoustic black holes. Thus, we construct the metric describing Kiselev acoustic black holes by using the Gross--Pitaevskii theory and present a general analytical solution that encompasses, as particular cases, several classes of geometries associated with black holes. This unified framework allows for the description of a wide variety of analogue spacetimes, including new analogue geometries that have not been previously explored in the literature. Then, we examine the behavior of scalar field perturbations in this background by solving the massless Klein--Gordon equation. Depending on the boundary conditions between the acoustic event horizon and infinity, we obtain the quasinormal and quasibound spectra. This study opens up avenues for experimental investigation within the context of analog gravity models, by offering new possibilities to simulate and study black hole phenomena in laboratory settings.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the dynamical excitation of quasinormal modes (QNMs) through the plunge, merger and ringdown of an extreme-mass-ratio-inspiral into a Schwarzschild black hole, for generic orbital configurations. We work out the QNM causality condition, crucial to eliminate amplitude divergences and to incorporate horizon redshift effects. We then use it to derive a model of the time-dependent QNM excitation via a Green's function approach, driven by the point-particle source on a given trajectory. Our model predicts that: i) QNMs propagates along hyperboloidal slices in the minimal gauge; ii) the signal is composed of an ``activation'' term, depending on the source past history, and a local ``impulsive'' term; iii) amplitudes grow in time in an ``activation function'' fashion, and the waveform displays a stationary ringdown regime at times $\sim 10-20M$ after its peak; iv) at these late times, an infinite tower of non-oscillatory, exponentially-damped terms appear: the redshift modes. The model is in good agreement with numerical solutions, capturing the main waveform features after the peak. Additional components of the Green's function are required to complement the QNM description and reproduce the plunge-merger waveform. We predict the late-time, stationary amplitude of the quadrupolar mode as a function of eccentricity, in agreement with accurate numerical solutions, marking the first time that QNM amplitudes are predicted for generic binary configurations. Our work provides a first solid step towards analytically modeling the inspiral's imprint onto ringdown signals, generalizable to include higher orders in the mass ratio, black hole spin, non-vacuum configurations and corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the black hole information paradox in the setting of pseudo-complex gravity, a covariant geometric extension of general relativity that introduces a minimal length scale by deforming the spacetime manifold. In this framework, curvature invariants stay finite, and the classical singularity is geometrically regularized via a smooth core. We show that the correction term B/(6r**4) alters the Schwarzschild metric, generating the regularized geometry above, yielding a finite Hawking temperature, and inducing subleading corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Crucially, we demonstrate that the pseudo-complex geometric structure obstructs a clean factorization of the Hilbert space into interior and exterior regions, thereby removing the key assumption behind the standard derivation of the paradox. This structural reinterpretation of entanglement flow offers a new geometric route to unitarity preservation and information recovery. We examine the resulting effects on evaporation dynamics, entropy flow, and thermodynamic behavior. Our predictions are compared with those of generalized uncertainty principles (GUP), loop quantum gravity (LQG), and island-based models, and are summarized in a comparative table. Observable signatures-such as shifts in quasi-normal mode frequencies and the appearance of gravitational wave echoes from the regularized core-suggest that pseudo-complex gravity is a testable, covariant approach to resolving the paradox without invoking firewalls, holography, or exotic quantum states.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study the upper and lower bounds on the minimum orbital period of 5-dimensional charged black holes. Our results indicate that the upper bound of the minimum orbital period corresponds to non-charged black holes, while the lower bound is achieved in the case of maximally charged black holes. We further establish precise analytical expressions for the upper and lower bounds of the minimum orbital period. Our findings provide valuable insights into 5-dimensional charged black holes and help constrain theoretical gravity models.

 - **Abstract**
 With an intent to explore the interplay between the Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) and the presence of dark matter (DM), we obtain a static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solution in the background of nonminimally coupled Kalb-Ramond (KR) field surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM). The KR field is frozen to a non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) that breaks the particle Lorentz symmetry spontaneously. We explore scalar invariants, Ricci Scalar, Ricci squared, and Kretschmann Scalar, to probe the nature of singularities in the obtained solution. We then study strong gravitational lensing in the background of our BH, i.e., KRPFDM BH, revealing the adverse impact of LSB parameter $\alpha$ and PFDM parameter $\beta$ on the lensing coefficients. The significant effect of our model parameters is evident in strong lensing observables. Bounds on the deviation from Schwarzschild, $\delta$, for supermassive BHs (SMBHs) $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ from the EHT, Keck, and VLTI observatories are then utilized to put our BH model to the test and extract possible values of model parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ that generate theoretical predictions in line with experimental observations within $1\sigma$ confidence level. Our study sheds light on the combined effect of LSB and PFDM and may be helpful in finding their signature.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurement of deviations in the Kerr metric using gravitational wave (GW) observations will provide a clear signal of new Physics. Previous studies have developed multiple parameterizations (e.g. ``bumpy" spacetime) to characterize such deviations in extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRI) and employed analyses based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) formalism to quantify the constraining power of space-borne GW detectors like LISA and Tianqin, e.g., achieving a constraint sensitivity levels of $10^{-4} \sim 10^{-2}$ on the dimensionless bumpy parameter $\delta \tilde{Q}$ under varying source configurations in analytical kluge waveform for LISA. In this paper, we advance prior analyses by integrating particle swarm optimization (PSO) with matched filtering under a restricted parameter search range to enforce a high probability of convergence for PSO. Our results reveal a significant number of degenerate peaks in the likelihood function over the signal parameter space with values that exceed the injected one. This extreme level of degeneracy arises from the involvement of the additional bumpy parameter $\delta \tilde{Q}$ in the parameter space and introduces systematic errors in parameter estimation. We show that these systematic errors can be mitigated using information contained in the ensemble of degenerate peaks, thereby restoring the reliability of astrophysical inferences about EMRI systems from GW observations. This study highlights the critical importance of accounting for such degeneracies, which are absent in FIM-based analyses, and points out future directions for improving EMRI data analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 A state of the art of the different deformations of space-time measured for more than a hundred years in the case of general relativity in the weak field is carried out. The phenomena of general relativity in low fields targeted are gravitational waves, Lense-thirring effects, gravitational lensing, gravitation around the earth or the sun. The overview of these different deformations highlights the different active components of the perturbation tensor of the metric $h_{\mu\nu}$. The authors show that each phenomenon corresponds to one or more very specific components of this tensor. They also show that the various components of the latter have as an image, within the framework of the elastic analogy of space-time, various coherent components of an associated strain tensor epsilon munu in terms of elongation, shortening or angular distortion of an equivalent elastic medium, modeling the behavior of space-time. By this synthetic ensemble approach and this elastic analogy, it appears clearly for the first time that some components of this tensor $h_{\mu\nu}$ remain to be determined and measured in adequacy with potential new phenomena or modified versions of general relativity in a weak field.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit Coincident General Relativity (CGR) in the gauge approach to gravity based on Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity (STEGR) in the {\it internal-space formulation}, which one of the authors recently proposed in Ref.~[J. Math. Phys. 66 (2025) 5, 052505]. First, we review the standard formulation of STEGR theories in the Palatini approach to gravity, in which formulation we impose the teleparallel and torsion-free conditions by using Lagrange multipliers. Second, we introduce the STEGR theories in the gauge approach to gravity, which is formulated in the internal space, and derive its field equations. We briefly discuss whether the Ostrogradski ghost instability exists and find that the theory may require a degenerate condition to be imposed. Finally, assuming the coincident gauge, we derive CGR in both terms of the action integral and the field equation. Discussing the possible kinematics of the STEGR theory, we formulate a motion of a test scalar particle in the spacetime with non-metricity.

 - **Abstract**
 A black hole binary approaching merger undergoes changes in its inspiral rate as energy and angular momentum are lost from the orbits into the horizons. This effect strengthens as the black holes come closer. We use numerical relativity data to model this so-called tidal heating in the strong gravity regime. We present a frequency-domain approximant for nonspinning black hole binaries that accounts for tidal heating effects up to the merger frequency. The approximant includes horizon parameters that characterize the nature of the compact objects. By applying this model to a binary black hole baseline that incorporates tidal heating, one can construct a more accurate point-particle waveform, one that is devoid of finite-size effects of the component objects. We also discuss its ramifications in modeling binary neutron star systems.
