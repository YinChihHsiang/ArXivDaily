#### CWT-LSTM Autoencoder: A Novel Approach for Gravitational Wave Detection in Synthetic Data

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning approach combining Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection in synthetic data. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. The LSTM autoencoder learns compressed representations while maintaining sensitivity to subtle signal features distinguishing true astrophysical events from noise artifacts. We generate realistic synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses, embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics: 92.3 percent precision, 67.6 percent recall, and 80.6 percent AUC-ROC, with an average precision score of 0.780. These results exceed LIGO's stringent detection thresholds for confident gravitational wave identification. Compared to traditional approaches, the CWT-LSTM autoencoder shows superior ability to maintain low false alarm rates while preserving sensitivity to weak signals. The method's end-to-end learning eliminates hand-crafted features and template banks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust gravitational wave detection systems. The unsupervised nature enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies, providing complementary "blind search" capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of gravitational-wave (GW) recoil on the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe. Forming ~10^9 Msun SMBHs by z ~ 6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model (Sassano et al. 2021) by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli et al. 2007; Lousto et al. 2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Pop III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by ~20-30% by z = 6 and creates a population of off-nuclear ("wandering") BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets ~0.1 arcsec and line-of-sight velocity shifts ~10^2-10^3 km/s in a few percent of high-z quasars. All code is publicly available at this https URL

 - **Abstract**
 Periodic variability in active galactic nuclei (AGN) light curves has been proposed as a signature of close supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. Recently, 181 candidate SMBH binaries were identified in Gaia DR3 based on periodicity in their $\sim$1000-day light curves. By supplementing Gaia photometry with longer-baseline light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey (CRTS), we test whether the reported periodic signals persist beyond the Gaia DR3 time window. We find that in all 116 cases with available ZTF data, the Gaia-inferred periodic model fails to predict subsequent variability, which appears stochastic rather than periodic. The periodic candidates thus overwhelmingly appear to be false positives; red noise contamination appears to be the primary source of false detections. We conclude that truly periodic AGN are exceedingly rare, with at most a few in $10^6$ AGN exhibiting stable periodicity on 100 to 1000 day timescales. Models predict that the Gaia AGN light curve sample should contain dozens of true SMBH binaries with periods within the observational baseline, so the lack of strictly periodic light curves in the sample suggests that most short-period binary AGN do not have light curves dominated by simple periodicity.

 - **Abstract**
 V723 Mon is a high mass function (f=1.7Msun) single lined spectroscopic binary with a red giant primary that Jayasinghe et al. (2021) suggested had a black hole as its massive companion. Unfortunately, el-Badry et al. (2022) demonstrated that it had a hotter stellar companion whose detectability in optical spectra was difficult due to its rapid rotation. Here we confirm the presence of the stellar companion with a Hubble Space Telescope STIS ultraviolet spectrum.

#### Assembling GW231123 in star clusters through the combination of stellar binary evolution and hierarchical mergers

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123 is the most massive binary black hole (BBH) merger detected to date by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. With at least one black hole (BH) in the upper-mass gap and both BHs exhibiting high spins ($\chi_{1,2} \gtrsim 0.8$), this event challenges standard isolated binary evolution models. A compelling alternative is a dynamical origin in star clusters, where stellar binaries and hierarchical mergers may both contribute to the formation of similar BBHs. In this work, we investigate the formation of GW231123-like events in different cluster environments using the B-POP semi-analytic population synthesis code. We find that low-metallicity environments ($Z \lesssim 0.002$) are ideal for producing BBH mergers similar to GW231123. In young and globular clusters, these BBHs have components formed in stellar binaries, whilst in nuclear clusters there is also a significant contribution from BHs built-up via hierarchical mergers. Natal spins of BHs formed in stellar binaries are crucial to find GW231123 analogs. In particular, our models suggest that BHs from stellar binaries are likely characterized by high-spins. Simulated GW231123-like systems exhibit short delay times, $t_\mathrm{del} \sim 0.1 - 1$ Gyr, which suggests their progenitors formed close to the inferred merger redshift ($z = 0.39^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$). We argue that star clusters in metal-poor dwarf galaxies or Milky Way-like galaxies are ideal nurseries, inferring an upper limit to the local merger rate of $\mathcal{R} \sim 1.6\times10^{-3} - 0.16$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ for nuclear clusters, $\sim 0.036 - 0.72$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ for globular clusters, and $4\times10^{-4}-0.041$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ for young clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Every large galaxy has a black hole in its center. The interaction between the black hole and their host profoundly shapes galactic evolution and the Universe as a whole. The key feature of this interaction are black hole jets - or more generally winds - which every black hole must have. Despite our Galaxy's central black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), proximity and importance, the active wind from it has eluded scientists for over half a century. Here we report the discovery of a large active wind from Sgr A* using unprecedentedly deep observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). We detect a large conical clearing in the cold molecular gas surrounding Sgr A* that is at least 1 parsec in length and has a 45-degree opening angle. The morphology and energetics of this structure are consistent with active clearing by a hot wind from Sgr A*. This finding resolves the long-standing mystery of the missing wind from Sgr A*, and delivers the most detailed look yet of black hole feeding and feedback processes in our Galactic center.

#### Radiation GRMHD Models of Accretion onto Stellar-Mass Black Holes: II. Super-Eddington Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of super-Eddington black hole accretion simulations that solve the GRMHD equations coupled with angle-discretized radiation transport. The simulations span a range of accretion rates, two black hole spins, and two magnetic field topologies, and include resolution studies as well as comparisons with non-radiative models. Super-Eddington accretion flows consistently develop geometrically thick disks supported by radiation pressure, regardless of magnetic field configuration. Radiation generated in the inner disk drives substantial outflows, forming conical funnel regions that limit photon escape and result in very low radiation efficiency. The accretion flows are highly turbulent with thermal energy transport dominated by radiation advection rather than diffusion. Angular momentum is primarily carried outward by Maxwell stress, with turbulent Reynolds stress playing a subdominant role. Both strong and weak jets are produced. Strong jets arise from sufficient net vertical magnetic flux and rapid black hole spin and can effectively evacuate the funnel, enabling radiation to escape through strong geometric beaming. In contrast, weak jets fail to clear the funnel, which becomes obscured by radiation-driven outflows and leads to distinct observational signatures. Spiral structures are observed in the plunging region, behaving like density waves. These super-Eddington models are applicable to a variety of astronomical systems, including ultraluminous X-ray sources, little red dots, and black hole transients.

 - **Abstract**
 When black hole jets encounter ambient medium, they can compress the gas, trigger star formation, and create stellar clusters containing tens of thousands of stars. Here, we report a remarkable discovery of such a phenomenon that happened just 2.2 billion years after the Big Bang, during the Cosmic Noon era. Quasar SDSSJ141924.44+532315.5, powered by a one-billion-solar-mass black hole, is seen blasting a powerful jet that interacts with a hypermassive gas reservoir, creating a fascinating, clumpy, arc- like structure spanning over 250 kiloparsecs in projected length, consisting of at least eight clumps. Each clump contains billions of stars, is as massive as the Milky Way, and exhibits extreme levels of star formation. We interpret these findings as fragmentation of a cosmic filament triggered by a jet overpressurized expanding cocoon, which leads to the birth of protogalaxies, a process observed at scales never seen before. We find that the physical conditions within the filament are favorable for a fragmentation scenario to occur. We also discuss the survivability and evolution of individual clumps in the context of unsolved galaxy formation theory problems.

 - **Abstract**
 Microlensing is one of the most powerful tools for probing the nature of dark halo objects and the sources they lens. As our nearest massive galaxy, M31 provides a rich source population with many potential lenses in its halo crossing our field of view at any one time. In this paper we explore the probability that X-ray sources in M31 will be lensed by white dwarfs in M31's halo. We find an expected lensing rate of 2.6/year within the mean archival Swift XRT field-of-view, and 6.3/year for the whole galaxy. For X-ray emitting sources harboring accreting neutron stars and black holes, we find that microlensing offers a unique opportunity to constrain the properties of the inner accretion flow. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to recover both the spin of the black hole and the temperature profile of the accretion disk by discerning their effects upon the profile of the microlensing magnification. We show that these parameters have a significant effect on the shape of the light curve, with the effect of spin being more pronounced at smaller impact parameters and higher energies, while the effect of the temperature profile is larger at lower energies and larger impact parameters. This suggests that multi-band observations of a single lensing event could be used to robustly constrain both parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Early JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of high-redshift candidate massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 7$, and recent DESI measurements show a preference for dynamical dark energy, which together present a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In this work, we jointly analyze high-redshift galaxy data from JWST, baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI DR2, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT, measuring the total neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$. We consider three dark energy models ($\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM) and three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of $\sum m_{\nu}$ by about $5.8\%-10.2\%$, and we obtain $\sum m_{\nu} < 0.167~\mathrm{eV}$ ($2\sigma$) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case. Furthermore, JWST also offers indicative lower limits on star formation efficiency parameter of $f_{*,10} \gtrsim 0.146-0.161$. Bayesian evidence weakly favors the $w_0w_a$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model relative to the $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model using CMB+DESI+JWST data. These results suggest that the joint analysis of high-redshift JWST data and low-redshift DESI data provides compelling constraints on neutrino mass and merits further investigation.

#### Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) and The Signatures of Cosmic Non-Gaussianity

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the small-scale primordial Uni- verse and may constitute a fraction of the dark matter. Their formation is highly sensitive to non-Gaussian features in the primordial curvature perturbation {\zeta}. In this work we inves- tigate PBH production in the curvaton scenario, where the decay of a late-time light scalar field imprints large, inherently non-Gaussian fluctuations on small scales. Using the exact non-linear mapping between the Gaussian curvaton field perturbations and {\zeta}, we compute the full non-perturbative probability distribution functions of {\zeta} and derive the PBH for- mation fraction \b{eta} without relying on a truncated non-Gaussian expansion. We show that the enhanced tail of the distribution dramatically amplifies PBH production, leading to an exponential sensitivity of \b{eta} to the curvaton decay fraction {\Omega}\c{hi},dec. By modeling the scale dependence of curvaton fluctuations with a lognormal profile, we obtain realistic, extended PBH mass spectra rather than monochromatic peaks. We further highlight the associated stochastic gravitational-wave background induced at second order, whose peak frequency correlates directly with the PBH mass scale. Our results demonstrate that the curvaton scenario naturally produces a rich phenomenology of PBHs and gravitational waves, sharply distinct from Gaussian single-field inflation models, and provide a framework for connecting small-scale non-Gaussian physics to upcoming gravitational-wave and PBH observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of dust shielding on Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation fields and its implications for supermassive black hole (SMBH) seed formation at high redshift. Using an updated version of the GAMETE/QSOdust semi-analytical model, we implement a simple dust shielding prescription that accounts for the absorption of LW photons by dust grains. We find that even modest dust enrichment can significantly reduce the effective LW radiation field, allowing H2 cooling to persist in regions previously thought to be affected by LW feedback. This changes the conditions for seed formation, particularly for heavy seeds which require suppression of H2 cooling. Our results suggest that dust shielding extends the redshift range and volume where heavy seeds can form, and significantly alters the relative importance of different seed populations. We discuss the implications for the formation of high-redshift SMBHs and future observations.

#### Simulations of Tidal Disruption of Supernova in Galaxy Nuclear Region: A Novel Model for Ambiguous Nuclear Transients

 - **Abstract**
 An increasing number of ambiguous nuclear transients, including some extreme nuclear transients, have been reported, which cannot be simply explained by the tidal disruption event (TDE) due to their high energy and/or overmassive black holes. Stars that form in or are captured by AGN disks will grow and migrate inward, potentially exploding as supernovae once the inner cold accretion disk disappears during the phase of AGN decay. We propose that tidal disruption of a supernova (TDS) by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can produce nuclear transients that are even more luminous than typical TDEs and are not limited by the SMBH mass. In this scenario, the SMBH can capture the supernova ejecta, which subsequently self-intersects and circularizes into an accretion disk. Based on hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the accretion rate of the TDS disk exhibits a slow decline that can last for months to decades. The peak accretion rate of a typical core-collapse SN scenario can exceed the Eddington limit for SMBHs with $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{7.5}\,M_\odot$, while it remains sub-Eddington for more massive SMBHs. This model provides a mechanism for triggering an energetic TDE-like flare with luminosity \(\gtrsim10^{45}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}\) in galaxies with $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{8}\,M_\odot$ or triggering turn-on changing-look AGNs.

 - **Abstract**
 The appearance of a black hole shadow, in both astronomical observations and theoretical analysis, depends critically on the properties of the surrounding accretion. In this study, we analyse the emission and observational properties of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Hernquist dark matter (DM) halo by considering three simplified accretion models, which have not been previously explored in such detail. Based on our findings, direct emission contributes markedly to the whole observed intensity for a Schwarzschild-Hernquist black hole encircled by a geometrically thin accretion disk. The corresponding regions and measured intensities of the lensing ring, the photon ring, and direct emission are sensitive to the parameters of the Hernquist DM halo. Apart from disk accretion, we also study two spherical accretion models: static and infalling. With increasing Hernquist DM parameters, both models exhibit a significant decrease in the measured intensity, yet the photon spheres are enlarged by an increase of $\sim2\%$ to $\sim30\%$. Furthermore, Doppler de-boosting due to the infalling accretion results in darker shadow images compared to static cases. By precising visualisations of the shadows, our results suggest that the observational characteristics of black hole shadows can serve as a powerful probe for distinguishing between different DM distributions around supermassive black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Self-lensing (SL) in binary systems has the potential to provide a unique observational window into the Galactic population of compact objects. Using the $\mathtt{startrack}$ and COSMIC population synthesis codes, we investigate how different supernova mechanisms affect the observable population of SL systems, with particular attention to the mass gap (2$\mathrm{-}$5 M$_\odot$) in compact object distributions. We test three supernova remnant formation models with different convective growth timescales ($f_{\rm mix}$ = 0.5, 1.0, and 4.0), simulating SL binary systems across the Galactic disk and bulge. We identify distinct groupings of SL sources based on lens mass and Einstein crossing time, clearly differentiating neutron star from black hole systems and close from wide orbits. Notably, the delayed $f_{\rm mix} = 0.5$ model predicts a significantly higher fraction of systems with lens masses in the mass gap region (up to $\sim10$ times more for certain surveys), suggesting that SL observations could help constrain this controversial population. Our analysis reveals a strong preference for systems with low centre-of-mass velocities ($v_{\rm cm}\leq20$ km/s) across all models, resulting primarily from physical processes governing compact object formation and binary survival. While many potential detections will have limited observational coverage, ZTF is predicted to yield several dozen well-covered systems that should enable detailed characterization. When applying simple detection criteria including photometric precision and signal-to-noise requirements, predicted rates decrease by approximately two orders of magnitude, but still yield up to a few tens of expected detections for LSST and ZTF in the Galactic disk population.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the formation and evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) requires a thorough investigation of the key physical processes involved. While one pathway involves the isolated evolution of massive binary stars, affected by uncertain stages like core-collapse supernovae and common envelope evolution, an alternative channel is dynamical formation in dense stellar environments. Newtonian gravity has traditionally provided a robust and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale gravitational interactions. However, accurately capturing close encounters and black hole mergers necessitates the use of general relativity. This work focuses on assessing the applicability of post-Newtonian gravity in bridging these regimes, offering a physically insightful and computationally tractable approach to modeling BBH formation in the gravitational-wave era of astronomy.

#### Testing CCC+TL Cosmology with Galaxy Rotation Curves

 - **Abstract**
 This paper aims to explore whether astrophysical observations, primarily galaxy rotation curves, result from covarying coupling constants (CCC) rather than from dark matter. We have shown in earlier papers that cosmological observations, such as supernovae type 1a (Pantheon+), the small size of galaxies at cosmic dawn, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the sound horizon in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and time dilation effect, can be easily accounted for without requiring dark energy and dark matter when coupling constants are permitted to evolve in an expanding Universe, as predicted by Dirac, and the redshift is considered jointly due to the Universe's expansion and Zwicky's tired light (TL) effect. Here, we show that the CCC parameter {\alpha} is responsible for generating the illusion of dark matter and dark energy, which we call {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy, and is influenced by the baryonic matter density distribution. While cosmologically {\alpha} is a constant determined for the homogenous and isotropic Universe, e.g., by fitting Pantheon+ data, it can vary locally due to the extreme anisotropy of the matter distribution. Thus, in high baryonic density regions, one expects {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy densities to be relatively low and vice versa. We present its application to a few galaxy rotation curves from the SPARC database and find the results promising.

 - **Abstract**
 It is commonly recognized that the primordial scalar spectral index $n_s$ is approximately $0.96-0.975$, depending on the dataset. However, this view is being completely altered by the early dark energy (EDE) resolutions of the Hubble tension, known as the most prominent tension the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is suffering from. In corresponding models with pre-recombination EDE, resolving the Hubble tension (i.e., achieving $H_0\sim 73$km/s/Mpc) must be accompanied by a shift of $n_s$ towards unity to maintain consistency with the cosmological data, which thus implies a scale invariant Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum with $n_s=1$ $(|n_s-1|\simeq {\cal O}(0.001))$. In this work, we strengthen and reconfirm this result with the latest ground-based CMB data from ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1, the precise measurements at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. Our work again highlights the importance of re-examining our understanding on the very early Universe within the broader context of cosmological tensions.

#### The dependence of the Type Ia Supernova colour-luminosity relation on their host galaxy properties

 - **Abstract**
 Using the Dark Energy Survey 5-year sample, we determine the properties of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) host galaxies across a wide multi-wavelength range - from the optical to far-infrared - including data from the $Herschel$ and $Spitzer$ space telescopes. We categorise the SNe Ia into three distinct groups according to the distribution of their host galaxies on the star-formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass ($M_\star$) plane. Each region comprises host galaxies at distinct stages in their evolutionary pathways: Region 1 - low-mass hosts; Region 2 - high-mass, star-forming hosts and Region 3 - high-mass, passive hosts. We find SNe Ia in host galaxies located in Region 1 have the steepest slope (quantified by $\beta$) between their colours and luminosities, with $\beta_{\mathrm{R_1}} = 3.51 \pm 0.16$. This differs at the ${\sim}6\sigma$ significance level to SNe Ia in Region 3, which have the shallowest colour-luminosity slope with $\beta_{\mathrm{R_3}} = 2.12 \pm 0.16$. After correcting SNe Ia in each subsample by their respective $\beta$, events in Region 3 (high-mass, passive hosts) are $0.07 - 0.12$ mag ($>3\sigma$) brighter, post-standardisation. We conclude that future cosmological analyses should apply standardisation relations to SNe Ia based upon the region in which the SN host galaxy lies in the SFR-$M_\star$ plane. Alternatively, cosmological analyses should restrict the SN Ia sample to events whose host galaxies occupy a single region of this plane.

 We conducted an extensive long-term spectral and timing study of the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) M74 X-1, using data taken between 2001 and 2021 by Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observatories. Our analysis shows that flares are present in some observations, whereas they are absent in others. Flaring state exhibits two-component spectra at a lower average flux level, whereas the non-flaring state displays single-component spectra at a higher average flux level. The M74 X-1 spectra are best described by the combination of accretion disk and Comptonization components, a dual thermal disk blackbody model, and a modified multi-temperature disk blackbody model. Using the dual thermal disk blackbody model, we obtain cool and hot temperatures of $T_{in}$ (cool) = $0.38^{+0.08}_{-0.06}$ keV and $T_{in}$ (hot) = $1.67^{+0.18}_{-0.13}$ keV, respectively, suggesting two temperature emitting regions and indicating possible presence of outflowing wind along with the accretion disk. We found a Gaussian feature at $E_{line}$ = $0.96^{+0.05}_{-0.11}$ keV with $\sigma$ = $0.11^{+0.13}_{-0.06}$ keV in the spectra of the flaring state which can be interpreted as the unresolved wind feature in the system when compared to similar feature seen in other ULXs. Plotting the hardness luminosity diagram, we get a trend of increasing hardness with luminosity, suggesting the presence of geometrical beaming in a low-inclination system. Additionally, using the hot disk blackbody component from the dual thermal disk blackbody model, we estimate the mass of the compact object to be M = $7.1^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$ M$_\odot$, classifying it as a stellar-mass black hole and confirming super-Eddington accretion in the system.

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarfs with infrared excess emission provide a window into the late stages of stellar evolution and the dynamics of circumstellar environments. Using data from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX), we characterized 30 white dwarfs exhibiting infrared excess, including 29 DA and 1 DB stars. While an infrared excess can arise from dusty disks or cool (sub-)stellar companions, our sample is limited to stellar companions due to our selection based on SDSS photometry, which is sensitive to excess emission at wavelengths $\lambda < 1\,\mu\mathrm{m}$. Our sample contains 22 newly identified excess sources not previously reported in the literature. Spectroscopic observations are available for 10 sources via SDSS, of which only 8 have prior spectroscopic classifications in the literature. In this paper, we present the determination of the effective temperature and surface gravity of these white dwarfs. We used the Balmer line profiles to compare with current atmospheric models to determine the photospheric parameters of the white dwarfs, minimizing contamination introduced by the infrared source. We used photometric data from the SDSS and the \textit{Gaia} mission to resolve the degeneracies between hot and cold solutions from spectroscopy, constraining the photospheric parameters. These results help refine our understanding of white dwarf evolution in binary systems, focusing on stellar companions that cause the infrared excess. This study contributes to identifying systems with potential substellar companions or unresolved stellar partners, adding to the growing effort to map out the fate of planetary systems after their host stars evolve beyond the main sequence.

 - **Abstract**
 The current cosmological model, known as the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model (or $\Lambda$CDM for short) is one of the most astonishing accomplishments of contemporary theoretical physics. It is a well-defined mathematical model which depends on very few ingredients and parameters and is able to make a range of predictions and postdictions with astonishing accuracy. It is built out of well-known physics - general relativity, quantum mechanics and atomic physics, statistical mechanics and thermodynamics - and predicts the existence of new, unseen components. Again and again it has been shown to fit new data sets with remarkable precision. Despite these successes, we have yet to understand the unseen components of the Universe and there has been evidence for inconsistencies in the model. In these lectures, we lay the foundations of modern cosmology.

#### Detecting regular precession using a new gravitational waveform model directly parameterized by both precession amplitude and frequency

 - **Abstract**
 Nearly 210 binary black hole (BBH) mergers have been observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network during its four observing runs. Generic BBHs are spinning, and their spins are misaligned with the orbital angular momentum $\vec{L}$. These misaligned spins cause $\vec{L}$ to precess in a cone with dimensionless precession amplitude $\tilde{\theta}$ and frequency $\tilde{\Omega}$ about the nearly constant direction of the total angular momentum. This precession modulates the observed GWs. We propose a model of regularly precessing (RP) waveforms that incorporates $\tilde{\theta}$ and $\tilde{\Omega}$ directly as parameters. We investigate how these waveforms vary as functions of these precessional parameters, as well as binary orientation and sky location. We use the Lindblom criterion to estimate that precession can be detected in a RP source with signal-to-noise ratio $\rho$ when the mismatch $\epsilon$ with a non-precessing (NP) source with otherwise identical parameters exceeds $1/2\rho^2$. Precession is most detectable when $\vec{L}$ precesses through configurations we call +~nulls during the inspiral. At +~nulls, a NP source only emits +-polarization to which the GW detector is insensitive. The large mismatch between a RP source and this vanishing NP signal enhances the detectability of precession. We also explore the detectability of precession as a function of redshift $z$ for different BBH populations. We find that for BBHs with isotropically oriented maximal spins, precession is detectable in a majority of systems out to $z \approx 0.3$ for chirp masses $10 \lesssim M_c/M_\odot \lesssim 40$ and mass ratios $q \gtrsim 0.5$. Reduced spin magnitudes or greater alignment between the spins and $\vec{L}$ make it difficult to observe beyond $z \approx 0.1$. (abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Spin-induced deformations of individual components of a binary can be quantified using the gravitational wave signal the binary emits. Such deformations are characterised by a parameter, $ \kappa $, which takes a value of 1 for a black hole and thus its measurement can be used to test the no-hair conjecture. However, in practice, only a symmetric combination of this parameter for a binary ($ \kappa_s $) can be measured, thus instead enabling a test for the no-hair conjecture in the context of a binary black hole system; see for instance, Krishnendu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 091101 (2017), arXiv:1701.06318. While previous studies have focused on circular binaries, we extend this test to eccentric systems in a Fisher matrix based analysis. We find that the error in the measurement of the parameter $ \kappa_s $ reduces from a value of about 18% (for the circular case) to close to 8% (4%) for a $ 10 M_{\odot} $ system with dimensionless component spins $ >0.8 $ and with a reference initial eccentricity ($ e_0 $) of 0.2 (0.4) evaluated at 5 Hz for a third generation detector, Cosmic Explorer (CE). Compared to the estimates obtained by using Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, eccentricity and the overall improved sensitivity of CE detectors together seem to improve these estimates almost by an order of magnitude.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive and analyze a Schwarzschild-like Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) obtained as a static, spherically symmetric solution of Einstein's equations sourced by a cloud of strings (CoS) and a dark matter (DM) halo modeled by a Dehnen-type density profile. We first study the geodesic motion of massless and massive test particles, emphasizing how the CoS parameter $\alpha$ and the DM halo parameters $(\rho_s, r_s)$ influence photon spheres, circular orbits, the BH shadow, and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). We then examine scalar perturbations via the effective potential and the associated quasinormal-mode (QNM) spectra, showing how $\alpha$ and $(\rho_s, r_s)$ deform oscillation frequencies and damping rates, thereby affecting stability diagnostics. Furthermore, we investigate the thermodynamics in the extended phase space, deriving the Hawking temperature, equation of state, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity, and establishing a consistent first law and Smarr relation with natural work terms for $\alpha$ and $(\rho_s, r_s)$. We find that the interplay between the CoS and the DM halo produces quantitative and sometimes qualitative changes in both dynamical and thermodynamical properties, including shifts of the Hawking--Page transition and heat-capacity divergences, thus reshaping the phase structure of Schwarzschild--AdS BHs.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate black hole superradiance evolution of the interacting multiple fields. We consider a model of two scalar fields interacting with a cubic coupling, and study the superradiant evolution of the cloud. We demonstrate that superradiance is typically suppressed when the superradiant field couples to another field, even with a very weak coupling strength. This implies that the constraints on dark particles derived from single-field analyses can be revised in the presence of interactions. Moreover, we find that the multi-field superradiant evolution and its corresponding observational signatures can be different across parameter spaces, which makes black hole superradiance an even more powerful probe of the dark sector in particle physics.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study a self-dual black hole (BH) in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), analyzing both timelike and null geodesics. Using observational data from Mercury's perihelion shift and the orbit of the S2 star around Sagittarius A$^{\star}$ (Sgr A$^{\star}$), we derive constraints on the polymeric function $P$. We further investigate photon trajectories near the self-dual BH under various scenarios to explore their observational relevance. Finally, we examine the properties of accretion disks around the self-dual BH in LQG, including their direct and secondary images, and study the redshift and the observed energy flux distribution across the accretion disk as measured by distant observers for different inclination angles. Our findings provide new insights into the physical nature and accretion properties of self-dual BHs in LQG and their possible observational consequences.

 - **Abstract**
 We study axial gravitational perturbations of the Dymnikova regular black hole, an asymptotically flat spacetime in which the Schwarzschild singularity is replaced by a de Sitter core. Using the WKB method with Padé approximants, we compute grey-body factors, and absorption cross-sections, and test the recently proposed correspondence between quasinormal frequencies and transmission coefficients. We find that variations of the quantum parameter \(l_{\rm cr}\) affect the effective potential only near the horizon, leading to minor deviations of grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections from the Schwarzschild case. As a result, the Hawking radiation spectrum is governed mainly by the modified Hawking temperature, with grey-body factors providing only subleading corrections. Unlike higher quasinormal overtones, which are highly sensitive to near-horizon deformations, the grey-body factors remain robust, a feature explicitly confirmed for the Dymnikova geometry. The correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors holds in our case with high accuracy for multipoles $\ell \geq 2$.

 We analytically solve the constraints in General Relativity for two black holes with arbitrary momenta and spin up to third order in these parameters. We compute the location and geometry of the apparent horizon, which depend on the spins, momenta, relative orientation angles, and the separation between the black holes, and present the result in a coordinate-independent form. We also extract the ADM mass and the irreducible mass and verify their consistency. The final expressions are depicted in a coordinate-independent form. The results can be easily extended to any number of black holes and used to complement numerical relativity simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 In this manuscript, I discuss the possibility of sending a small probe to the closest black hole with the goal of addressing some fundamental questions of modern physics. Are astrophysical black holes the Kerr black holes predicted by General Relativity? Do astrophysical black holes have an event horizon? Is the physics around a black hole the same physics as in our laboratories on Earth? While we do not have the technology for a similar mission today, it may be available in the next 20-30 years. The whole mission may last up to a century (depending on the actual distance of the black hole and the speed of the probe), but it may represent a unique opportunity to perform precise and accurate tests of General Relativity in the strong field regime.

#### Gravitational collapse with torsion and universe in a black hole

 - **Abstract**
 We consider gravitational collapse of a fluid sphere with torsion generated by spin, which forms a black hole. We use the Tolman metric and the Einstein$-$Cartan field equations with a relativistic spin fluid as a source. We show that gravitational repulsion of torsion prevents a singularity, replacing it with a nonsingular bounce. Quantum particle creation during contraction prevents shear from overcoming torsion. Particle creation during expansion can generate a finite period of inflation and produce large amounts of matter. The resulting closed universe on the other side of the event horizon may have several bounces. Such a universe is oscillatory, with each cycle larger than the preceding cycle, until it reaches a size at which dark energy dominates and expands indefinitely. Our Universe might have therefore originated from a black hole existing in another universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a theoretical study of the magnetic field generated by a toroidal current loop situated in the equatorial plane of a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole, based on the dynamics of charged particles. Using the exact general relativistic solution for the magnetic field, we analyze particle motion both analytically and numerically, identifying regions of stable and unstable orbits. In particular, we classify charged particle dynamics into attractive and repulsive Lorentz force configurations and show that in the attractive case, charged particles can accumulate near the current loop, forming collective currents that oppose the original current loop magnetic field. We demonstrate that charged particle accumulation can lead to the formation of toroidal structures analogous to radiation belts in the BH magnetosphere. We compare the curved spacetime solution to flat spacetime analogs and highlight general relativistic effects such as the existence of the innermost stable circular orbit for charged particles, which sets a lower bound for radiation belt formation. The divergence of the vector potential at the loop location in the idealized infinitesimal loop model is addressed, and we argue that a physically realistic model must consider a finite-width current distribution to avoid unphysical divergences in the effective potential.

 - **Abstract**
 Within a semiclassical framework, we investigate spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein equations that (i) develop a trapped region within a finite time as measured by distant observers, and (ii) remain sufficiently regular at the apparent horizon. These requirements characterize the self-consistent approach, and it imposes specific constraints on the limiting form of the energy momentum tensor (EMT). Previous works argued that only certain EMT classes admit viable dynamical solutions, while discarding others (see, e.g., Terno 2020) based on reasoning that is not entirely robust. Here, we explicitly demonstrate that the discarded classes are indeed unphysical. In addition, we also introduce a new class of static solutions that are regular at the horizon and allow finite-time horizon crossing according to a distant observer.

 - **Abstract**
 This work aims to explore the gravitational consequences of a recently proposed black hole solution presented in the literature [Phys. Dark Univ. 50 (2025) 102061]. We initiate our analyzes by taking into account the horizon structure, focusing on both the event and Cauchy horizons. Subsequently, we examine the quasinormal modes by considering all types of perturbations -- scalar, vector, tensor, and spinorial. To strengthen these results, we also compute the time-domain for each perturbation. Next, we turn to the study of optical properties of the black hole. In particular, we investigate null geodesics, the photon sphere and its stability, as well as the corresponding black hole shadows. Following this, we analyze gravitational lensing phenomena in two regimes: the weak-field limit, utilizing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and the strong deflection limit, employing Tsukamoto's approach. In addition, we confront the lensing observables with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data for $Sgr A^{*}$ and $M87^{*}$. Finally, constraints on the parameter $\xi$ -- which is introduced by higher-order curvature-scalar gravity, thereby differing from the Schwarzschild solution -- are estimated using Solar System measurements such as the precession of Mercury's orbit, gravitational light bending, and time delay (or Shapiro effect).

 - **Abstract**
 This paper systematically investigates the quasinormal modes (QNMs) and tidal Love numbers of covariant quantum-modified black holes (BHs) within two cosmological constant-dependent metric frameworks. By deriving axial/polar perturbation equations and employing pseudospectral methods (for QNMs) and numerical integration (for Love numbers), we quantify the quantum parameter $\zeta$'s influence. We find that, higher overtones exhibit enhanced $\zeta$ sensitivity. Solution 1 maintains purely imaginary QNMs under $\zeta$ variation, whereas Solution 2 demonstrates mode transitions from real to complex for polar/axial perturbations. Furthermore, for Love number, axial perturbations show non-monotonic $\zeta$ dependence, with $\Delta\mathcal{T}^a_l$ peaking at specific $\ell$ values before decay. While for polar perturbation of the same metric displays strictly monotonic $\zeta$ effects on $\Delta\mathcal{T}^p_l$. These results highlight quantum gravity's role in BH perturbation dynamics and cosmological BH phenomenology.

 We perform a Lie symmetry analysis on the tempered-fractional Keller Segel (TFKS) system, a chemo- taxis model incorporating anomalous diffusion. A novel approach is used to handle the nonlocal nature of tempered fractional operators. By deriving the full set of Lie point symmetries and identifying the optimal one-dimensional subalgebras, we reduce the TFKS PDEs to ordinary differential equations (ODEs), yielding new exact solutions. These results offer insights into the long-term behavior and aggregation dynamics of the TFKS model and present a methodology applicable to other tempered fractional differential equations.

 - **Abstract**
 We formulate the classical gravitational entropy of a horizon as a Noether charge that does not require the notion of a temperature, and which is applicable to horizons that are not necessarily associated with black holes. This introduces a correction to the covariant phase space formalism that accounts for the configuration-dependence of the generating vector field conjugate to the charge. The vector field is related to the proposal of Bousso that the gravitational entropy of a region is determined by the lightsheet at its boundary. We test the formula on various black hole and cosmological horizons.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by certain recent works, we study thermodynamic and optical properties of the Reissner-Nordström-AdS black holes in a noncommutative spacetime with a string cloud and quintessence dark fields. After analyzing the global and the local stabilities, we examine the criticality and the Joule-Thomson expansion behaviors in such noncommutative backgrounds. Concretely, we find that the critical universal numbers X_N can be expressed as X_0 + NX, where N is the quintessence parameter and X_0 is the critical universal number of the Reissner-Nordström-AdS black holes in a NC spacetime without additional external fields. Furthermore, we find that Van der Waals behaviors can be recovered by strictly constraining the charge in terms of external parameters. To conclude this work, we compute and examine the deflection angle of lights in such a modified spacetime geometry.

 - **Abstract**
 Bumblebee models, a class of vector-tensor theories in which a vector field acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value that spontaneously breaks spacetime symmetries, are ubiquitous in the literature. In this paper, we highlight several often-overlooked properties of these models by analyzing their cosmological perturbations. We show that a non-minimal coupling to gravity is essential for the stability of the setup. However, avoiding propagation of a ghost mode then requires imposing a relation between the coupling coefficients, known as the degeneracy condition, which reduces the bumblebee model to a subset of generalized Proca theories with a marginal non-minimal operator. By imposing the degeneracy condition, the vector field becomes non-dynamical at the background level, and the form of its potential is completely fixed in vacuum. We show that the vacuum expectation value of the vector field can drive a de Sitter solution, for which the effects of the non-minimal coupling are negligible at the background level but provide essential order-one corrections to the sound speed of the scalar mode, keeping the setup weakly coupled at the level of perturbations. Treating this stealth de Sitter solution as a dark energy candidate, we study its coupling to matter and find the effective gravitational coupling for the matter density contrast in the quasi-static regime. At the level of perturbations, the system behaves differently from $\Lambda$CDM, providing a potential observational signature to distinguish the two models.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a framework based on modern amplitude techniques to analyze emission and absorption effects in black hole physics, including Hawking radiation. We first discuss quantum field theory on a Schwarzschild background in the Boulware and Unruh vacua, and introduce the corresponding $S$-matrices. We use this information to determine on-shell absorptive amplitudes describing processes where a black hole transitions to a different mass state by absorbing or emitting quanta, to all orders in gravitational coupling. This on-shell approach allows for a universal description of black holes, with their intrinsic differences encapsulated in the discontinuities of the amplitudes, without suffering from off-shell ambiguities such as gauge freedom. Furthermore, the absorptive amplitudes serve as building blocks to describe physics beyond that of isolated black holes. As applications, we find that the Hawking thermal spectrum is well understood by three-point processes. We also consider a binary system and compute the mass shift of a black hole induced by the motion of a companion object, including quantum effects. We show that the mean value of the mass shift is classical and vacuum-independent, while its variance differs depending on the vacuum choice. Our results provide confirmation of the validity of the on-shell program in advancing our understanding of black hole physics.
