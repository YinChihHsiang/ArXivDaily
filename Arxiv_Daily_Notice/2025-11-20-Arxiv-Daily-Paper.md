 - **Abstract**
 JWST/MIRI observations can place photometric limits on the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) near the Galactic Centre. The stellar complex IRS 13E, a co-moving conglomerate of young and massive stars, is a prime location to study because it has been speculated to be bound by an IMBH. Assuming a standard radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) and a minimum fractional variability of 10% of intrinsic luminosity, the wavelength of peak emission in the spectral energy distribution for an IMBH would lie in the mid-infrared ($\sim$ 5-25 $\mu$m), and variability would be detectable in MIRI time-series observations. Monitoring fails to detect such variable emission (other than from Sgr A*) in and around the IRS 13E complex, and upper limits on a putative IMBH's intrinsic variability on timescales of minutes to about 1 hour are $\lesssim$1 mJy at 12 $\mu$m and $\lesssim$2 mJy at 19 $\mu$m. These translate to luminosities $\lesssim 25 \times 10^{32}$ erg/s. The resulting limits on the IMBH mass and accretion rate rule out any IMBH with mass $\gtrsim 10^3$ M$_\odot$ accreting at $\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ times Eddington rate at the location of IRS 13E. Further, the observations rule out an IMBH anywhere in the central 6" $\times$ 6" region that is more massive than $\approx$ 2 $\times 10^3$ M$_\odot$ and accreting at $\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ of the Eddington rate. Assuming Bondi accretion scaled to typical RIAF-accretion efficiencies, albeit somewhat uncertain, also allows us to rule out IMBHs moving with typical velocities of about 200 km/s and masses $\gtrsim 2 \times 10^3$ M$_\odot$. These methods showcase the effectiveness of photometric variability measurements in constraining the presence of accreting black holes in Galactic centre-like environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Stars that orbit too close to a black hole can be ripped apart by strong tides, producing a type of luminous transient event called a ``tidal disruption event" (TDE). Tidal disruption events of stars by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) provide windows into the nuclei of galaxies at size scales that are difficult to observe directly outside our own galactic neighborhood. They provide a unique opportunity to study these supermassive black holes under feeding conditions that change dramatically over ~week-month timescales, and that regularly reach super-Eddington mass inflow rates. Their light curves are dependent on the properties of the disrupting black hole, and can be used to help constrain the lower mass end of the SMBH mass function -- a region of parameter space that is difficult to access with classic dynamical mass measurements.

#### Dynamics in the Cores of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos: Reduced Stalling and Accelerated Core Collapse

 - **Abstract**
 Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) is an intriguing alternative to the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm, which predicts that dark matter halos typically have large, isothermal cores. Numerical simulations have shown that dynamical friction ceases to operate in cores of (roughly) constant density, a phenomenon known as core stalling. In addition, such cores often are unstable to a dipole instability that gives rise to dynamical buoyancy, causing massive central objects to move outward. Thus far, these manifestations of core dynamics have only been demonstrated in collisionless systems. In this paper, we use idealized N-body simulations to study whether core stalling and dynamical buoyancy operate in SIDM halos. We find that if the self-interactions are sufficiently strong, neither core stalling nor buoyancy are present, and a massive perturber will quickly sink all the way to the center of its host. In doing so, it gravitationally contracts the core, catalyzing a strongly accelerated core collapse. The reason why core dynamics are so different in SIDM halos is that self-interactions drive the halo's distribution function to a featureless exponential, removing any inflections or plateaus that are responsible for the dipole instability and core stalling in the case of CDM. We discuss implications of our finding for constraining the nature of dark matter by using observations of massive objects such as supermassive black holes (SMBHs), globular clusters, and nuclear star clusters in the central regions of galaxies.

#### Constraining the Jet Energetics of the Transient X-ray Binaries MAXI J1348-630 and MAXI J1820+070 through Calorimetry

 - **Abstract**
 We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations aimed at identifying potential jet-ISM interaction sites in the vicinity of the transient black hole X-ray binaries MAXI J1348-630 and MAXI J1820+070, both of which have recently undergone an outburst, and displayed powerful large scale jets. Using this dataset, we construct molecular line emission maps. By analyzing the morphological, spectral, and kinematic properties of the detected emission, we identify a molecular structure that provides compelling evidence for a jet-driven cavity in the local environment of MAXI J1348-630 but find no significant emission in the local environment of MAXI J1820+070. We use the properties of the detected molecular emission surrounding MAXI J1348-630 to constrain the jet power, finding our results to be consistent with other independent studies of this source, and further validating the utility of astrochemistry for constraining jet energetics. Additionally, our findings provide the first assessment on the formation timescales for jet-ISM interaction regions in the transient black hole X-ray binary population.

#### Hyperaccretion-driven relativistic jets from massive collapsars in active galactic nucleus disks

 - **Abstract**
 The observable characteristics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) embedded in the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are mainly determined by the jet propagation within the disk. In the massive collapsar scenario, we consider that the mass and metallicity of progenitor stars can significantly affect the jet durations and luminosities, which in turn influence whether the jet can break out from AGN disks. For the cases with low metallicity, massive stars tend to keep their massive envelopes. Thus the hyperaccretion of these envelopes onto the newborn black holes (BHs) can prolong the activity duration of the central engine, thereby allowing the jets to potentially break out from the disks. For successful jets, we further study their prompt emission and afterglows for different supermassive BHs and locations and discuss the detectability of these signals by instruments such as \emph{Swift} and Einstein Probe. Future related observations will help constrain the structure, components, and evolutionary history of AGN disks and the massive stars embedded within them.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark energy plays a crucial role in the evolution of cosmic expansion. In most studies, dark energy is considered a single dynamic component. In fact, multi-component dark energy models may theoretically explain the accelerated expansion of the universe as well. In our previous research, we constructed the $w_{\rm{n}}$CDM ($n=2, 3, 5$) models and conducted numerical research, finding strong observational support when the value of n is small. Based on our results, both the $\chi^2$ and Akaike information criterion (AIC) favor the $w_{\rm{2}}$CDM model more than the $w_0w_{\rm{a}}$CDM model. However, previous studies were limited to two equal-component dark energy models, failing to consider the component proportions as variables. Therefore, we will further explore the $w_{\rm{2}}$CDM model. To simplify the model, we fix $w = -1$ in one component and set the other component to $w_{\rm{de2}}$, varying the proportions of both components in the population. Under different $w_{\rm{de2}}$, we obtain the one-dimensional distribution of ${H}_{0}$ with respect to $f_{\rm{de2}}$. Further fitting reveals the evolution of ${H}_{0}$ under varying $w_{\rm{de2}}$ and $f_{\rm{de2}}$. We also perform the same operation on $\chi^2$. To evaluate the error of fitting, we introduce two indicators, $\text{R}^{2}_{\text{adj}}$ and MAPE, to quantify the fitting ability of our models. We find that when $w_{\rm{de2}}$ is less than -1, ${H}_{0}$ increases with the decrease of $w_{\rm{de2}}$ and the increase of $f_{\rm{de2}}$, effectively alleviating ${H}_{0}$ tension. For $\chi^2$, it still prefers the $\Lambda$CDM model, and the $w_{\rm{2}}$CDM model will decrease significantly when it approaches the $\Lambda$CDM model. The excellent performance of $\text{R}^{2}_{\text{adj}}$ and MAPE further proves that our model has an outstanding fitting effect and extremely high reliability.

 - **Abstract**
 Ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors have discovered about 200 compact object mergers. The astrophysical origins of these events are highly debated, and it is possible that at least a fraction of them originate from dynamical environments. Among these, the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are particularly interesting as promising environments, as some observed properties may be more readily produced there. When compact objects merge in these environments, acceleration from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) or nearby companions is inevitable. Such acceleration induces a phase shift in the observed GW waveforms, which can serve as a useful tool to distinguish the underlying merging environments for each GW event. In this paper, we investigate the expected distribution of such acceleration-induced GW phase shifts, using a semi-analytical model combined with a one-dimensional AGN population synthesis code. We find significant contributions from three-body interactions involving a nearby third object. Our results indicate that the GW phase shift is likely to be larger compared to other channels, making it distinguishable by future GW facilities such as TianQin, DECIGO, Taiji, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic Explorer. Interestingly, a notable fraction of mergers in fact exhibit a significant GW phase shift ($\gtrsim~{\rm 1\ rad}$) at frequencies above $10~{\rm Hz}$, which could even be detectable by current GW detectors such as LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. Additionally, if gas-hardening during three-body interactions is taken into account, the GW frequency can be boosted to $\gtrsim 10~{\rm Hz}$, potentially further aiding in the detection of the phase shift.

#### Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. IV. Broad Emission Line Evolution Sequence Among Hα, Mg II, and Hβ

 - **Abstract**
 From a parent catalog of 561 changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) identified by Guo et al. (2025), we investigate the evolutionary sequence of broad emission lines using a redshift-selected subset (0.35 < z < 0.45) of 54 CL-AGNs whose Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) spectra simultaneously cover the H{\alpha}, H\b{eta}, and Mg II emission lines. To provide a baseline for comparison, we construct a control sample of 19,897 normal Type 1 AGNs within the same redshift range from the DESI Year 1 data. Through stacked spectral analysis and line-continuum luminosity correlations, we identify a clear evolutionary sequence in all AGN where broad H\b{eta} fades first, followed by Mg II, and then H{\alpha}, as the AGN luminosity declines - consistent with expectations from reverberation mapping. This trend reflects a radially stratified broad line region (BLR), where each line's responsivity depends on its ionization potential and radial distance from the central engine. In addition, we find that more massive supermassive black holes (SMBHs) require lower Eddington ratios to fully suppress broad emission lines, suggesting that the critical accretion threshold for the CL phenomenon is mass-dependent. Our results present the first statistical confirmation of a stratified broad line fading sequence in AGNs, reinforcing the central role of accretion state in shaping BLR structure and visibility.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an efficient estimator for higher-order galaxy clustering using small groups of nearby galaxies, or multiplets. Using the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2, we identify galaxy multiplets as discrete objects and measure their cross-correlations with the general galaxy field. Our results show that the multiplets exhibit stronger clustering bias as they trace more massive dark matter halos than individual galaxies. When comparing the observed clustering statistics with the mock catalogs generated from the N-body simulation AbacusSummit, we find that the mocks underpredict multiplet clustering despite reproducing the galaxy two-point auto-correlation reasonably well. This discrepancy indicates that the standard Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model is insufficient to describe the properties of galaxy multiplets, revealing the greater constraining power of this higher-order statistic on galaxy-halo connection and the possibility that multiplets are specific to additional assembly bias. We demonstrate that incorporating secondary biases into the HOD model improves agreement with the observed multiplet statistics, specifically by allowing galaxies to preferentially occupy halos in denser environments. Our results highlight the potential of utilizing multiplet clustering, beyond traditional two-point correlation measurements, to break degeneracies in models describing the galaxy-dark matter connection.

#### Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. V. Dramatic Variability in High-Ionization Broad Emission Lines

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic search for changing-look (CL) quasars at high redshift z > 0.9 by cross-matching the spectroscopic datasets from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 18. We identify 97 CL quasars showing significant variability in high-ionization broad emission lines, including 45 turn-on and 52 turn-off events, corresponding to a detection rate of approximately 0.042%. This rate is lower than that found for low-ionization CL quasars, likely due to both selection effects and physical differences in high-ionization lines. Based on the CL quasar sample, we find that CL quasars generally exhibit lower accretion rates compared to typical quasars, with average Eddington ratios of log lambda_Edd approximately -1.14 in the bright state and approximately -1.39 in the dim state, compared to approximately -0.65 for typical quasars. While high-ionization lines in CL quasars follow the Baldwin effect on a population level, some individual sources show inverse Baldwin trends. We also find a positive correlation between the variability of high-ionization lines such as Mg II and C III] and the change in bolometric luminosity. In addition, we estimate a characteristic rest-frame timescale of approximately 3 years for CL transitions, with no significant difference between turn-on and turn-off cases. Taken together, these results support an accretion-driven origin for the CL phenomenon and provide new insights into the variability of high-ionization emission lines.

#### Viscous Dark Energy and Mass-Varying Dark Matter in Lyra Manifold: Cosmological Dynamics and Observational Constraints

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15422

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the cosmological dynamics of a universe described by Lyra's geometry in the presence of dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM). Dark energy is modeled as a quintessence scalar field with bulk viscosity, while dark matter is allowed to interact with the scalar sector. The displacement vector field, arising naturally in Lyra's manifold, provides an additional geometric contribution. By employing dynamical system techniques, we analyze stability properties and late-time attractors. Our results indicate that viscosity and DE--DM interaction enrich the phase space structure and can help address both the cosmic acceleration and the coincidence problem. Furthermore, by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis with recent observational datasets, we derive best-fit values for the model parameters that exhibit good consistency with current data.

#### Challenging the $ω_0ω_a$CDM parametrization through rational expansions in view of DESI data release

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15472

 - **Abstract**
 In view of the new Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2025 results, we analyze three types of \emph{Padé cosmology}, based on rational series making use of Padé approximants over the equations of state, namely Padé$^{\omega}$ (0,1) and Padé$^{\omega}$ (1,1), plus a Padé$^{q}$ (0,1), i.e., a rational expansion on the dark energy deceleration parameter, in which where the numerator and denominator orders are incorporated into the above brackets. These scenarios appear alternative dark energy parameterizations with respect to the well-known $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model, claimed as the most viable model by DESI. Accordingly, we perform Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) analyses with the publicly available \texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code, including the three Padé cosmology, along with the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM standard pictures. To this end, we combine independent probes from high to low redshifts to obtain reliable constraints on the cosmological parameters of these models and compare them using statistical selection criteria. \emph{Our results show that Padé cosmology is neither statistically excluded nor worse than the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM parametrization}. On the contrary, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) identifies Padé$^{q}$ (0,1) as \emph{the best-fit model}, with weak evidence against the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM parameterization, while the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) provides \emph{strong evidence against the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model, favoring Padé (1,1)}. Based on our bounds, we further investigate the evolution of the squared sound speed, revealing that the Padé$^{q}$ (0,1) and Padé$^{\omega}$ (0,1) parameterizations exhibit enhanced stability compared with the other cases here considered and, therefore, describe robust alternatives for the cosmological background.

 - **Abstract**
 Ten short years ago, we had the rare privilege of witnessing the onset of a renaissance in science: humanity finally succeeded in its arduous quest to directly detect gravitational waves. This breakthrough did not occur in a vacuum: it was the natural culmination of decades of research dedicated towards understanding the nature of gravitation based on Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. It is a story of false starts, perseverance, and remarkable insights, propelled as much by technological progress as by human curiosity. We now proudly live in the new golden age of gravitational physics. The detection of gravitational wave signals from the merger of binary black holes and neutron stars are becoming routine. Coupled with our theoretical understanding of phenomena in the strong gravity regime, black hole physics has become a precision science. The purpose of these lecture notes is to help the reader understand the language and framework of this rapidly evolving subject, and to develop the ability to interpret, think, and discuss ideas that lie at the confluence of gravitational wave astronomy and black hole physics. It is our hope that these notes will prepare students and colleagues for the next revolution when gravitational wave events become commonplace and we begin to observe unexpected features in the signal, indicating either surprising astrophysical scenarios or a strong need to modify the theoretical description of gravitational interactions. We provide first principles analysis of black hole and gravitational wave physics, and sometimes a very personal interpretation of results. We share with the readers a number of notebooks that will allow them to reproduce some of the most important results in the field, and could even help in carrying out state-of-the-art research. We also include a few original results that we think are helpful in understanding the broader picture.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we consider generalized uncertainty principles (GUPs) that incorporate a minimal length through generic momentum-dependent deformation functions. We thus develop a systematic approach connecting such a framework to effective gravitational actions extending general relativity. By examining quantum gravity-motivated corrections to black hole entropy induced by the GUP and employing Wald's formalism, we reconstruct modifications to Einstein's gravity within the contexts of $f(R)$ and $f(R, R_{\mu\nu} R^{\mu\nu})$ theories. In this way, we establish a direct mapping between the GUP parameters and the higher-order curvature coefficients in the gravitational Lagrangian. As an illustrative application, we compute corrections to the general relativistic prediction for light deflection, which in turn allows us to infer a stringent upper bound on the minimal measurable length. Our results show that GUP-induced effects can be consistently embedded into extended gravity theories, offering a promising framework for testing quantum gravity phenomenology through astrophysical and cosmological observations.

#### Simulations of gravitational collapse in null coordinates IV: evolving through the event horizon, with an application to the spherical charged scalar field

 - **Abstract**
 We consider line elements of the form $-2G\,du\,(dx+B\,du) + R^2(...)$, where $(...)$ does not contain $dx$. Surfaces of constant $u$ are then null surfaces, and their affinely parameterised generators have tangent vector $G^{-1}\partial_x$. Considering $u$ as the time coordinate, we can evolve either $R$ or $G$, with the other one found by solving the Raychaudhuri equation along the null generators, or we can evolve both. This choice of formulation is independent from the remaining gauge choice $x\to x'(u,x,...)$ in the line element above, which is fixed incrementally by the choice of $B$. For example, we can evolve $G$, in order to be able to evolve through an event horizon, and use $B$ in to adapt the coordinates to type-II critical collapse. As a demonstration of these ideas, we consider a charged scalar field in spherical symmetry. We consider two settings: a domain where the outgoing null cones of constant $u$ emanate from a regular centre $R=0$, and a domain where the outgoing null cones emanating from an ingoing-null boundary. We demonstrate convergence with resolution, within each formulation and between the three formulations in both settings. As testbeds, we compute the critical exponents and periodic fine-structures of the black hole charge and mass scaling laws in a one-parameter family of charged regular initial data, and examples of perturbed extremal Reissner-Nordström solutions.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark energy perturbations are expected to modify the evolution of cosmological perturbations, producing observable effects on scalar perturbations and gravitational waves. We show that the effects of dark energy for a generic modified gravity model can be encoded in a momentum, space and polarization dependent effective matter-gravity coupling, in agreement with the results obtained in some specific theories, and that this is not just related to the effective Planck mass appearing in the action as a coefficient of the Ricci's scalar. Using appropriately defined effective energy tensors, we show that the method can be extended to include also the effects of higher order perturbations. The generality of this effective description of the effects of dark energy on cosmological perturbations gives a solid theoretical justification for the phenomenological approaches often used in the analysis of cosmological observations, allowing to understand the mapping between the results of phenomenological analysis of observational data and theoretical models. The momentum and polarization dependence of the effective gravitational coupling implies that the gravitational energy emitted by a binary coalescence can have an additional frequency and polarization dependence, due to the effects of dark energy perturbations.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the general construction of near-horizon limit for extremal black hole solutions with non-trivial torsion, and derive the covariant geometric conditions for the existence this limit. A near-horizon solution with torsion is constructed in the case of extremal Kerr-AdS black hole, starting from an ansatz compatible with near-horizon symmetry. We demonstrate that this solution corresponds to the limit of a new black hole solution with torsion.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the bound state solutions for the polar perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. It is shown that for a given value of the spherical harmonic index $\ell$, there are a total of $\ell-1$ bound states for polar perturbations. We show both analytically and numerically that the spectrum of $\ell-2$ of these perturbations agrees identically with the spectrum of axial perturbations. Correspondingly, the isospectrality between the bound states of the axial and polar perturbations in the interior of the black hole does hold. This is significant since the effective potential is singular at the center of the black hole, and the existence of the isospectrality is far from obvious. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the additional mode found in the spectrum of polar perturbations is the algebraically special mode, which is the ground state of polar perturbations as well.

 In this work, we study the gravitational waveforms from the periodic orbits of a massive particle around a dyonic ModMax black hole. We begin with a brief analysis of the spacetime and then examine how its parameters influence the dynamics of a massive neutral particle using the Lagrangian formalism. In particular, we compute the characteristics of marginally bound orbits and innermost stable circular orbits. Our results show that the values of these quantities increase with the black hole charge $Q$ and the screening parameter $\gamma$. We then plot various periodic orbits, characterized by the integers ($z$,$w$,$v$). Finally, we present the gravitational waveforms associated with extreme mass ratio inspirals, consisting of a stellar-mass compact object orbiting a supermassive black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field remains a demanding benchmark for numerical methods in numerical relativity, as it exhibits critical behavior at the boundary between dispersion and black hole formation. In this work we revisit this problem by relying on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as flexible partial differential equations solvers thereby providing a comparative assessment of several recent neural architectures. Building on the Einstein-massless-Klein-Gordon formulation in polar-areal coordinates, we consider four initial-value problems encompassing subcritical, critical, and supercritical regimes and use high-resolution finite-difference simulations as reference solutions. Our study is primarily comparative: we evaluate several state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including vanilla and high-precision PINNs, sinusoidal-feature and quadratic-residual variants, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, all trained under a common loss design that encodes the field equations, boundary conditions, and causal time-space enforcement, together with a novel adaptive spacetime sampling. Within this framework we also introduce ModPINN, a modest modification of standard PINNs that augments standard multiplayer perceptrons with coordinate embeddings, quadratic layers among other common ingredients in recent literature. This study shows that deep-learning-based methods can reproduce finite-difference solutions for the scalar field and the spacetime metric with competitive accuracy using significantly fewer collocation points than more traditional methodologies. While no single architecture dominates in all regimes, ModPINN achieves particularly stable and accurate solutions near criticality, indicating that suitable designed embeddings and adaptive sampling can enhance the robustness of PINNs for challenging gravitational-collapse scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Standard measures of quantum non-Markovianity are usually defined in terms of dynamical maps on a preferred time foliation and therefore do not extend straightforwardly to curved spacetimes, where no global time coordinate exists and causal structure is primary. We develop a covariant framework for open quantum dynamics along arbitrary timelike worldlines by building multi-time quantum processes (process tensors) from overlapping causal diamonds. For an Unruh--DeWitt detector weakly coupled to a scalar field in a Hadamard state, we define a foliation-independent measure of non-Markovianity as the operational distance between the physical process tensor and the convex set of Markovian (CP-divisible) processes. Numerical benchmarks in $(1{+}1)$ dimensions compare inertial motion, uniform acceleration, and static and infalling trajectories in Schwarzschild spacetime. Inertial trajectories are found to be almost Markovian, whereas acceleration and curvature generate pronounced long-range temporal correlations and strong non-Markovian behaviour. In Rindler spacetime, acceleration produces horizon-induced memory tails. In Schwarzschild spacetime, near-horizon field correlations cause both static and freely falling observers to experience enhanced memory, which can remain hidden in single-step diagnostics but becomes evident in multi-time protocols and can even be superactivated by combining different time steps. Our results provide, to our knowledge, the first coordinate-independent, operational quantification of quantum memory in relativistic settings. They identify spacetime curvature, horizons, and acceleration as controllable ingredients that can either degrade or be harnessed as resources in relativistic quantum information tasks, including communication and metrology with accelerated detectors and near black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 While Einstein was guided by the principle of general covariance in formulating general relativity, Kretschmann later argued that this principle lacks physical significance, since any space-time theory can be reformulated in a generally covariant form. This critique has prompted an ongoing debate over how to distinguish substantive general covariance from mere formal general covariance. Some proposals for defining substantive general covariance are based on the requirement that a theory be derivable from a diffeomorphism-invariant action. The present work aims to critically assess these proposals by examining canonical examples of Kretschmannian formulations of special relativistic theories. It will be shown that these formulations -- which seem merely formally generally covariant -- can always be derived from a diffeomorphism-invariant action. Although these actions involve auxiliary variables, these variables are trivial in the sense that they are either pure gauge or dynamically fixed by the other variables. Consequently, the theories described by these actions are arguably equivalent to the original Kretschmannian formulations. This stands in contrast to the actions proposed by Rosen and Sorkin, which include non-trivial auxiliary variables and hence seem to describe distinct physical theories. More recently, Freidel and Teh have suggested an additional criterion for substantial general covariance, namely that the action should also yield a non-trivial corner charge associated to diffeomorphism invariance. However, this too appears insufficient, since such actions can always be constructed.

 - **Abstract**
 The aim of this paper is to provide an analytical model for the formation of stable structures (cosmological or astrophysical), where stability is obtained through the tangential pressure countering the effect of gravity. We utilize the generalization of the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) spacetime to matter with tangential pressure generated by the angular momentum of fluid particles. Extending the Krasiński-Hellaby (KH) LTB reconstruction method, we show how set of three functions defined on two arbitrary hypersurfaces can fully determine the spacetime geometry. We further restrict our attention to the bounded case and develop the weak-field and the small-angular-momentum approximations. We show how these can be applied to the exact solution on the initial hypersurface, together with the oscillatory solution on the final hypersurface, to considerably simplify the reconstruction scheme. The so obtained models exhibit explicit dust-like behaviour in the early and middle stages of the collapse, and reach the final state as oscillations around the static solution.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models using the doubling method for orthogonal polynomial sequences. This approach yields the analytical spectrum and exact eigenstates of the models. We demonstrate that the standard SSH model is associated with the doubling of Chebyshev polynomials. Extending this technique to the doubling of other finite sequences enables the construction of Hamiltonians for inhomogeneous SSH models which are exactly solvable. We detail the specific cases associated with Krawtchouk and $q$-Racah polynomials. This work highlights the utility of polynomial-doubling techniques in obtaining exact solutions for physical models.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse a class of SYK models whose Hamiltonian is the sum of two SYK Hamiltonians with different numbers of fermions $q, \tilde q$ in each interaction. We consider both Euclidean and Lorentzian probes of the quantum system in the large $N$ limit. In the strong coupling phase, the entropy provides a diagnostic of the thermal renormalisation group flow. Under certain conditions, two parametrically separated regimes of near-conformal behaviour emerge. The first reproduces the standard linear-in-temperature scaling characteristic of the single SYK model. The system then flows to another near-fixed point whose entropy scaling depends on the ratio $n = q/\tilde q$. For $n<3/2$, the entropy exhibits anomalous, faster-than-linear scaling in temperature. At $n=3/2$, there is an additional logarithmic enhancement. Using conformal perturbation theory, we argue that in the infrared regime of the SYK model, there may exist disordered conformal operators with dimensions $1 < \Delta \leq 3/2$. In Lorentzian signature, we study the out-of-time-ordered correlator and show that these deformed theories exhibit near-maximal chaos in both regimes (when they exist). We comment on the relation between the anomalous scalings found here and those observed in certain near-extremal black holes in two and higher dimensions.

 - **Abstract**
 There are a number of classical double copies, each providing a prescription for generating solutions to the Maxwell and scalar wave equations from exact solutions of Einstein's equations. Two such prescriptions are the Kerr-Schild and twistorial double copies. We argue that for a broad class of self-dual vacuum solutions of the Kerr-Schild form, which we refer to as twistorial Kerr-Schild spacetimes, these two prescriptions are in fact equivalent. The approach is elementary, utilizing null Lorentz transformations, with homogenous functions on twistor space playing a central role. The equivalence is illustrated explicitly for the example of the self-dual (Kerr)-Taub-NUT spacetime. A detailed proof and several more examples will be presented in a long-form companion to this letter.

 - **Abstract**
 The Kerr/CFT correspondence establishes a relationship between extremal black holes in higher dimensions and a chiral conformal field theory (CFT) in their near-horizon limit. A generalization of this framework, known as the EVH/CFT correspondence, has been developed for four- and five-dimensional AdS black holes. It was further proposed in arXiv:1910.14293 that a generalized duality between $(D-2)$ dimensional geometry and $(D-3)$ dimensional field theory may emerge in AdS$_{D=6,7}$ black holes under a suitably defined extremal vanishing horizon (EVH) limit. In this work, we demonstrate that the near-EVH geometries arising in these AdS$_{6,7}$ black hole models are not of the standard lower dimensional AdS kinds of black holes to establish a lower dimensional version of AdS/CFT correspondence, but instead belong to the family of Einstein-Maxwell-Maxwell-dilaton (EMMD) gravity theories. This realization opens a pathway toward a microscopic counting of non-AdS black hole entropy via higher-dimensional AdS/CFT techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational path integral measure has been the subject of an increasing interest lately, and no conclusive answer yet exists for its correct form. In this paper, we adopt effective field theory techniques to shed light on this issue. We build the configuration-space metric as an energy expansion, including all possible terms that satisfy the underlying symmetries, and use it to define a Riemannian measure. We study the running of the free parameters that show up in this expansion at leading order, which corresponds to the DeWitt metric with parameter $\lambda$. We show that a flat configuration space is excluded on unitarity grounds. The renormalization group contains one UV fixed point at $\lambda=-1$, thus allowing for the UV completion of the measure sector. This fixed point corresponds to the value obtained by identifying DeWitt's metric from the kinetic term of general relativity, a standard procedure in the literature that otherwise lacks physical motivation. Our results provide such a justification from first principles.

#### Localizing AlAdS$_5$ black holes and the SUSY index on $S^1 \times M_3$

 We consider complex, supersymmetric, non-extremal Euclidean black holes that are asymptotically locally AdS$_5$, with $S^1 \times M_3$ conformal boundary. We study field theory backgrounds consisting of various $M_3$, and explicitly construct Killing spinors that are anti-periodic around the Euclidean time circle. Focussing on elliptically/biaxially squashed three-spheres and Lens spaces, we compute the supersymmetric index of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM in a Cardy-like limit. While such black holes have not been constructed for general $M_3$, we show that our field theory results can be recovered from a gravity computation using equivariant localization, just assuming the solutions exist.
