#### Ultramassive Black Holes and the Three $M$-$σ$ Relations

 - **Abstract**
 I consider recent observations of ultramassive black holes. These appear to confirm theoretical predictions that the relation between central black hole mass $M$ and spheroid velocity dispersion $\sigma$ has the same form $M \propto \sigma^4$ in spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies, and cluster ellipticals, but has differing normalizations. These arise from the need for longer black hole accretion episodes to expel the gas otherwise potentially able to feed the holes in the latter two types of host. In a sample drawn from a mixture of galaxy host types the fitted power of $\sigma$ will slightly exceed the theoretically-derived value of 4 because of the differing normalizations. The observed hole masses do not currently reach the theoretical maximum values possible for disc accretion, set by the equality of the ISCO and self-gravity radii, probably because the host galaxies have insufficient gas.

 - **Abstract**
 At low redshifts, hydroxyl megamasers (OHMs) have been shown to trace galaxy mergers, obscured starbursts, high molecular gas densities, and candidate dual supermassive black hole systems. Given this astrophysical utility, exploring these sources at larger cosmological look-back times is therefore of key interest. While previous OHM surveys have been limited to redshifts of $z \lesssim 0.25$, the ability to expand the OHM frontier is significantly enhanced with new high-sensitivity radio facilities such as MeerKAT. In this Letter, we report the discovery of an OHM in the gravitational lens system HATLAS J142935.3-002836 at $z = 1.027$, the most distant OHM source yet detected. The spectrum has blended 1667 and 1665 MHz emission and exhibits a highly complex profile, with spectral components ranging in widths of $<8$ km s$^{-1}$ to $\sim300$ km s$^{-1}$. The integrated (magnification uncorrected) luminosity of log($L_{\rm OH} / L_{\odot}$) = 5.51 $\pm$ 0.67 makes this the most apparently luminous OHM known to date. In the same wide-band dataset, we have also detected a previously unknown ${\rm H I}$ absorption line. The signal-to-noise ratio of over 150 with just a 4.7 h observation highlights the potential that MeerKAT and the future Square Kilometre Array mid-frequency array offer to explore the high-redshift OHM universe.

#### High Energy Emission from the Galactic Center

 - **Abstract**
 The center of the Galaxy is a prominent source in X-rays and gamma-rays. The study of its high-energy (HE) emission is crucial in understanding the physical phenomena taking place in this dense and extreme environment, where the closest supermassive black hole (SMBH) to us, Sgr A*, is lurking nearly invisible, today, in most of the energy spectrum. These phenomena are probably common to other galactic nuclei and may explain the feedback processes between nuclear regions and galaxies, so important for the overall evolution of the Universe. The Galactic center HE emission is very complex and consists of both thermal and non thermal radiation produced by compact and extended sources, surrounded by more diffuse components. All these objects and media are interacting with each other in the narrow and dense Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). Some of them also show relevant extensions towards the Galactic poles, indicating energetic outflows that seem to link the center to the recently observed large Galactic polar structures. In spite of the fundamental advances obtained in the last twenty five years with the most sensitive X-ray and gamma-ray observatories, several questions remain open to investigations. We review here the main observational results and the open issues on the high-energy diagnostics of the Galactic nuclear activity, focusing on processes that take place in the CMZ, and in particular discussing the role of the present and past SMBH activities in powering this region and possibly the whole Galaxy.

#### Tracing Fe K X-ray reverberation lag in the energy-resolved spectra of Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Ton S180

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.14197

 - **Abstract**
 We report the Fe K relativistic reverberation feature for the first time in the Narrow-line Seyfert\,1 galaxy Ton\,S180. Using a long observation from {\it XMM-Newton} we find that the Fe K emission lag peaks at $117\pm49$ s in the lag energy spectrum computed for frequencies $(0.3-8.5) \times 10^{-4}$ Hz. The lag amplitude drops to $22.85\pm14.20$ s as the frequency increases to $(8.5-30) \times 10^{-4}$ Hz. The time-averaged spectrum of the source shows a relatively narrow Fe K line at $\sim6.4$ keV, resulting in black hole spin to be low ($a=\rm 0.43_{-0.14}^{+0.10}$) found from the reflection modelling. We perform general relativistic transfer function modelling of the lag energy spectra individually. This provides an independent timing-based measure of the spin at $a=0.30_{-0.17}^{+0.34}$, and black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} = 0.29_{-0.16}^{+0.01}\times10^8M_{\odot}$, comparable to the previous measurement, and height of the corona $h = 2.59_{-0.33}^{+5.17}r_{\rm g}$. Further, we observe that the Fe K lag and the black hole mass fit well in the linear lag-mass relation shown by other Seyfert 1 galaxies.

#### PeV neutrons as origin of separated SS433 TeV signals

 - **Abstract**
 The SS433, a well-known binary system with an internal black hole, have shown since half a century, an inner (a few year light distances) twin precessing jets spirals. These beams are made by tidal forces while stripping mass from large stellar companion feeding an inner BH accretion disk and an orthogonal accelerating twin jet. From it, the radio, X gamma jet emission. A couple of years ago H.E.S.S telescope as well as HAWC and LHAASO array detectors, discovered also the surprising signature of an unexpected far twin separated gamma beam at tens TeV energy. At a hundred light years distances from its central source. We suggest that it is the legacy of a past rare eruption, a century ago, of tens PeV (10^16 eV) relativistic twin neutron beams. Their beta decay in flight at far distances, into proton, neutrino and in particular into tens TeV electrons, could feed the observed TeV gamma traces. They are originated by the same secondary tens TeV electrons emitting hard gamma, by Inverse Compton Scattering onto interstellar infrared photons.

#### Circular orbits and observational features of the rotating Simpson-Visser black hole surrounded by a thin accretion disk

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic investigation of the radiative properties and optical appearance of rotating SV black holes surrounded by a thin accretion disks, and mainly analyze the influence of the regularization parameter $g$ on related observables. The results show that although the kinetic quantities and the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) depend on the regularization parameter $g$, the radiative efficiency of the rotating SV black hole is the same as its Kerr counterpart. Within the Novikov-Thorne thin-disk model, the radiative flux, effective temperature, and spectral luminosity are studied, and by adopting observational parameters relevant to SgrA* and M87*, concrete examples of the rotating SV black holes are calculated and compared with that of the Kerr black holes. The results show that the parameter $g$ suppresses the maximum values of these quantities. In addition, using a backward ray-tracing technique, we numerically simulate the optical appearance of rotating SV black holes and analyze the corresponding intensity images, redshift and observed flux distributions. Our results show that these quantities are affected by $g$. In particular, as $g$ increases, the observed intensity is significantly suppressed and the photon ring region has remarkable increase in its width. Our findings suggest that accretion-disk-related observables may provide important avenues to distinguish rotating SV black holes and Kerr black holes, and offer theoretical guidance for future high-resolution observations.

#### Back to Normal Again: Possible Destinies of JWST overmassive SMBHs and "Little Red Dots" in the View of Shin-Uchuu Simulation

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled the discovery of hundreds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at redshifts $z\gtrsim 4-7$. A non-negligible fraction of these SMBHs are hosted in galaxies with BH-to-galaxy mass ratios ($M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$) being excessively larger than that for local SMBHs by $\sim 1-2$ dex. The origin of these ``overmassive'' BHs remains elusive, demanding either a heavy seed formation scenario or rapid growth of seed BHs. Their deviation from local scaling relations challenges our understanding of how SMBHs and their host galaxies coevolve across cosmic time. In this paper, we apply phenomenological modelings for BHs and galaxies to dark matter halo merger histories from N-body simulations to investigate the subsequent evolution of JWST-discovered ``overmassive'' SMBHs. We find that early evolution of ``overmassive'' SMBHs is dominated by stunted accretion leading to gradual decreases in $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios. In contrast, less massive SMBHs experience super-Eddington accretion during their early evolution, resulting in a slow increase of mass ratios toward $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star \sim 0.01$. Convergence occurs at $M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^8~M_\odot$ with $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star \sim 0.01$. At lower redshift, nearly all SMBHs evolve onto local relations, as expected given that our models adopt empirical relations derived from low-redshift observations. This suggests that the global feedback mechanisms regulating the coevolution of $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios are implicitly encoded in local relations in terms of star-formation rate distribution, black hole accretion rate distribution and their active (quiescent) fractions.

#### 4U 1556-60 as a very faint neutron star X-ray binary at 700 pc with an undetected radio jet

 - **Abstract**
 4U 1556-60 is a low-mass X-ray binary that was discovered more than 50 years ago as a persistent X-ray source; however, very little was known about it. Recently, Gaia obtained a parallax for the optical counterpart that places 4U 1556-60 at a distance of only about 700 pc, making it one of the closest X-ray binaries known to date. This close distance drastically alters what was previously assumed about the source. We revisit 4U 1556-60 in light of the newly determined distance of 700 pc, reinterpreting its literature and presenting new X-ray and radio observations to better understand various characteristics of the system. We conclude that a scenario in which 4U 1556-60 is a candidate ultracompact neutron star X-ray binary at a distance of ~700 pc is able to explain the observed properties of the source. It resides at a persistent X-ray luminosity of ~2x10^34 erg/s, an unusual value for a typical X-ray binary, but similar to several ultracompact systems. The ratio of the X-ray to optical luminosity is very high, also suggesting a physically small accretion disk. The radio jet is undetected with a very deep upper limit of 3x10^25 erg/s, which is about 10^3 times fainter than the expected black hole jet correlation, strongly indicating a neutron star accretor. The X-ray spectrum is dominated by a power law, and the X-ray timing properties are also consistent with observations of other very low accretion rate X-ray binaries. No spin or orbital periodicity are found in the X-ray data. Future observations, especially to determine its orbital period, will further aid in understanding 4U 1556-60.

#### A universal critical accretion rate for black hole jet formation

 - **Abstract**
 It has long been suspected that black hole accretion-outflow coupling is invariant from the stellar to supermassive scales. Stellar mass black hole accretion flows are known to launch jets and outflows as they transition through critical accretion rate thresholds, with values well constrained observationally owing to their short evolutionary timescales. In contrast, accretion flows in typical supermassive black hole (SMBH) systems (those in active galactic nuclei) evolve over thousands of years, making the critical transitions at which jets are launched impossible to constrain in individual systems. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide the unique opportunity to witness the birth and evolution of an accretion flow onto a SMBH which evolves on timescales of years. Here we show that TDEs launch outflows during a super-Eddington accretion phase and a second, physically distinct outflow, at a critical accretion rate of $L_{\rm crit} \approx0.02$ $L_{\rm Edd}$, the same as the critical accretion rate for state transitions observed in accreting stellar mass black holes. This work naturally explains the mechanism, observed properties, and detection rate for prompt and delayed outflows observed in TDEs, which until now have been open problems. More broadly, we demonstrate that SMBHs exhibit the same accretion-outflow coupling as stellar mass black holes and that the critical low accretion rate threshold for jet formation in black holes is scale invariant.

#### Prospects of Indirect Detection of Dark Matter via Primordial Black Hole Induced Gravitational Waves

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs), produced in the early Universe, can source a stochastic background of induced gravitational waves (GWs) and provide a non-thermal origin for dark matter (DM). We investigate DM production in a PBH-dominated cosmological framework, including contributions from PBH evaporation, gravitational production, and thermal freeze-in and freeze-out mechanisms, and determine the regions consistent with the observed DM relic abundance. We find that thermal freeze-in can compensate for the underabundance of PBH-sourced DM, while indirect detection remains largely insensitive due to the feeble interaction strength, making future GW observatories such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope (ET) unique probes of this scenario. For freeze-out DM, indirect detection experiments constrain regions with relatively large annihilation cross-sections, whereas GW observations probe complementary regions with heavier DM masses and smaller interaction strengths. Consequently, the same DM parameter space cannot be simultaneously probed by both indirect detection searches and GW missions. These results establish GW observations as a powerful and independent probe of DM production in PBH-dominated cosmologies, opening a new observational window into DM properties and the thermal history of the pre-BBN Universe.

#### Dynamical Formation of Self-Similar Wormholes

 - **Abstract**
 We study spherically symmetric, self-similar wormhole solutions supported by colliding streams of negative-energy null dust, and their dynamical formation. Under the assumption of self-similarity, the Einstein equations reduce to a system of ordinary differential equations, which we solve numerically under boundary conditions enforcing the existence of a minimal areal radius (the throat) on constant-time hypersurfaces. For a sufficiently large throat radius, the resulting geometries remain regular at both spatial and future null infinity, while a singularity is retained in the past direction. We then construct a dynamical formation scenario by patching together three regions: a Schwarzschild black hole, negative-energy Vaidya spacetimes, and the self-similar wormhole geometry. These regions are joined across null shells using the Barrabes--Israel formalism, which provides explicit relations among the throat radius, the black hole's mass and the energy injection by the shell, demonstrating that an initial black hole can evolve into a wormhole. Our analysis generalizes the formation model for static wormhole solutions proposed by Hayward and Koyama in 2004 to non-static wormhole solutions, offering a novel perspective on the formation of regular traversable wormholes.

#### Harmonic Analysis on Correlation for Gravitational-Wave Backgrounds of Arbitrary Polarization from Interfering Sources in Generic Dispersion Relation

 - **Abstract**
 The Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation serves as the fundamental benchmark for detecting the gravitational-wave background (GWB) in pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) within General Relativity (GR). However, this canonical signature relies on the idealization of a continuum of sources without interference. In realistic astrophysical scenarios dominated by supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), interference between discrete sources induces intrinsic deviations in the spatial correlation, which may mimic or obscure signatures of modified gravity. In this work, we derive the closed-form spatial correlation functions for a GWB with arbitrary polarization and generic GW dispersion relations, in the presence of source interference. Through a rigorous harmonic analysis, we demonstrate that source interference modifies the correlation shape but strictly preserves the lowest non-vanishing multipole moment characteristic of each polarization, specifically the quadrupole for tensor, dipole for vector, and monopole for scalar modes. The truncation at higher-order multipoles is governed by the interplay between pulsar distances and dispersion effects. Furthermore, we quantify the statistical degeneracy between interference-induced variation and modified gravity signatures. We conclude that access to only a single realization of the Universe imposes a fundamental theoretical limit on distinguishing modified gravity from GR using spatial correlations alone.

#### Spherically symmetric black holes in Gravity from Entropy and spontaneous emission

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.13694

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate static and dynamical spherically symmetric black hole solutions within the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) framework. We derive and solve the modified vacuum field equations for a static, spherically symmetric spacetime, revealing that the classical Schwarzschild geometry receives perturbative corrections scaling as $r^{-4}$. We establish that the GfE framework is consistent with current strong-field astrophysical observations. Higher-order geometric stresses inherent to the GfE vacuum drive a consistent mass-evolution profile. In the limit of large black hole mass, the theory predicts a constant background evaporation rate $ -\beta/24$, suggesting an inherent "entropic leakage" of the vacuum. At intermediate scales, the framework replicates the standard Hawking radiation mass-loss law as $\dot{M} \propto M^{-2}$ through a purely classical response of the modified background.

#### Reconstruction of Accelerating Nonlinear $f(T)$ Gravity Models via Hybrid Scale Factor: Cosmological Dynamics and Bayesian Evidence

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13744

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.13744

 - **Abstract**
 This study offers a comprehensive reconstruction of $f(T)$ gravity model with three distinct non-linear as well as novel forms employing a hybrid scale factor to depict the expansion history of the universe starting from early decelerated epoch to late-time accelerated evolution. Model parameters are rigorously constrained using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis with the help of Bayesian statistics and incorporating late-time observations from BAO and Patheon+SH0ES. The investigation of dynamical parameters such as the equation of state parameter and cosmological parameters indicates alignment with an accelerated expansion phase in both the present and late time epochs. Validation is conducted by assessing the energy conditions, verifying the feasibility of the model forms with particular emphasis on the violation of the strong energy condition that indicates dark energy dominance in modified gravity scenarios. This investigation has been instrumental in determining models that remain consistent with cosmological observations and theoretical requirements. The reconstructed forms of the model effectively mimic $\Lambda$CDM at late times, providing significant insights into possible extensions of general relativity and bolstering $f(T)$ gravity theory as a robust explanation for cosmic acceleration.

#### Bounding the graviton mass using non-linear density wave theory

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.13854

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we use the Newtonian gravitational potential corrected by non-liner effects to obtain new bounds on graviton mass using non-linear density wave theory (NLDW). This potential differs from the gravitational potential obtained in other modified gravity theories (e.g. the weak field limit of Yukawa gravity, Modified Newtonian Dynamics, non-local theories, $\Lambda$ cold dark matter..). Using this model, we are able to define wavelength of the non-linear wave as an analytical solution of integrable non-linear differential equation (namely, non-linear Schrodinger equation). Assuming that the wavelength of the non-linear wave represents the graviton Compton wavelength, we have found the corresponding upper bound of graviton mass. We compare obtained result with first assessments of LIGO $\&$ Virgo collaboration and we find they are in a good agreement. Present model used to determine the upper limit of graviton mass is completely independent from other methods published until now. We have compared our result with results obtained using several chosen published methods.

#### Hidden Conformal Symmetry and Emergent Holographic Structure in the AdS Teo Rotating Wormhole

 - **Abstract**
 We study scalar perturbations of the rotating Teo wormhole embedded in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime and demonstrate that the radial Klein Gordon equation exhibits an emergent conformal structure. The smooth traversable throat induces a logarithmic tortoise coordinate that allows the radial equation to be recast as the quadratic Casimir eigenvalue equation, paralleling the hidden conformal symmetry of the rotating Kerr black hole but arising here in a horizonless geometry. The AdS-Teo spacetime possesses two disconnected timelike AdS conformal boundaries that remain causally connected through the wormhole throat, in contrast to the two-sided eternal AdS black hole where horizons play a central role. Using the emergent conformal symmetry, we construct the near-throat generators, derive the effective potential, and obtain a discrete quasinormal-mode spectrum determined by regularity at the throat and standard AdS boundary conditions at infinity. The AdS embedding further enables a minimal holographic interpretation. As an explicit illustration, we compute an equal-time two-point function in the large-Delta (geodesic) limit from a regulated spacelike geodesic that traverses the wormhole, showing how the bulk geometry couples the two asymptotic boundaries. Together, these results provide a unified description of hidden conformal structure, spectral properties, and boundary correlators in a rotating, horizonless asymptotically AdS wormhole.

#### The Theoretical Landscape of Mimetic Gravity: A Comprehensive Review

 - **Abstract**
 Mimetic gravity has emerged as a compelling extension of General Relativity (GR), originally motivated by the attempt to isolate the conformal degree of freedom of the gravitational field. By reparametrizing the physical metric in terms of an auxiliary metric and a scalar field, the theory naturally gives rise to a longitudinal degree of freedom that mimics the behavior of cold dark matter. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the theoretical landscape of mimetic gravity and its multifaceted applications to cosmology and high-energy physics. We begin by examining the original formulation and addressing the fundamental question of its equivalence to GR, highlighting how a singular disformal transformation introduces new physical degrees of freedom. We then explore minimal generalizations that lead to unified cosmological models, including mimetic matter scenarios and extensions into $f(R, \phi)$ gravity, which allow for the reconstruction of any desired expansion history. Significant attention is given to the ``limiting curvature'' hypothesis through $f(\Box \phi)$ modifications, providing a classical mechanism for resolving cosmological and black hole singularities. We critically assess the challenges facing the theory, specifically the gradient and ghost instabilities identified in cosmological perturbations, and discuss modern resolutions such as ghost-free mimetic massive gravity and covariant formulations of Hořava gravity. Finally, we discuss the role of the mimetic field in the early universe, specifically in the context of asymptotically free gravity and the resolution of the self-reproduction problem in inflation.

#### Quantum Geometry Effects in Quantum Field Theory: Hamiltonian constraint Generates Gravity-Matter Entanglement

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we address a foundational challenge in quantum field theory on curved spacetime by developing a consistent framework within loop quantum gravity. We introduce a methodology for defining meaningful superpositions of quantum geometry and matter states. This is achieved by identifying a restricted subspace of the gravitational phase space, which ensures unitary equivalence among Fock representations of a scalar field across different quantum geometries. Within the resulting well-defined state space, we derive weak solutions to the quantum Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity. Furthermore, we generalize the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state to this quantum geometric framework. The resulting state exhibits the inherent entanglement between geometry and matter, which arises from the quantum Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity. This work establishes a principled framework for studying geometry-matter entanglement and offers new insights into the quantum foundations of the black hole information paradox.

 - **Abstract**
 Golden dark sirens - exceptionally well-localized gravitational-wave (GW) sources without electromagnetic counterparts - offer a powerful route to precision measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, with next-generation (XG) detectors. The statistical promise of this method, however, places stringent demands on waveform accuracy and detector calibration, as even small systematic errors can dominate over statistical uncertainties at high signal-to-noise ratios. We investigate the impact of waveform-modeling systematics on golden dark siren cosmology using a synthetic population of binary black holes consistent with current GW observations and analyzed in the XG-detector era. By comparing state-of-the-art waveform models against numerical-relativity-based reference signals, we quantify modeling inaccuracies from both modeling and data-analysis perspectives and assess how they propagate into biases in luminosity distance, host-galaxy association, and single-event $H_0$ inference. We find that while current waveform models often allow recovery of statistically consistent $H_0$ posteriors, small waveform-induced biases can significantly affect three-dimensional localization and host galaxy ranking, occasionally leading to incorrect redshift assignments. We further derive order-of-magnitude requirements on detector calibration accuracy needed to ensure that calibration systematics remain subdominant for golden dark sirens observed with XG networks. To realize sub-percent $H_0$ measurements with golden dark sirens will require waveform and calibration accuracies that scale as $\mathcal{O}(\rho^{-2})$ with signal-to-noise ratio, motivating sustained advances in waveform modeling, numerical relativity, and detector calibration for the XG era.

#### On a Gödel-like Solution in Non-Relativistic Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 The article deals with Gödel-like solutions in the context of Galilean gravity, a geometric formulation of non-relativistic gravitation defined on a five-dimensional Galilean manifold. Within this framework, non-relativistic matter fields admit a covariant description, while the physical Newtonian dynamics is recovered through an immersion into the usual $3+1$ spacetime. By adopting a Gödel-like metric ansatz and coupling the gravitational field to a Galilean fluid derived from a variational principle, we obtain a system of highly nonlinear and coupled field equations. Exact solutions are constructed by fixing the matter sector consistently with the field equations. The resulting configurations describe rotating non-relativistic universes and satisfy $D(x)>H(x)$ throughout the entire spatial domain. As a consequence, the associated Killing vector remains spacelike everywhere and no closed timelike curves arise.

 - **Abstract**
 Cold dark matter may be a fluid (or plasma) residing in a strongly-interacting hidden sector, rather than a population of weakly-coupled particles. Such a scenario admits a holographic description in terms of a cosmological braneworld embedded in the linear dilaton five-dimensional (5D) spacetime. In this framework, dark matter originates from the linear dilaton bulk black hole, whose phase we show to be thermodynamically favored at all temperatures. We present a natural freeze-in mechanism for the production of holographic dark matter, in which the bulk black hole is fed by energy leaking from the brane after inflation. Our model is characterized by two free parameters, one of which, the position of the black hole horizon, is fixed by the observed dark matter abundance. The remaining parameter, the 5D Planck scale $M_5$, is consistent with all current experimental bounds provided that $M_5\gtrsim 3\times 10^5$ TeV.

 - **Abstract**
 The counting of microstates of supersymmetric black holes with anti-de Sitter or flat asymptotics is obtained by computing a supersymmetric index in a weakly coupled string theory or a dual superconformal field theory. These indices are protected observables, whose value can be reliably extrapolated from weak to strong coupling, where the gravitational description applies. In this Thesis, after a broad introductory review, we discuss recent progress in formulating such protected observables directly within the gravitational theory, via the Euclidean path integral. In the semiclassical limit the index reduces to a sum over complex Euclidean saddles. These saddles are supersymmetric but ''non-extremal'', and arise in both anti-de Sitter and flat spaces. In the holographic setting, we investigate four-derivative corrections to the thermodynamics of AdS$_5$ black holes. Using off-shell methods, we construct the corrected action of five-dimensional gauged supergravity. We then evaluate the corrected on-shell action of supersymmetric AdS$_5$ black holes and find exact agreement with a Cardy-like limit of the superconformal index of the dual conformal field theory. By a Legendre transform of the action, we obtain the corrected black hole entropy, and we confirm this result by applying Wald's formula to the corrected near-horizon geometry. We then turn to the gravitational index with asymptotically flat boundary conditions. We uncover a broad family of novel saddles and present a general classification based on their rod structure, which characterizes their topology. These solutions may feature multiple horizons or three-dimensional bubbles with lens space topology, and allowing for conical singularities yields further geometries, involving spindles and branched spheres. For the simpler geometries, the on-shell action is computed using an odd-dimensional version of equivariant localization.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a fully discrete and non-perturbative formulation of two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity within the BF framework. Using group-valued holonomies and Lie-algebra--valued dilatons, the bulk theory is shown to be purely topological, with all physical information encoded at the boundary. We analyze admissible discrete boundary conditions and derive the corresponding asymptotic symmetry algebras directly at the lattice level, including an affine Kac-Moody symmetry and its Brown-Henneaux reduction to a Virasoro algebra, together with the associated Virasoro-dilaton structure. A precise operator product expansion (OPE) dictionary is established by taking the controlled continuum limit of the discrete Poisson brackets. Beyond asymptotic symmetries, we provide an effective boundary description and a representation-theoretic quantization organized by monodromy sectors. Within this discrete framework, black hole entropy follows from gauge-invariant holonomy data and is expressed in terms of the dilaton Casimir, reproducing the Bekenstein--Hawking result without invoking a fundamental Schwarzian action.

#### On the Unitarity of the Gravitational S-Matrix in High Dimension

 We argue that for finite energy windows, the final states in gravitational scattering in dimension $d > 4$ are normalizable coherent states in Fock space. However, as the center of the energy window goes to infinity, black hole physics predicts that these states become orthogonal to every state with a finite number of particles. Given that the spectral measure in energy is determined by Poincare invariance, the S-matrix cannot be a unitary operator in Fock space, despite having finite matrix elements in Fock space, and satisfying perturbative unitarity, to all orders in string perturbation theory. We identify regimes in the BFSS matrix model\cite{bfss} and the definition of the S-matrix as the limit of CFT correlators\cite{polchsuss}, which point to the same conclusion. We review a scattering theory based on the quantum mechanics of a finite number of fermionic oscillators, whose algebra formally converges to the Super-Poincare covariant Awada-Gibbons-Shaw\cite{ags} algebra, and argue that a certain class of limiting states on that algebra satisfy all the properties required by physical unitarity in the algebraic formulation of quantum mechanics. The only missing ingredient for a consistent theory is a proof that the S matrix amplitudes themselves are Poincare invariant. We provide suggestive arguments, but no real proof, that this is so.
