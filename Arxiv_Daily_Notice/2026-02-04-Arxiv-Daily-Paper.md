#### Radiation-hydrodynamics of star-disc collisions for quasi-periodic eruptions

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are recently discovered transients of unknown nature occurring near supermassive black holes, which feature bright X-ray bursts separated by hours to days. A promising model for QPEs is the star-disc collisions model, where a star repeatedly interacts with an accretion disc around a black hole, creating shocks that expel dense outflows of gas from which radiation emerges. We investigate the dynamics of the star-disc collisions, the properties of the outflows, and the resulting radiation signatures. Our study focuses on the generic case where the star remains unperturbed by the collision and the stellar crossing time through the disc is sufficiently long for shocked gas to flow around the star. We performed a three-dimensional (3D) radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of the star-disc collision. The star was modeled as a solid, spherical body, and the interaction was simulated for a small, local section of the accretion disc. We found that star-disc collisions generate a nearly paraboloidal bow shock. The heating of gas is not confined to the column of gas directly ahead of the star but also extends laterally as the shock front expands sideways while traveling with the star. As the star crosses the disc, it injects momentum preferentially along its direction of motion, leading to an asymmetric redistribution of energy and momentum. As a result, two outflows emerge on opposite sides of the disc with different properties: the forward outflow expands faster, contains more mass, carries more energy, and is about twice as luminous as the backward outflow. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry in outflow properties and luminosity arises naturally from the collision dynamics, offering a possible explanation for the alternating strong-weak flare patterns observed in several QPE sources.

 - **Abstract**
 We compile a sample of 83 Little Red Dots (LRDs) with JWST imaging and find that a substantial fraction ($\sim$43%, rising to $\gtrsim$85% for the most luminous LRDs) host one or more spatially offset, UV-bright companions at projected separations of $0.5\rm \, kpc \lesssim d\lesssim 5 \rm \,kpc$, with median of $\langle d \rangle = 1.0\,\mathrm{kpc}$. This fraction is even higher when smaller spatial scales are probed at high S/N ratio: we show that the two most strongly lensed LRDs known to date, A383-LRD and the newly discovered A68-LRD, both have UV-bright companions at separations of only $d\sim0.3$ kpc, below the resolution limit of most unlensed JWST samples. We explore whether these ubiquitous red/blue configurations may be physically linked to the formation of LRDs, in analogy with the "synchronized pair" scenario originally proposed for direct-collapse black hole formation. In this picture, ultraviolet radiation from the companions, which typically have modest stellar masses ($M_\ast \sim 10^{8-9}M_\odot$), suppresses molecular hydrogen cooling in nearby gas, allowing nearly isothermal collapse and the formation of extremely compact objects, such as massive black holes or quasi-stars. Using component-resolved photometry and SED modeling, we infer Lyman-Werner radiation fields of $J_{21,LW} \sim 10^{2.5}$-$10^{5}$ at the locations of the red components, comparable to those required in direct-collapse models, suggesting that the necessary photodissociation conditions are realized in many LRD systems. This framework provides a simple and self-consistent explanation for the extreme compactness and distinctive spectral properties of LRDs, and links long-standing theoretical models for early compact object formation directly to a population now observed with JWST in the early universe.

#### Search for Faint Lone Double-Peaked H$α$ Lines as IMBH Signatures in the MUSE Deep Field

 - **Abstract**
 Double-peaked H$\alpha$ emission profiles can serve as potential signatures of accreting intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), particularly those residing outside galactic nuclei. Such features are expected to arise from rotating disk-like structures around black holes and can be used to identify elusive IMBH candidates. \citet{Almeida2022ApJ...934..100S} reported a sample of such double-peaked H$\alpha$ sources in the MUSE-Wide survey, interpreting them as potential signatures of wandering IMBHs after systematically excluding alternative explanations. Their method relied on constructing H$\alpha$ maps around central galaxies and visually identifying compact emission clumps in the surrounding halo regions. In this work, we revisit the analysis using the deeper MUSE Extremely Deep Field (MXDF) data and an automated detection algorithm tailored to identify such features. However, we do not recover any candidate population in MXDF, resulting in a null detection. This outcome is nevertheless informative, as it (1) highlights the inherent challenges in detecting IMBHs, and (2) demonstrates the potential of automated approaches for future systematic searches, even though it did not yield a positive outcome in this case.

 - **Abstract**
 General Relativity (GR) faces challenges from cosmic acceleration and observational tensions, necessitating stringent tests at cosmological scales. In this work, we probe GR deviations via a $\mu$-$\Sigma$ modified gravity parameterization, integrating KiDS-Legacy weak lensing (1347 deg$^2$, $z\leq 2.0$), joint CMB data (Planck/ACT/SPT), DESI DR2 BAO, and DES-Dovekie supernovae. KiDS-Legacy significantly improves constraint precision: $\mu_0$ (matter clustering) by $\sim 43\%$ and $\Sigma_0$ (gravitational light deflection) by $\sim 60\%$ relative to CMB alone. In the $\Lambda$CDM background, $\mu_0 = 0.21\pm 0.21$ is consistent with GR, while $\Sigma_0 = 0.149\pm 0.051$ deviates from GR at the 3.0$\sigma$ level -- attributed to large-scale CMB lensing from ACT/SPT. This precise separation of GR-consistent matter clustering and deviant light deflection provides key observational clues for new physics or data systematics. Our work underscores the critical role of synergizing high-precision CMB and WL data in advancing GR tests.

 - **Abstract**
 In isolated binary evolution, binary black hole (BBH) mergers are generally formed through stable mass transfer (SMT) or common envelope evolution. In recent years, the SMT channel has received significant attention due to detailed binary models showing increased mass transfer stability compared to previous studies. In this work, we perform a full zero-age-main-sequence to compact object merger analysis using detailed binary models at eight metallicities between $10^{-4}Z_\odot$ and $2Z_\odot$ to self-consistently model the population properties of BBH mergers in the SMT channel, determined their progenitor initial conditional, and investigate the binary physics governing their formation and metallicity dependence. We use the population synthesis code POSYDON to determine the population of BBH mergers from SMT. Using its extended grids of MESA binary models, we determine the essential physics in the formation of BBH mergers. SMT produces BBH mergers predominantly from systems with $P_{ZAMS}\leq10$ days. In these systems, both the initial mass transfer between two stars and the subsequent interaction between the remaining star and the first-born BH take place while the respective donor star is on the main-sequence (Case A). We find a limited contribution from wider Case B/C systems. Without a natal kick, the SMT channel does not produce BBH mergers above $Z>0.2Z_\odot$ due to orbital widening from stellar wind mass loss. The primary BH mass distribution shows a strong dependence on metallicity, while the mass ratio prefers unity independent of metallicity due to mass ratio reversal. Additionally, the $\chi_{eff}$ distributions contain peaks at $\chi_{eff}=0$ and ~0.15 of which the former disappears at high metallicities. A mass-scaled natal kick leave this sub-population unchanged but introduce a low-mass, unequal mass ratio sub-population that merges due to their high eccentricity.

#### The Tarantula Massive Binary Monitoring VII. On the nature of the eccentric O+BH binary candidate VFTS 812

 - **Abstract**
 Massive O-type stars ($M\gtrsim15\,M_\odot$) with an X-ray quiet black hole (BH) companion represent a crucial stage in massive binary evolution leading to binary BH mergers. The population of such binaries remains elusive, with $\lesssim5$ candidate or confirmed systems. The Tarantula nebula harbors thousands of massive stars, 2-3 % of which are expected to have BH companions. It is therefore an ideal place to hunt for such systems. Here we analyse 30 epochs of VLT/FLAMES IFU high-resolution observations of the H$\delta$ region, as well as archival FLAMES spectroscopy, of VFTS 812, a 17-day single-lined spectroscopic binary with an O4V primary and a minimum secondary mass of $5.1\,M_\odot$. Following careful removal of the nebular contamination, spectral disentangling on the new data did not reveal any signature of the hidden companion. We derive $T_\mathrm{eff}=49^{+3}_{-4}$ kK, $\log L/L_\odot=5.7\pm0.1$ and $v_\mathrm{rot,max}{\rm \,sin\,}i=110^{+25}_{-35}$ km/s for the O4V component, yielding a (single star) evolutionary mass of $53^{+6}_{-5}$ $M_\odot$ and an age in the range of 0-1.6 Myr. Using injection tests of various luminous artificial companions in our data, we exhaustively rule out the presence of any luminous signature from a main sequence star more massive than $6\,M_\odot$. We discuss the possible nature of the companion, suggesting that the rejuvenated O star + BH companion is the most suitable scenario to consistently explain the location, (rejuvenated) young age, eccentricity and lack of companion signature. While this establishes VFTS 812 as a strong candidate O+BH system, follow-up observations are deemed necessary for robust confirmation and to search for accretion signatures on the O4V star.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) are thought to be a driving mechanism of large-scale winds driven by active galactic nuclei, which cause significant galactic feedback through quenching star formation and regulating supermassive black hole growth. We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium-Resolution Spectrometer observations of two nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), F11119+3257 and F05189-2524, with nuclear X-ray detected UFOs and kiloparsec-scale outflow. These galaxies show remarkably similar mid-infrared continuum and emission line features, notably including a high-velocity $v_{90}$ $\sim$ 4000 km s$^{-1}$ outflow detected in highly ionized neon emission lines, e.g., \nevi. In F05189-2524, we see a slightly slower biconical outflow extending up to $\sim2$ kpc in the same neon emission lines. Both sources show evidence of AGN-driven radiative feedback through a deficit of rotational molecular hydrogen lines in the nuclear region, $<$1 kpc from the central quasar, but no clear evidence of any molecular gas entrained in the quasar-driven outflow. Energetic analysis shows that the warm ionized gas in both of these sources contributes minimally ($\sim0.1-5\%$) to the momentum outflow rate of these sources and leaves the conclusions of previous literature unchanged: the energetics of these sources are broadly consistent with a momentum-conserving outflow.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we have studied the motion of a massless scalar photon in the renormalization group (RG) improved Schwarzschild black hole spacetime in the presence of perfectly fluid dark matter (PFDM). Considering the critical orbit conditions and the null geodesics condition in static spherically sym- In metric geometry, we have shown the variation of the radius of the photon sphere $r_{ph}$ with the PFDM parameter $\zeta$. Due to perturbations in black hole spacetime, gravitational waves are emitted in the form of quasi-normal radiations, which correspond to quasi-normal modes (QNMs). In this work, we have studied two types of perturbations in RG improved Schwarzschild spacetime: scalar field perturbations and electromagnetic (EM) field perturbations. For both cases, we have studied the effect of the PFDM parameter on the quasi-normal mode frequencies and the shadow of the black hole, which is related to the photon radius.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a charged Bardeen black hole (BH) surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) and coupled to a cloud of strings (CS). The metric function combines the magnetic monopole charge from nonlinear electrodynamics, the PFDM logarithmic correction, and the CS parameter that renders the spacetime asymptotically non-flat. We analyze the horizon structure, identifying parameter ranges yielding non-extremal BHs, extremal configurations, and naked singularities. The null geodesics, photon sphere radius, and shadow are computed, revealing that both CS and PFDM enlarge the shadow. For neutral particle dynamics, we derive the specific energy, angular momentum, and innermost stable circular orbit location. Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) are examined through the azimuthal, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies, where notably the azimuthal frequency is independent of the CS parameter. Scalar field perturbations governed by the Klein-Gordon equation yield an effective potential whose peak decreases with both parameters, yet the transmission and reflection probabilities respond oppositely to CS and PFDM variations. The greybody factor bounds are obtained using semi-analytical methods. Our results demonstrate that the distinct effects of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ on various observables could allow independent constraints on these parameters through shadow measurements, QPO timing, and gravitational wave ringdown observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Within the framework of scalar-tensor theories of gravity, certain models can evade classical black hole no-hair theorems. A well-known example is Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, where black holes carrying a scalar charge can exist. We find that, within this theory, binary black holes initially described by General Relativity can acquire scalar charges once they reach a critical orbital separation ("dynamical scalarization"). We develop a simple semi-analytic model, based on the adiabatic conservation of the total Wald entropy, to estimate the scalar charge evolution during the binary inspiral. We also run fully nonlinear numerical-relativity simulations for different configurations, finding consistent results. The gravitational-wave phase difference between Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet and General Relativity waveforms, which we use to assess detectability, is also computed. We find that dynamical scalarization might be observable in nearly equal-mass binary black hole mergers with third-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, in a narrow range of the dimensional coupling of the theory.

#### Black hole (BH) junction conditions. Exterior BH geometry with an interior cloud and a new fluid of strings with integrable singularities

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03050

 - **Abstract**
 Regular black holes are often used to address singularities, but they typically involve a potentially unstable de Sitter core and an internal horizon that breaks predictability. Integrable singularities (IS) have recently gained attention because they avoid both issues and exhibit finite tidal forces, allowing nondestructive radial infall. First, we present a new BH solution sourced by a string fluid (FS) that exhibits an IS. Motivated by the divergence of the conserved energy in the cloud of strings (CS) model, we introduce an energy density profile based on the screening of the CS energy density within an FS framework, yielding a finite conserved energy. On the other hand, it has been proposed \cite{Ovalle:2024wtv} that an interior region, rather than a pointlike mass, can generate a Schwarzschild BH exterior region. Secondly, motivated by the variety of BH solutions with singularities in the literature, we establish the conditions that an interior region with an IS must satisfy to represent a generic exterior BH solution, with Schwarzschild being only a particular case of the latter. We derive the junction conditions (JC) between the interior and exterior regions, showing that they lead to temperature continuity at the interface, while discontinuities in tangential pressure lead to phase transitions. We propose that the nature of the interior region is described by CS and FS, while the exterior corresponds to Reissner Nordström.

#### Magnetic field effects on spherical orbit in Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson spacetime: constraints from jet precession of M87*

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.03161

 - **Abstract**
 The recently reported precession period of about $11.24$ years of the M87* jet provides a sensitive probe of strong field gravity and the electromagnetic environment in the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes. In this work, we study the precession of the spherical orbit in the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson geometry describing a rotating black hole immersed in a uniform electromagnetic field. Although the timelike geodesics is non-separable, we develop a Hamiltonian approach to investigate the spherical orbits. For sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the study shows that the spherical orbits can only exist within a finite radial range for given orbital inclination. Requiring the existence of the spherical orbits, we obtain an upper bound of the magnetic field, i.e., $B<0.33 M^{-1}$ for prograde and $B<0.0165 M^{-1}$ for retrograde motion. Furthermore, imposing the observed jet precession period, we obtain a significantly tighter constraint, $B\lesssim 0.0145 M^{-1}$, providing a new constrain on the magnetic field of M87* independent of the shadow. Our results provide unified constraints on the parameters of the KBR black hole and demonstrate that the jet precession offers a robust and complementary probe of magnetized black holes in the strong gravity regime.

 - **Abstract**
 The proper-time method for constructing perturbative dynamical gravitational fields is presented. Using the proper-time method, a perturbative analytical model of gravitational waves against the backdrop of an exact wave solution of Einstein's equations in a Bianchi IV universe is constructed. To construct the perturbative analytical wave model a privileged wave coordinate system and a synchronous time function associated with the proper time of an observer freely moving in a gravitational wave were used. Reduction of the field equations, taking into account compatibility conditions, reduces the mathematical model of gravitational waves to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for functions of the wave variable. Analytical solutions for the components of the gravitational-wave metric have been found. The stability of the resulting perturbative solutions is proven. The stability of the exact solution for a gravitational wave in the anisotropic Bianchi IV universe is demonstrated.

#### Novel exact black hole solution in Dehnen $\left(1,4,\frac32\right)$ halo thermodynamics, photon circular motion and eikonal quasinormal modes

 - **Abstract**
 Dehnen $(1,4,\frac32)$ dark matter halo has been proven to be a valuable model for describing the surface brightness distributions of elliptical galaxies, yet its implications for black hole spacetimes remain largely unexplored. In this work, we construct a novel exact black hole solution embedded in this Dehnen halo and investigate its physical consequences. The influence of the halo on black hole thermodynamics is analyzed through the mass function, entropy, Hawking temperature, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy, allowing us to assess both local and global thermodynamic stability of the black hole-dark matter system. Our results show that the presence of a Dehnen-type halo not only stabilizes the otherwise thermodynamically unstable Schwarzschild black hole but also induces phase transitions. In addition, we study null geodesics to examine photon motion, the shadow radius and the optical appearance of the system. The dark matter halo modifies the effective potential, leading to observable changes in the photon sphere and the apparent size of the shadow. We also explore the instability of circular null geodesics and its relation to quasinormal modes in an eikonal limit. These findings highlight the significant role of realistic dark matter distributions in shaping both the thermodynamic behavior and the observable signatures of black holes, providing further insight into the interplay between dark matter halos and central black holes in galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 This report reviews key developments in Carrollian physics with an emphasis on their role in the emerging framework of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes. We begin by introducing the Carrollian limit, understood as the non-relativistic contraction of the Poincaré group obtained by formally taking the speed of light to zero. The geometric structures associated with this limit are described and argued to arise naturally on null hypersurfaces, most notably on null infinity, as well as black hole and cosmological horizons. Building on this, we examine the relation between the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs symmetries governing asymptotically flat gravity and the conformal Carrollian symmetries. Explicit examples of Carrollian field theories are constructed by implementing the limit on well-known relativistic field theories, with particular attention to Carrollian CFTs. We then present the Carrollian holography proposal, according to which gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes is dual to a Carrollian CFT living at null infinity in one lower dimension. In this framework, the massless $\mathcal{S}$-matrix written in position space at null infinity is naturally reinterpreted in terms of boundary Carrollian CFT correlators, called Carrollian amplitudes. We highlight their relation to celestial amplitudes and show how they naturally emerge from holographic CFT correlators through a correspondence between the flat space limit in the bulk and the Carrollian limit at the boundary. Using this correspondence, we provide strong evidence that flat space holography arises from a controlled and consistent limiting procedure applied to both sides of the AdS/CFT duality. We conclude by outlining future directions and open questions in the program.

 - **Abstract**
 A central problem in formulating a theory of quantum gravity is to determine the size and structure of the Hilbert space of black holes. Here we use a quantum dynamical Krylov complexity approach to calculate the Hilbert space dimension of a black hole in 2+1-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space. We achieve this by obtaining the spread of an initial thermofield double state over the Krylov basis. The associated Lanczos coefficients match those for chaotic motion on the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ group. By including non-perturbative effects in the path integral, which computes coarse-grained ensemble averages, we find that the complexity saturates at late times. The saturation value is given by the exponential of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Our results introduce a new way to compute the Hilbert space dimension of complex interacting systems from the saturating value of spread complexity.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the area operator of a quantum extremal surface can be reconstructed directly from boundary dynamics without reference to bulk geometry. Our approach combines the operator-algebra quantum error-correction (OAQEC) structure of AdS/CFT with modular Krylov complexity. Using Lanczos coefficients of boundary modular dynamics, we extract the spectrum of the modular Hamiltonian restricted to the algebra of the entanglement wedge and isolate its central contribution, which is identified with the area operator. The construction is purely boundary-based and applies to superpositions of semiclassical geometries as well. As an application, we diagnose island formation and the Page transition in evaporating black holes using boundary modular evolution alone, bypassing any bulk extremization. More broadly, our results establish modular Krylov complexity as a concrete and computable probe of emergent spacetime geometry, providing a new route to accessing black hole interiors from boundary quantum dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the Page curve and information paradox for Kerr AdS black hole in light of entanglement entropy by employing the recently proposed island paradigm. By incorporating the island rule, we show that the entanglement entropy of Kerr AdS black hole grows linearly at early times and declines to a constant value at late times in agreement with the well established Page curve. The novelty of this study resides in the investigation of influence of phase transitions on the page curve in two different ensembles. We find that a first order phase transition results in a sharp discontinuity in the Page curve. We study the evaporation process in different scenarios and find that in all the situations, the Page curve doesn't violate the unitary principle of quantum mechanics.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we extend recent ideas about observers and closed universes to theories where observers can be fluctuated into existence in the Hartle-Hawking state. This introduces a phenomenon that was not considered in these earlier discussions: the dominant transition from one cosmological state to another can go through a fluctuation that annihilates the universe and creates a new one. We nonetheless argue that the observer decoherence rule allows for the third-quantized description of such a theory to emerge from a factorizing holographic theory with a one-dimensional Hilbert space, without any need for $\alpha$-parameters. We also point out a close analogy between the observer rule in this context and the coarse-graining of the spectral form factor at late times for AdS black holes. Along the way we clarify several aspects of the relationship between holography, the gravitational path integral, and $\alpha$-parameters. We also explain why string theory scattering amplitudes do not lead to a one-dimensional Hilbert space on the worldsheet, despite being computed by a gravitational path integral with a sum over topology. Finally we point out that using the path integral to compute integrated local operators conditioned on an observer in the context of a theory with a landscape can lead to rather surprising conclusions. For example we argue that in a landscape with one AdS minimum and one dS minimum, both of which can support observers, an observer almost surely finds themself in dS and not AdS even if the boundary conditions are dual to a state with an observer in AdS.
