 - **Abstract**
 On August 18th, 2025, the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA collaboration reported a sub-threshold gravitational wave candidate detection consistent with a sub-solar-mass neutron star merger, denoted S250818k. An optical transient, AT2025ulz, was discovered within the localization region. AT2025ulz initially appeared to meet the expected behavior of kilonova (KN) emission, the telltale signature of a binary neutron star merger. The transient subsequently rebrightened after $\sim$\,$5$ days and developed spectral features characteristic of a Type IIb supernova. In this work, we analyze the observations of the host galaxy of AT2025ulz obtained by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). From the DESI spectrum, we obtain a secure redshift of $z = 0.084840 \pm 0.000006$, which places the transient within $2\sigma$ of the gravitational wave distance and results in an integral overlap between the gravitational wave alert and the transient location of $\log_{10}\mathcal{I} \approx 3.9-4.2$. Our analysis of the host galaxy's spectral energy distribution reveals a star-forming, dusty galaxy with stellar mass ${\sim} 10^{10}~M_\odot$, broadly consistent with the population of both short gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernova host galaxies. We also present our follow-up of DESI-selected candidate host galaxies using the Fraunhofer Telescope at the Wendelstein Observatory, and show the promise of DESI for associating or rejecting candidate electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave alerts. These results emphasize the value of DESI's extensive spectroscopic dataset in rapidly characterizing host galaxies, enabling spectroscopic host subtraction, and guiding targeted follow-up.

 - **Abstract**
 We present hydrodynamic simulations with the moving-mesh code AREPO of Tidal Disruption Encores (TDEEs) in nuclear star clusters (NSCs). TDEEs arise when a stellar-mass black hole (sBH) disrupts a star within the NSC, producing debris that is unbound from the sBH but remains gravitationally bound to the central massive black hole (MBH), leading to a delayed secondary flare. We find that the morphology and thermodynamics of the fallback material depend sensitively on the disruption geometry, MBH mass, and sBH-MBH separation. We identify two distinct morphological outcomes: ring encores, where debris circularize into a torus, and direct encores, where streams plunge toward the MBH, with encore luminosities peaking at times corresponding to the freefall timescale and one orbital period, respectively. Across all simulated cases, we find these events exhibit luminosities of $10^{40}-10^{42}$ erg/s with lightcurves characteristic of their morphology. Our work greatly improves the predictions of TDEE lightcurves and empowers observations to probe into NSC dynamics and sBH population while providing possible explanations for anomalous TDE-like flares.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic comparison of three independent machine learning (ML)-based searches for strong gravitational lenses applied to the Dark Energy Survey (Jacobs et al. 2019a,b; Rojas et al. 2022; Gonzalez et al. 2025). Each search employs a distinct ML architecture and training strategy, allowing us to evaluate their relative performance, completeness, and complementarity. Using a visually inspected sample of 1651 systems previously reported as lens candidates, we assess how each model scores these systems and quantify their agreement with expert classifications. The three models show progressive improvement in performance, with F1-scores of 0.31, 0.35, and 0.54 for Jacobs, Rojas, and Gonzalez, respectively. Their completeness for moderate- to high-confidence lens candidates follows a similar trend (31%, 52%, and 70%). When combined, the models recover 82% of all such systems, highlighting their strong complementarity. Additionally, we explore ensemble strategies: average, median, linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and an Independent Bayesian method. We find that all but averaging achieve higher maximum F1 scores than the best individual model, with some ensemble methods improving precision by up to a factor of six. These results demonstrate that combining multiple, diverse ML classifiers can substantially improve the completeness of lens samples while drastically reducing false positives, offering practical guidance for optimizing future ML-based strong lens searches in wide-field surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 This review is focused on recent {\sl Self-Organized Criticality (SOC)} literature of astrophysical phenomena, covering the last decade of (2015-2025), while previous SOC literature (1987-2014) is reviewed elsewhere. The selection of literature is mostly based on searches with the NASA-supported {\sl Astrophysics Data System (ADS)}. The discussed astrophysical SOC phenomena are subdivided into solar flares, solar atmosphere (photosphere, chromosphere, corona), heliospheric systems (coronal mass ejections, solar wind, solar energetic particles), planetary systems (asteroids and small bodies, lunar cratering, Saturnian ring systems, magnetospheric systems), stellar flares, and galactic systems (pulsar glitches, gamma ray bursts, soft gamma-ray repeaters, supergiant fast X-ray transients, fast transient radio bursts, magnetars, blazars, black holes).

#### Cosmological Evolution of Gamma Ray Bursts

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are classified as long (LGRBs) and short (SGRBs) with collapsars and compact object mergers (neutron star (NS)-NS or NS-Black hole) as progenitors, respectively. The former are expected to follow the cosmic star formation rate (SFR), while the latter follows a delayed version of the SFR. However, this division has come under question in several ways, the most prominent being the observational evidence of a significant excess of LGRBs at low redhifts by several independent investigations, summarized in arXiv:2305.15081. This could indicate that the progenitors of low-redshift LGRBs, whose formation rates are delayed, (similar to that of SGRBs) are compact mergers rather than collapsars. Two recent observations of low-redshift LGRBs show associations with kilonovae, a clear feature of compact mergers. Most results showing this separation are based on analyses of small (less than 200) samples of LGRBs with measured redshifts. The aim of this paper is to use a larger sample of LGRBs. The number of LGRBs with measured redshifts has increased by more than a factor of 2 over the last decade. To this data set we add a sample of LGRBs whose redshifts are estimated using a machine learning (ML) method (arXiv:2410.13985). This, in addition to increasing the sample size, reduces the observational selection bias arising from the process of redshift measurement. To account for this bias, we use the non-parametric, non-binning Efron-Petrosian method to establish the degree of correlation between luminosity and redshift, the luminosity evolution, which then allows us to use the Lynden-Bell $C^-$ method to obtain a complete description of the luminosity function. We find similar low redshift excess for the larger sample with measured redshifts. Adding the sources with ML-estimated redshifts, which tend to have more sources in mid-range redshifts, the excess is reduced.

#### Rest-frame Optical Spectroscopy of $z \sim 2$ Quasars with Steep Hard X-ray Spectral Shapes: X-ray Selection of Super-Eddington Accretion and Verification

 - **Abstract**
 Super-Eddington accretion is a crucial phase in the growth of supermassive black holes. However, identifying super-Eddington accreting quasars observationally is challenging due to uncertain black-hole mass estimates and other complications. The Eddington ratio parameter does not represent accurately the accretion rate in the super-Eddington regime. On the other hand, super-Eddington accreting quasars appear to show large hard X-ray (rest-frame > 2 keV) power-law photon indices, and they also exhibit distinct optical spectral features including weak [O III] $\lambda 5007$ emission and strong Fe II emission. We test steep X-ray photon-index selection of super-Eddington accreting quasars by obtaining Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope near-infrared spectra for a pilot sample of nine $\Gamma=2.0-2.6$ quasars at $z\approx1.4-2.5$. We derive H$\beta$-based single-epoch virial black-hole masses (median value $\rm 4.3 \times 10^{8}~M_{\odot}$) and Eddington ratios (median value 0.6). The Eddington ratio distribution is consistent with that of the comparison sample, which is a flux-limited sample of quasars at $z\approx1.5-3.5$ with near-infrared spectroscopy. But our super-Eddington candidates do show statistically weaker [O III] emission ($P_{\rm null}=0.0075$) and marginally stronger Fe II emission ($P_{\rm null}=0.06$). We also find one candidate with broad (width of 1960 km/s) and blueshifted (690 km/s) [O III] $\lambda 4959$ and [O III] $\lambda 5007$ lines, which probably originate from a strong [O III] outflow driven by super-Eddington accretion. Overall, the steep X-ray photon-index selection of super-Eddington accreting quasars appears promising. But a larger sample is needed to assess further the reliability of the selection.

 - **Abstract**
 A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star passes within the tidal radius of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). In TDEs it is expected that the orbital angular momentum of the disrupted star is generally misaligned with the SMBH spin axis, which should result in a misaligned super-Eddington disk precessing around the SMBH spin axis due to the Lense-Thirring effect. In this paper, we investigate the distinct observational signatures produced from such TDE disks, by performing radiative transfer calculations upon previous super-Eddington disk simulations. We demonstrate that the precession of the disk and wind drive time-dependent obscuration and reprocessing of X-ray radiation. Depending on the orientation of the viewing angle of the observer and the tilt angle of the disk, four main types of variability are induced: 1) The smooth-TDEs: The emissions from these TDEs show no fluctuations; 2) The dimmer: The main emission type (X-ray or optical) stays the same, with small to moderate modulations of brightness; 3) The blinker: X-ray and optical emissions take turns to dominate in one cycle of precession, with dramatic changes in the X-ray fluxes. 4) The siren: X-ray and optical emissions take over each other twice per cycle, possibly with two different peak X-ray fluxes within one cycle. In all three scenarios, we observe an inverse correlation between X-ray and optical emissions. Our model provides a unified physical framework for interpreting TDE multi-wavelength variability through disk precession dynamics and gives an alternative interpretation to the interesting case of J045650.3-203750 which was suggested to be a repeated partial TDE previously.

#### No Evidence for a Dynamically Evolving Dark Energy Scenario: Tomographic Alcock-Paczyński Test with Redshift-Space Correlation Function II

 - **Abstract**
 We apply an extended Alcock-Paczyński (AP) test to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data to constrain the dark energy models with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of the dark energy equation of state. The extended AP test method uses the full shape of redshift-space two-point correlation funcion(CF) as the standard shape in order to measure the expansion history of the universe. We calibrate the standard shape by using the cosmology-dependent nonlinear evolution of the CF shape in the Multiverse simulations. Further validation of the method and calibration of possible systematics are performed based on mock samples from the Horizon Run 4 simulation. Using the AP test alone, we constrain the flat CDM plus CPL-type dark energy model (flat $w^{\rm CPL}$CDM) to have $\Omega_m=0.289_{-0.029}^{+0.031}$, $w_0=-0.798_{-0.102}^{+0.192}$ and $w_a=-0.165_{-0.945}^{+0.610}$. The result does not show evidence for a dynamically evolving dark energy model. When combined with other results from the low-redshift universe, such as the PantheonPlus supernova compilation and DESI BAO data, the constraint on $w_a$ becomes $w_a=-0.124_{-0.368}^{+0.334}$, which is still consistent with zero.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are essential tools for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. While they reproduce many key observed properties of galaxies, their limited volumes have hindered comprehensive studies of the AGN and quasar populations. In this work, we leverage the FLAMINGO simulation suite, focusing on its large $(2.8$ $\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ volume, to investigate two key observables of quasar activity: the quasar luminosity function (QLF) and quasar clustering. FLAMINGO reproduces the observed QLF at low redshift ($z \lesssim 1$) and for faint quasars ($L_\mathrm{bol} \lesssim 10^{45}$ $\mathrm{erg s^{-1}}$), but significantly underpredicts the abundance of bright quasars at $z \approx 1$-$3$. Introducing a 0.75 dex log-normal luminosity scatter to represent unresolved small-scale variability boosts the number of bright quasars by upscattering lower-luminosity systems, thereby improving agreement with observations at the bright end. A decomposition of the QLF by black hole mass reveals that this boost is primarily driven by low-mass black holes radiating above the Eddington limit. Nevertheless, limitations remain in fully reproducing the rise and decline of the bright quasar population over cosmic time and in matching the black hole masses inferred from quasar spectra. Thanks to FLAMINGO's large volume, we can robustly sample rare, luminous quasars and measure their spatial clustering for $\log_{10} L_\mathrm{bol}/\mathrm{erg s^{-1}} \gtrsim 45.5$. The simulation reproduces the observed clustering across $0 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$, and the reduced luminosity dependence introduced by scatter aligns with observational trends. However, it underpredicts the clustering strength at $z \approx 4$, consistent with other models and possibly reflecting high-redshift observational uncertainties.

 - **Abstract**
 The South Pole Telescope (SPT), using its third-generation camera, SPT-3G, is conducting observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in temperature and polarization across approximately 10 000 deg$^2$ of the sky at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. This comprehensive dataset should yield stringent constraints on cosmological parameters. In this work, we explore its potential to address the Hubble tension by forecasting constraints from temperature, polarization, and CMB lensing on Early Dark Energy (EDE) and the variation in electron mass in spatially flat and curved universes. For this purpose, we investigate first whether analyzing the distinct SPT-3G observation fields independently, as opposed to as a single, unified region, results in a loss of information relevant to cosmological parameter estimation. We develop a realistic temperature and polarization likelihood pipeline capable of analyzing these fields in these two ways, and subsequently forecast constraints on cosmological parameters. Our findings indicate that any loss of constraining power from analyzing the fields separately is primarily concentrated at low multipoles ($\ell$ < 50) and the overall impact on the relative uncertainty on standard $\Lambda$CDM parameters is minimal (< 3%). Our forecasts suggest that SPT-3G data should improve by more than a factor of 200 and 3000 the Figure of Merit (FoM) of the EDE and the varying electron mass models, respectively, when combined with Planck data. The likelihood pipeline developed and used in this work is made publicly available online.

#### How Flat is a Plateau? Evolution of Late-Time TDE Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Late-time light curve plateaus in tidal disruption events (TDEs) are often approximated as flat and time-independent. This simplification is motivated by theoretical modeling of spreading late time TDE disks, which often predicts slow light curve evolution. However, if time evolution can be detected, late-time light curves will yield more information than has been previously accessible. In this work, we re-examine late-time TDE data to test how well the flat plateau assumption holds. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate the maximum likelihood for a family of theory-agnostic models and apply the Akaike information criterion to find that that roughly one third of our sample favors evolving plateaus, one third favors truly flat plateaus, and one third shows no statistically significant evidence for any plateau. Next, we refit the TDEs that exhibit statistically significant plateaus using a magnetically elevated $\alpha$-disk model, motivated by the lack of clear thermal instability in late time TDE light curves. From these model-dependent fits, we obtain estimates for the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, the mass of the disrupted star, and the $\alpha$ parameter itself. Fitted $\alpha$ values range from $10^{-3}$ to 0.4 (the mean fitted $\alpha=10^{-1.8}$, with scatter of 0.6 dex), broadly consistent with results from magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Finally, we estimate the timescales of disk precession in magnetically elevated TDE models. Theoretically, we find that disk precession times may be orders of magnitude shorter than in unmagnetized Shakura-Sunyaev disks, and grow in time as $T_{\rm prec}\propto t^{35/36}$; empirically, by using fitted $\alpha$ parameters, we estimate that late time disks may experience $\sim$few-10 precession cycles.

 - **Abstract**
 The Kalb-Ramond field is a background tensor field that arises in string theory and violates local Lorentz symmetry of spacetime, upon acquiring the Vacuum Expectation Value. A non-minimal coupling between the Kalb-Ramond VEV and the Ricci tensor may give rise to a modified black hole solution. Considering two copies of such black holes, we construct a thin-shell wormhole using the Cut-and-Paste technique. Then we investigate key physical properties of the wormhole like pressure-density profile, equation of state, the geodesic motion of test particles near the wormhole throat, and the total amount of exotic matter in the throat, and examine how these properties vary with the Lorentz-Violating parameters. We find that the wormhole model violates the null and weak energy conditions, but satisfies the strong energy condition. On top of that, the velocity of the throat radius is found considering its time evolution. Finally, we analyze its linear stability against small radial perturbations.

 - **Abstract**
 The search for regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields has sprouted numerous candidates, each exhibiting certain virtues but often accompanied by significant drawbacks. We demonstrate that Komar mass, electric charge and magnetic charge are mutually dependent in regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields, defined by Lagrangian which is a function of both electromagnetic invariants, $F_{ab} F^{ab}$ and $F_{ab}{\star F}^{ab}$, regardless of the specific weak field limit of the theory. Also, we generalize one of the key no-go theorems by showing that static, spherically symmetric, electrically charged black holes in a theory respecting the relaxed Maxwellian weak field limit do not admit a bounded Kretschmann scalar. Finally, we address one of the long-standing niche questions, whether regular black hole solutions can exist when both electric and magnetic charges are present, by constructing an exotic family of regular dyonic black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields in theories respecting the Maxwellian weak field limit. Mounting evidence suggests that regularizing black holes through simplistic nonlinear extensions of Maxwell's electromagnetism entails a high cost in the form of unorthodox theoretical assumptions.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of black hole shadows is one of the most interesting effects of the strong field regime of general relativity (GR). Recent observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have provided high-resolution images of the vicinity of supermassive black holes, ushering in a new era for testing gravitation on astrophysical scales. In this work, we continue the investigation initiated by \cite{furtado2025gravitational}, focusing on shadows associated with generalized $k-n$ \emph{black-bounce} type spacetimes, which smoothly interpolate between regular black holes and wormholes. We consider a generalization of the metric with free parameters $(a,k,n)$ that modify the mass function and enrich the possible phenomenology. We develop a semi-analytical study of photon orbits, obtaining the critical impact parameter and the shadow radius for different parameter combinations. Subsequently, we perform numerical ray-tracing simulations using the \textsc{GYOTO} code, incorporating optically thick accretion disks and varying the observation angle. Our results reveal characteristic signatures, including the formation of double-ring structures and deformations of the shadow radius, which can serve as observational discriminators between classical black holes and \emph{black-bounce} solutions.

 - **Abstract**
 The unstably bound, critical null geodesics of the Kerr spacetime form a distinguished class of orbits whose properties govern observables such as the photon ring and the high-frequency component of black-hole ringdown. This set of orbits defines a codimension-two submanifold of the null-geodesic phase space known as the photon shell. In this work we investigate the photon shell's intrinsic symplectic geometry. Using the induced symplectic form, we construct the canonical volume form on the shell and compute the differential phase-space volume it encloses as a function of radius -- equivalently, the radial density of states. In the near-extremal limit the photon shell bifurcates into near-horizon and far-region components; we find that approximately $3\%$ of the shell's phase-space volume resides in the near-horizon component. We also analyze a thickening of the photon shell that includes near-critical orbits, and compute its differential phase-space volume. Beyond their intrinsic theoretical interest, these results may inform the interpretation of high-resolution observations of spinning black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a theory-agnostic framework to search for extra-fundamental modes in the ringdown phase of black hole mergers. These modes, distinct from standard General Relativity (GR) deviations, originate from modifications of the theory of gravity. Applying our method to the events GW150914, GW190521, and GW200129, we find no significant evidence for extra modes beyond those expected in GR.

 We present the invariant characterization of the region where vacuum breakdown into electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) pairs occurs due to an overcritical electric field, the dyadoregion, in the case of a Kerr black hole (BH) in the presence of an external, asymptotically uniform test magnetic field aligned with the BH rotation axis, using the Wald solution. We calculate the dyadoregion morphology, the electromagnetic energy available for the pairs, the pair-creation rate, the number density of pairs, the average energy per pair, and their energy density and pressure. These results provide initial conditions for simulating the subsequent dynamics of the pair-produced plasma and astrophysical applications in the context of high-energy transients involving BHs in strong electromagnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 The Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process is a pivotal mechanism to efficiently extract the energy from a rotating black hole (BH) via its plasma-filled magnetosphere in relativistic astrophysics. Within the framework of extended BZ monopole expansion, we have studied BZ process in the Randall-Sundrum braneworld BH spacetime and analyzed effects of the tidal charge on the energy and angular momentum extraction rates. It is found that the positive tidal charge reduces the BZ power of a braneworld BH, while the negative tidal charge enhances the power. Compared with a Kerr BH of the same mass and angular velocity, the BZ power exhibits a maximum reduction of approximately $15.2\%$ in positive cases, whereas in negative cases, it achieves a maximum enhancement of $66.5\%$ in power output. A similar qualitative trend is also observed for the relative angular momentum extraction rate, albeit with different magnitudes.

 - **Abstract**
 We extend the isolated horizon formalism to include rotating black holes arising in five dimensional Einstein- Gauss- Bonnet (EGB) theory of gravity, and derive the laws of black hole mechanics. This result allows us to show that the first law of black hole mechanics is modified, due to the Gauss- Bonnet term, so as to include corrections to (i) the area of horizon cross- sections and, to (ii) the expression of horizon angular momentum. Once these modifications are included, the Hamiltonian generates an evolution on the space of solutions of the EGB theory admitting isolated horizon as an internal boundary, the consequence of which is the first law of black hole mechanics. These boundary conditions may help in the search for exact solutions describing rotating black holes in this theory.

 - **Abstract**
 We represent a new approach to exploring the thermodynamic topology of black holes, without introducing the nonphysical variable $\Theta\in[0,\pi]$ considered in previous studies, where black holes can exchange both energy and matter with the environment, leading to a thermal and chemical equilibrium. We construct a conserved topological tensor based on the gradient flow of the off-shell grand free energy corresponding to a two-dimensional or higher-dimensional vector field whose zeros are black hole solutions. We obtain a topological charge that is the sum of the index of all zeros. We find that black holes that share the same background geometry would have the same topological charge, hence they belong to the same kind of solutions. This point implies that the topological charge characterizing the black hole thermodynamics is also an invariant of spacetime, leading to valuable insight into the observed cosmological constant and the AdS distance conjecture.

 - **Abstract**
 Modified gravity theories with a nonminimal coupling between curvature and matter offer a compelling alternative to dark energy and dark matter by introducing an explicit interaction between matter and curvature invariants. Two of the main consequences of such an interaction are the emergence of an additional force and the non-conservation of the energy--momentum tensor, which can be interpreted as an energy exchange between matter and geometry. By adopting this interpretation, one can then take advantage of many different approaches in order to investigate the phenomenon of gravitationally induced particle creation. One of these approaches relies on the so-called irreversible thermodynamics of open systems formalism. By considering the scalar--tensor formulation of one of these theories, we derive the corresponding particle creation rate, creation pressure, and entropy production, demonstrating that irreversible particle creation can drive a late-time de Sitter acceleration through a negative creation pressure, providing a natural alternative to the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized second law of thermodynamics holds: the total entropy, from both the apparent horizon and enclosed matter, increases monotonically and saturates in the de Sitter phase, imposing constraints on the allowed particle production dynamics. Furthermore, we present brief reviews of other theoretical descriptions of matter creation processes. Specifically, we consider approaches based on the Boltzmann equation and quantum-based aspects and discuss the generalization of the Klein--Gordon equation, as well as the problem of its quantization in time-varying gravitational fields.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate geodesic motion and gravitational-wave signatures of charged black holes with scalar hair. Using the effective potential approach, we analyze marginally bound orbits and innermost stable circular orbits, showing how their positions and energy thresholds are modified by the scalar hair parameter $r_B$. These results demonstrate scalar hair's role in altering the boundary of stable motion. We further explore periodic orbits characterized by rational frequency ratios, labeled by the index $(z,w,v)$, and quantify how scalar hair affects their orbital energy and angular momentum. Based on these orbital properties, we compute gravitational waveforms from extreme mass-ratio inspirals where a stellar-mass compact object orbits a supermassive charged black hole with scalar hair. Using the numerical kludge method, we generate waveforms that exhibit clear zoom-whirl patterns with morphology visibly affected by $r_B$. Our results show that scalar hair leaves distinguishable imprints on waveforms, suggesting future space-based detectors could probe deviations from classical black hole spacetimes through extreme mass-ratio inspirals observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the dynamical instability of a self-gravitating thermal system in the quantum regime, where Fermi degeneracy pressure becomes significant. Using a truncated Fermi-Dirac distribution and solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, we identify marginally stable configurations following Chandrasekhar's criterion. While Fermi pressure stabilizes a system against gravitational collapse in Newtonian gravity, in general relativity it can instead drive the instability, enabling collapse even at low temperatures. We discuss implications for the formation of massive black holes in the early Universe through the gravothermal collapse of dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the Zassenhaus decomposition for the exponential of the sum of two non-commuting operators, simplifies drastically when these operators satisfy a simple condition, called the no-mixed adjoint property. An important application to a Unitary Coupled Cluster method for strongly correlated electron systems is presented. This ansatz requires no Trotterization and is exact on a quantum computer with a finite number of Givens gate equals to the number of free parameters. The formulas obtained in this work also shed light on why and when optimization after Trotterization gives exact solutions in disentangled forms of unitary coupled cluster.

#### Novel black saddles for 5d gravitational indices and the index enigma

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a series of novel Euclidean multi-black-hole, black ring, black Saturn, and black lens solutions to $5d$ supergravity that contribute as saddle-points to the $5d$ gravitational supersymmetric index, either in asymptotically flat space or in asymptotically AdS$_3\times S^2$. All these solutions are supersymmetric, have finite temperature, and an appropriate angular velocity turned on that makes fermionic fields periodic around the thermal circle. They contribute either to the helicity supertrace of supergravity in $5d$ flat space or to the elliptic genus of a supergravity theory in AdS$_3 \times S^2$. Their on-shell actions are independent of temperature, as consistent with the computation of a protected index, and equal to the entropy of the corresponding extremal black object. Our construction relies on uplifting saddles that can be singular in $4d$, but which are desingularized in $5d$. The resulting saddles exhibit a novel ``index enigma'', not encountered in previous Lorentzian solutions. One example of this enigma is that, in the computation of the index in asymptotically flat space, less symmetric black ring saddles dominate over the contributions from $5d$ black holes.

#### A Cardy-like expression for charged rotating solitons and black holes

 - **Abstract**
 This paper aims to propose a Cardy-like formula characterized by the mass, charge, and angular components of the black hole, along with their corresponding solitonic configuration, obtained through a double Wick rotation. The expression also incorporates the dynamical exponent and effective spatial dimensionality as key elements. To validate the proposal, we first present a new concrete example in which recovering the semiclassical entropy requires the soliton to possess thermodynamic quantities beyond its mass. Additionally, we show more examples derived from static black hole solutions, employing a Lorentz boost to calculate their thermodynamic parameters. Finally, we include a case of a rotating configuration where the Lorentz boost is not required.

#### Islands in Kerr-Newman Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the information paradox in the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman black hole by employing the recently proposed island paradigm. We first consider the quantum filed in the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman spacetime. By employing the near-horizon limit, we demonstrate that the field can be effectively described by a reduced two-dimensional field. Consequently, the formula of entanglement entropy in CFT$_2$ can be naturally adapted to this reduced two-dimensional theory. Under the framework of this reduced two-dimensional theory, we show that the entanglement entropy of radiation for the non-extremal case satisfies the unitarity in the later stage of the appearance of the entanglement islands. We further examine the impact of angular momentum and charges on the Page time and the scrambling time. Both quantities increases as the angular momentum increases, while decreases as the charge increases. At last, we consider the near extremal case. Resort to the Kerr/CFT correspondence, the near-horizon geometry of near extremal Kerr-Newman black holes can be taken account for a warped AdS geometry. In this scenario, the low-energy effective degrees of freedom are dominated by the Schwarzian zero mode, resulting in a one-loop correction to the partition function. The entanglement entropy is subsequently recalculated under the thermodynamic with corrections. Through explicit calculations, we finally find that the Page time and the scrambling time exhibits quantum delays. This strongly suggests that the near extremal geometry is governed by the Schwarzschild dynamics, in which quantum fluctuations result in a reduced rate of information leakage. Our findings further substantiate the conservation of information and extend the applicability of the island paradigm to the most general stationary spacetime background.
