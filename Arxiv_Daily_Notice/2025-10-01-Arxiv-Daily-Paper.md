#### Cosmological tensions in the era of precision cosmology: Insights from Tensions in Cosmology 2025

 - **Abstract**
 The ``Tensions in Cosmology'' series of conferences has been established as one of the main venues where the cosmological community collectively assesses the cracks in the concordance model and explores possible theoretical and observational remedies. The 2025 edition, held once again in Corfu, Greece, came at a crucial time: the Hubble constant $H_0$ discrepancy has now exceeded $6\sigma$, and new high-precision data from DESI, JWST, ACT, and other facilities have made this tension more robust while opening new windows on the early and late Universe. The $S_8$ tension, though milder and survey-dependent, remains an important probe of late-time structure formation, while emerging anomalies involving dynamical dark energy and neutrino physics are gaining increasing attention as potential signs of physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM. Here we provide a report on the meeting and an update on the state of the tensions in 2025, highlighting progress since the pioneering 2022 event.

 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of binary black hole (BBH) masses and its evolution with redshift provide key insights into the different formation channels of the compact objects and their evolution with cosmic time and stellar properties such stellar metallicity and star formation rate history. We present a non parametric, model-independent joint reconstruction of the redshift evolution of BBH mass distribution from gravitational wave (GW) catalog GWTC-4.0 from the fourth observation of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). This method simultaneously searches for the signature of any linear and quadratic redshift evolution with respect to the low redshift in a Bayesian framework taking into accounting the detector selection effects. We find tentative evidence for a linear redshift-dependent evolution of the mass distribution, consistent over a mass range ($m \gtrsim 50\,M_\odot$). While lower mass systems shows no signature of evolution. The quadratic term remains consistent with zero, indicating that a simple linear dependence adequately describes the population up to redshift $z \sim 1$. In future with more GW sources, this technique can shed light into the true nature of the redshift dependence and possibility to uncover subtle evolutionary features in BBH populations and to probe the cosmic history of black hole formation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present updated observational constraints on the spatially flat $\phi$CDM model, where dark energy is described by a minimally coupled scalar field $\phi$ with an inverse power-law potential $V=V_0 \phi^{-\alpha}$. Using Planck 2018 CMB temperature, polarization (P18), and lensing power spectra (lensing), along with a compilation of non-CMB data including baryon acoustic oscillation, type Ia supernova, Hubble parameter, and growth rate measurements, we constrain $\phi$CDM and $\phi$CDM+$A_L$ models where $A_L$ is the CMB lensing consistency parameter. The scalar field parameter $\alpha$, which governs dark energy dynamics, is more tightly constrained by non-CMB data than by CMB data alone. For the full dataset, we obtain $\alpha = 0.055 \pm 0.041$ in the $\phi$CDM model and $\alpha = 0.095 \pm 0.056$ in the $\phi$CDM+$A_L$ model, mildly favoring evolving dark energy over a cosmological constant by $1.3\sigma$ and $1.7\sigma$. The Hubble constant is $H_0=67.55_{-0.46}^{+0.53}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ in the $\phi$CDM model, consistent with median statistics and some local determinations, but in tension with other local determinations. The constraints for matter density and clustering amplitude ($\Omega_m = 0.3096 \pm 0.0055$, $\sigma_8 = 0.8013_{-0.0067}^{+0.0077}$) of the flat $\phi$CDM model statistically agree with $\Lambda$CDM model values. Allowing $A_L$ to vary reduces tensions between CMB and non-CMB data, although we find $A_L = 1.105 \pm 0.037$, $2.8\sigma$ higher than unity, consistent with the excess smoothing seen in Planck data. Model comparison using AIC and DIC indicates that the $\phi$CDM model provides a fit comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, with the $\phi$CDM+$A_L$ slightly preferred. Overall, while the $\Lambda$CDM model remains an excellent fit, current data leave open the possibility of mildly evolving quintessence-like dynamical dark energy.

#### Searching for Dark Structures: A Comparison of Weak Lensing Convergence Maps and Lensing-Weighted Galaxy Density Maps

 - **Abstract**
 We present the result of a comparison between the dark matter distribution inferred from weak gravitational lensing and the observed galaxy distribution to identify dark structures with a high dark matter-to-galaxy density ratio. To do this, we use weak lensing convergence maps from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 data, and construct corresponding galaxy convergence maps at $z\lesssim1.0$, representing projected galaxy number density fluctuations weighted by lensing efficiency. The two maps show overall agreement. However, we could identify 22 regions where the dark matter density exhibits an excess compared to the galaxy density. After carefully examining the survey depths and proximity to survey boundaries, we select seven of the most probable candidates for dark structures. This sample provides valuable testbeds for further investigations into dark matter mapping. Moreover, our method will be very useful for future studies of dark structures as large-scale weak-lensing surveys become available, such as the $\textit{Euclid}$ mission, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

#### Excursion Set Approach to Primordial Black Holes: Cloud-in-Cloud and Mass Function Revisited

 - **Abstract**
 The abundance and mass function of primordial black holes (PBHs) are often estimated using the Press-Schechter (PS) formalism. In the case of halo formation, the PS formalism suffers from the miscounting of regions collapsing into halos, known as the cloud-in-cloud problem, which is usually corrected by introducing a multiplicative `fudge factor 2'. By analogy, this factor has sometimes been applied to PBH calculations, although its validity has remained unsettled. We reformulate the PS approach for PBHs within the excursion-set framework, where the smoothed density contrast undergoes a stochastic random walk as the smoothing scale varies and collapse is identified with the first threshold crossing. While the halo case is described by a Markovian process, we show that the PBH case is non-Markovian, even when the sharp-k filter Window function is adopted. Decomposing the total collapse probability into two distinct components of the stochastic motion, we numerically confirm that their contributions are exactly equal in the case of halo formation, justifying the fudge factor. For PBHs, however, we demonstrate that this equality no longer holds, and consistent inclusion of both contributions is essential to ensure a positive-definite mass function. Our results clarify the origin of the ambiguity surrounding the fudge factor and establish a robust theoretical foundation for PBH abundance calculations.

#### A fast powerful X-ray transient from tidal disruption of a white dwarf

 - **Abstract**
 Stars captured by black holes (BHs) can be tore apart by strong tidal force, producing electromagnetic flares. Some 100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been observed, involving invariably normal gaseous stars whose debris falls onto the BH fueling the flares over years. White dwarfs (WDs)-the most prevalent compact stars a million times denser and thus tougher than gaseous stars-can only be disrupted by intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of 10^2-10^5 solar masses. WD-TDEs are predicted to generate more powerful and short-lived flares, but their evidence has been lacking. Here we report observations of a fast, luminous X-ray transient EP250702a. Its one-day-long peak showed strong recurrent flares extending to several tens of MeV in gamma-rays, indicating relativistic jet emission. The jet X-rays dropped sharply from exceeding 3 x 10^49 to around 10^44 erg/s within 20 days. These characteristics are inconsistent with any known transient phenomena other than a jetted-TDE evolving within a short timespan previously unseen-indicating the disruption of a white dwarf by an IMBH. At late times, a new soft component progressively dominates the X-ray spectrum, exhibiting extreme super-Eddington luminosity, possibly from an accretion disc. WD-TDEs open a new window to study elusive IMBHs and the otherwise invisible interior of degenerate stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) are astrophysical phenomena arising when stars are disrupted by supermassive black holes. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), with its unprecedented depth and cadence, will detect thousands of TDEs, motivating the need for robust photometric classifiers capable of efficiently distinguishing these events from other extragalactic transients. We aim to develop and validate a machine learning pipeline for photometric TDE identification in LSST-scale datasets. Our classifier is designed to provide high precision and recall, enabling the construction of reliable TDE catalogs for multi-messenger follow-up and statistical studies. Using the second Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC2) dataset, we fit Gaussian Processes (GP) to light curves for feature extraction (e.g., color, rise/fade times, GP length scales). We then train and tune boosted decision-tree models (XGBoost) with a custom scoring function emphasizing high-precision recovery of TDEs. Our pipeline is tested on a diverse simulation of transient and variable events, including supernovae, active galactic nuclei, and superluminous supernovae. We achieve high precision (up to 95%) while maintaining competitive recall (about 72%) for TDEs, with minimal contamination from non-TDE classes. Key predictive features include post-peak colors and GP hyperparameters, reflecting characteristic timescales and spectral behaviors of TDEs. Our photometric classifier provides a practical and scalable approach to identifying TDEs in forthcoming LSST data. By capturing essential color and temporal properties through GP-based feature extraction, it enables efficient construction of clean TDE candidate samples.

#### Time-Dependent obscuration of a tidal disruption event candidate in the active galactic nucleus CSS100217

 - **Abstract**
 CSS100217 is considered a peculiar tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate occurring in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Unlike typical TDEs, where the post-flare luminosity is equal to that pre-flare, CSS100217 decayed to $\sim$ 0.4 magnitudes fainter than its pre-flare V band level. In this manuscript, we propose an obscured TDE model to explain the light curve of CSS100217. Assuming that the time-dependent obscuration, caused by the TDE unbound stellar debris, or by nuclear clouds moving around the supermassive black hole (SMBH), follows a Weibull distribution, we find that the light curve of CSS100217 can be described by the tidal disruption of a $4.6_{-0.9}^{+0.9}{\rm M_\odot}$ main-sequence star by a $3.3_{-0.3}^{+0.3}\times10^7{\rm M_\odot}$ black hole. The total energy of the event derived from our fit is $7.23\times10^{53}$ ergs and about 1.38 ${\rm M_\odot}$ of debris mass is accreted by the central SMBH. The model indicates that the contribution of the host galaxy to the observed pre-flare optical luminosity is not-significant compared to that of the AGN, which is consistent with the results of the spectral analysis. These results suggest that obscuration may play an important role in explaining the unusual TDE-like variability observed in CSS100217.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper reports the discovery and follow-up of four candidate redback spider pulsars: GPM J1723-33, GPM J1734-28, GPM J1752-30 and GPM J1815-14, discovered with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) from an imaging survey of the Galactic Plane. These sources are considered to be redback candidates based on their eclipsing variability, steep negative spectral indices, and potential Fermi $\gamma$-ray associations, with GPM J1723-33 and GPM J1815-14 lying within a Fermi 95% error ellipse. Follow-up pulsation searches with MeerKAT confirmed pulsations from GPM J1723-33, while the non-detections of the other three are likely due to scattering by material ablated from their companion stars. We identify possible orbital periods by applying folding algorithms to the light curves and determine that all sources have short orbital periods (<24 hours), consistent with redback spider systems. Following up on the sources at multiple radio frequencies revealed that the sources exhibit frequency-dependent eclipses, with longer eclipses observed at lower frequencies. We place broad constraints on the eclipse medium, ruling out induced Compton scattering and cyclotron absorption. Three sources are spatially consistent with optical sources in the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey imaging, which may contain the optical counterparts. Each field is affected by strong dust extinction, and follow-up with large telescopes is needed to identify the true counterparts. Identifying potential radio counterparts to four previously unassociated Fermi sources brings us closer to understanding the origin of the unexplained $\gamma$-ray excess in the Galactic Centre.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\Lambda$CDM model has long served as the cornerstone of modern cosmology, offering an elegant and successful framework for interpreting a wide range of cosmological observations. However, the rise of high-precision datasets has revealed statistically significant tensions, most notably the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ discrepancy, which challenge the completeness of this standard model. In this context, we explore the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model-an extension of $\Lambda$CDM featuring a single additional parameter, $z_\dagger$, corresponding to a sign-switching cosmological constant. This minimal modification aims to alleviate key observational tensions without compromising the model's overall coherence. Recent findings present in the literature indicate that the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model not only provides a better fit to Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data for $z_\dagger < 2.3$, but also accommodates both the SH0ES measurement of $H_0$ and the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface when 2D BAO data are included. We present a comprehensive analysis combining the full Planck 2018 CMB data, the Pantheon Type Ia Supernovae sample, and the recently released Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our finding reveal that the Preliminary DESI results, a possible $3.9\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM expectations, reinforce the importance of exploring such dynamic dark energy frameworks. In sum, our study underscores the potential of $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM to reconcile multiple cosmological tensions and sheds light on the role of upcoming high-precision observations in reshaping our understanding of the universe's expansion history and the nature of dark energy.

#### Cosmological constraints on non-phantom dynamical dark energy with DESI Data Release 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations: A 3$σ$+ lensing anomaly

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26144

 - **Abstract**
 We consider a 12-parameter cosmological model with non-phantom dynamical dark energy (NPDDE), where non-phantom implies that the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy (DE), $w(z)\geq-1$ for all redshifts $z$. Thus, the DE EoS covers the parameter space corresponding to the popular single scalar-field dark energy models, i.e., Quintessence. The cosmological model comprises 6 parameters of the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, and additionally the dynamical DE EoS parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), the scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A_{\rm lens}$), sum of the neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu$), the effective number of non-photon relativistic degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm eff}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). We derive constraints on the parameters by combining the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra from Planck Public Release (PR) 4, CMB lensing data from Planck PR4 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6, uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data from the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing (WL) data from DES Year 1. Our major finding is that with CMB+BAO+WL and CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, we find 3$\sigma$+ evidence for $A_{\rm lens} >1$, indicating a higher than expected CMB lensing amplitude relative to the NPDDE prediction of unity. This implies that for cosmology to accommodate realistic quintessence-like dark energy models (as opposed to unrealistic phantom DE), one would also need to explain a relatively significant presence of the lensing anomaly.

#### Testing the nature of GW200105 by probing the frequency evolution of eccentricity

 - **Abstract**
 GW200105 is a compact binary coalescence (CBC) event, consisting of a neutron star and a black hole, observed in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's (LVK's) third observing run (O3). Recent reanalyses of the event using state-of-the-art waveform models have claimed observation of signatures of an eccentric orbit. It has nevertheless been pointed out in the literature that certain physical or modified gravity effects could mimic eccentricity by producing a spurious non-zero eccentricity value, at a given reference frequency, when recovered with an eccentric waveform model. We recently developed a model-independent Eccentricity Evolution Consistency Test (EECT, S. A. Bhat et al. 2025) to identify such mimickers, by comparing the measured frequency $\textit{evolution}$ of eccentricity, $e(f)$, with that expected from General Relativity (GR). In this $\textit{Letter}$, we apply EECT to GW200105 and find that it satisfies EECT within 68% confidence. Our analysis therefore lends complementary support in favour of the eccentricity hypothesis, while also providing a novel test of the consistency of $e(f)$ with GR.

#### General Relativity Can Prevent a Runaway Greenhouse on Potentially Habitable Planets Orbiting White Dwarfs

 - **Abstract**
 Planets orbiting in the habitable zones of white dwarfs have recently been proposed as promising targets for biosignature searches. However, since the white dwarf habitable zone resides at 0.01 - 0.1 AU, planets residing there are subject to tidal heating if they have any orbital eccentricity. Previous work (Barnes & Heller 2013) identified nearby planetary companions as potential roadblocks to habitability of planets around white dwarfs, as such companions could induce secular oscillations in eccentricity for the potentially habitable planet, which could in turn heat a surface ocean and induce a runaway greenhouse for even very low values ($e \sim 10^{-4}$) of the eccentricity of the potentially habitable planet. In this work, we examine the potential for general relativistic orbital precession to protect habitable planets orbiting white dwarfs from such a runaway greenhouse, and demonstrate that for some system architectures, general relativity can be protective for planetary habitability.

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation large-scale structure spectroscopic surveys will probe cosmology at high redshifts $(2.3 < z < 3.5)$, relying on abundant galaxy tracers such as Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) and Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). Medium-band photometry has emerged as a potential technique for efficiently selecting these high-redshift galaxies. In this work, we present clustering analysis of medium-band selected galaxies at high redshift, utilizing photometric data from the Intermediate Band Imaging Survey (IBIS) and spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We interpret the clustering of such samples using both Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) modeling and a perturbation theory description of large-scale structure. Our modeling indicates that the current target sample is composed from an overlapping mixture of LAEs and LBGs with emission lines. Despite differences in target selection, we find that the clustering properties are consistent with previous studies, with correlation lengths $r_0\simeq 3-4\,h^{-1}$Mpc and a linear bias of $b\sim1.8-2.5$. Finally, we discuss the simulation requirements implied by these measurements and demonstrate that the properties of the samples would make them excellent targets to enhance our understanding of the high-$z$ universe.

#### Tests of Evolving Dark Energy with Geometric Probes of the Late Late-Time Universe

 - **Abstract**
 Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have shown a strong statistical preference for a time-evolving dark energy model over $\Lambda$CDM when combining BAO, CMB, and supernova (SN) data. We investigate the robustness of this conclusion by isolating geometric information in weak lensing measurements from the DES Year 3 survey and combining it with different datasets. We introduce a hyperparameter, $\Omega_{\rm m}^{\rm growth}$, to decouple the growth contribution from the lensing 2-point correlation and thus bypass the possible effect of the $\sigma_8$ tension in our analysis. We then combine with the late-time geometric probes provided by BAO and SN, along with CMB primary data. The preference for evolving dark energy is consistent with the DESI-DR2 findings: when combining BAO, primary CMB, and weak lensing data, the $w_0w_a$CDM is preferred at about the $3\sigma$ significance. However, when we add SN, the result is sensitive to the choice of data: if we leave out $z<0.1$ SN data in the analysis, as a test of the effect of inhomogeneous calibration, we obtain a statistical significance below $2\sigma$ for time evolving dark energy. Indeed, the high-z only SN data \textbf{lowers} the evidence for evolving dark energy in all the data combinations we have examined. This underscores the importance of improved SN samples at low redshift and of alternative data combinations. We show that cosmic shear measurements with LSST Year 1 data will provide comparable power to current SN data. We discuss other low-redshift probes provided by lensing and galaxy clustering to test for evolving dark energy.

#### The Connection between Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies and the First Massive Quenched Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift (z > 2) massive quiescent (MQ) galaxies provide an opportunity to probe the key physical processes driving the fuelling and quenching of star formation in the early Universe. Observational evidence suggests a possible evolutionary link between MQs and dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs; or submillimetre galaxies), another extreme high-redshift population. However, galaxy formation models have historically struggled to reproduce these populations - especially simultaneously - limiting our understanding of their formation and connection, particularly in light of recent JWST findings. In previous work, we presented a re-calibrated version of the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model that provides an improved match to observationally-inferred number densities of both DSFG and MQ populations. In this work, we use this new model to investigate the progenitors of MQs at z > 2 and the physical mechanisms that lead to their quenching. We find that most MQs at z > 2 were sub-millimetre-bright ($S_{870}$ > 1 mJy) at some point in their cosmic past. The stellar mass of MQs is strongly correlated with the maximum submillimetre flux density attained over their history, and this relation appears to be independent of redshift. However, only a minority of high-redshift DSFGs evolve into MQs by z = 2. The key distinction between typical DSFGs and MQ progenitors lies in their merger histories: MQ progenitors experience an early major merger that triggers a brief, intense starburst and rapid black hole growth, depleting their cold gas reservoirs. In our model, AGN feedback subsequently prevents further gas cooling, resulting in quenching. In contrast, the broader DSFG population remains sub-millimetre-bright, with star formation proceeding primarily via secular processes, becoming quenched later.

 - **Abstract**
 The research paper investigates the thermodynamic behavior of a black hole in a cloud of strings (CoS) and perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM), incorporating a minor correction to the Anti de Sitter (AdS) length scale. The study reveals that while the entropy remains unaffected by the AdS length correction, other thermodynamic quantities such as enthalpy, free energy, pressure, internal energy, Gibbs free energy, and heat capacity exhibit significant modifications. Positive corrections to the AdS length generally enhance these quantities, leading to faster growth or slower decay with increasing black hole size, while negative corrections often produce the opposite effect, sometimes resulting in divergent or negative values. These findings highlight the sensitivity of black hole thermodynamics to geometric corrections and exotic matter fields, providing deeper information about the interplay between such modifications and thermodynamic stability. These results underscore the importance of considering minor corrections in theoretical models to better understand black hole behavior in the presence of dark matter and string-like matter distributions.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how inflation can emerge from four-fermion interactions generated by spacetime torsion, eliminating the need for additional scalar fields beyond the Standard Model. We partition fermions in two sectors and introduce two bound fields. In the effective theory approach, once all the fermions have been integrated out, the bound fields serve as the inflaton and the auxiliary field, in analogy to the hybrid inflation and accounting for a waterfall (hybrid) mechanism. The inclusion of an axial chemical potential naturally facilitates the end of reheating. During the waterfall regime, the effective potential governing the fermion condensate supports the formation of non-topological solitons, known as Q-balls, which can be accounted for seeding primordial black holes (PBHs).

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study the gravitational wave (GW) memory effect for a black hole embedded in a dark matter halo described by a Hernquist-type density profile, both with and without a spike. We first solve the geodesic equations in this spacetime under the influence of a GW pulse to examine how the combined effects of the dark matter halo and the GW pulse modify the geodesic deviation equation and particle trajectories. We then investigate how the memory effect manifests in the waveform in the presence of the dark matter halo. To do that, we analyze the memory contribution at asymptotic null infinity using the Bondi-Sachs formalism and, in particular, the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) flux balance laws associated with BMS symmetries. This framework allows us to quantify the GW memory contribution to the waveform, incorporate it into the ringdown waveform templates, and thereby provide a possible avenue for extracting information about the dark matter halo parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave (GW) experiments have transformed our understanding of the Universe by enabling direct observations of compact object mergers and other astrophysical phenomena. This chapter reviews the concepts of GW detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, and describes their operating principles, data acquisition and analysis techniques, and some of the methods used to extract source properties. The scientific impact of GW observations is discussed as well, including contributions to astrophysics, tests of general relativity, and cosmology. We also examine the role of multimessenger astronomy and the complementarity between different GW detectors and with other astroparticle experiments. Finally, we outline future prospects with next-generation detectors, like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, and space-based missions.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the tidal disruption of a neutron star (NS) near a black hole (BH), and for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, near a naked singularity (NaS). For a BH with a mass greater than about $10 M_{\odot}$, the tidal disruption of NS should occur within the event horizon, and hence neither can the stellar material escape nor a distant observer observe the disruption. Since NaS does not have an event horizon, a significant portion of the NS's material can escape, and the tidal disruption can be observed by a distant observer. One could identify such an event from the observed emission from the disrupted NS's material and the decay of the light curve of the disruption event. The escape of a significant fraction of the NS's material may also have implications for the heavy elements in the universe. Moreover, observing such an event can be useful for confirming a NaS, probing its spacetime, and studying the motion of matter in such a geometry. This may help constrain the NS parameters and equation of state models. As a first step in this direction, we calculate here the tidal disruption radius and other parameters for a specific type (Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan type 1) of NaS and compare our results with observations.

#### Using precession and Lense-Thirring effect to constrain a rotating regular black hole

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the frame-dragging effect on an accretion disk and test gyroscope orbiting around a rotating regular black hole with a Minkowski core. Firstly, we perturb a bound timelike circular orbit around the black hole, and analyze the periastron precession and Lense-Thirring (LT) precession frequencies of the orbit's epicyclic oscillations. Since these epicyclic oscillations can be used to explain the quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) phenomena of the accretion disc around this rotating regular black hole, we then employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation to fit our theoretical results with five QPOs events (GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105, XTE J1859+226, H1743-322 and XTE J1550-564). The simulations give the relevant physical parameter space of the black hole, including the characteristic radius $r$, the mass related parameter $M$, the spinning parameter $a$ and the quantum gravity effect $\alpha$. The results give the constraint on the quantum effect parameter, with an upper limit $\alpha/M^{3/2} < 0.60$ at the $95\%$ C.L., which is tighter than $<0.7014$ in our pervious study within static case. Then, we theoretically explore the LT precession frequency, geodetic precession frequency, and the general spin precession frequency of a test gyro attached to a stationary observer in this black hole background. We find that the quantum gravity effect suppresses the precession frequencies comparing against those in Kerr black hole, further providing a theoretical diagnostic of the potential quantum gravity effect.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate regular rotating black holes predicted by asymptotically safe gravity, where the Newton constant varies with energy scale and modifies the near horizon geometry. These solutions remain asymptotically flat and avoid central singularities while differing from the classical Kerr spacetime in the strong field region. We compute the radiative efficiency of thin accretion disks and the jet power from the Blandford Znajek mechanism, both of which depend on the deformation parameter of the model. The predictions are compared with observational estimates for six stellar mass black holes. For systems with low or moderate spin the model reproduces the data within reported uncertainties, while rapidly spinning sources such as GRS 1915 105 present tensions and point to a restricted deformation range or the need for additional physics. The results show that quantum corrections confined to the strong gravity regime can still leave detectable imprints on high energy astrophysical processes. Radiative and jet based diagnostics therefore provide a promising method to test the geometry near the horizon and to explore possible signatures of quantum gravity in observations.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper is a comprehensive investigation of the Affine Gauge Theory (AGT) as a gauge theory of gravity having the same mathematical structure as gauge theories of the other fundamental forces of nature. This mathematical structure consists of a principal fiber bundle over the spacetime manifold that is endowed with an affine connection. The relationship between AGT and various formulations of teleparallel theories of gravity, which are alternatives to General Relativity, are examined. Here, it is argued that the Affine Bundle is the most natural principal fibre bundle for a gauge theory of gravity. AGT is also shown to be strictly diffeomorphism invariant. In particular, an explicit proof of diffeomorphism invariance in AGT is given - showing that AGT possesses the important symmetry of General Relativity, as would be expected from a theory of gravity. Lastly, the claim that AGT is background independent, as General Relativity is, from varying degrees of strictness in the definition of background independence is closely examined. Reasons for why a background independent theory is preferred are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper answers examines the relationship between Diffeomorphism Invariance and Background Independence. First, a review of the relationship between Background Independence, General Relativity (GR) and pre-GR theories are given. Then, a wide range of other conceptions of background independence is discussed. It is shown that the definition of Background Independence is fluid and can mean different things to different philosophers and/or physicists. Most pertinently, the paper addresses the question of what kind of background independence is implied by a mathematical criterion of diffeomorphism invariance or in what sense is diffeomorphism invariance background independence. Lastly, the concept of haecceity in relation to diffeomorphism invariance is discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical relativity simulations provide a means by which to study the evolution and end point of strong over-densities in cosmological spacetimes. Specific applications include studies of primordial black hole formation and the robustness of inflation. Here we adopt a toy model previously used in asymptotically flat spacetimes to show that, for given values of the over-density and the mean curvature, solutions to the Hamiltonian constraint need not exist, and if they do exist they are not unique. Specifically, pairs of solutions exist on two branches, corresponding to strong-field and weak-field solutions, that join at a maximum beyond which solutions cease to exist. As a result, there is a limit to the extent to which an over-density can be balanced by intrinsic rather than extrinsic curvature on the initial slice. Even below this limit, iterative methods to construct initial data may converge to solutions on either one of the two branches, depending on the starting guess, leading to potentially inconsistent physical results in the evolution.

#### Null matter and the ultrarelativistic origin of hydrodynamics at zero temperature

 - **Abstract**
 We uncover a universal sector of relativistic fluid dynamics by taking a novel ultrarelativistic limit in which the temperature tends to zero while the flow simultaneously approaches the speed of light. In this regime, hydrodynamics becomes an effective theory of \emph{null matter}, characterised by a preferred null vector, a preferred scale, and their gradients. We show that this theory of null matter constitutes an example of a hydrodynamic theory that can be linearly stable and causal in an arbitrary choice of frame. The framework developed here for null matter can offer insights into ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, astrophysical phenomena with inherently large Lorentz factors, and the dynamics of black hole horizons.

#### An analytic approach for holographic entanglement entropy at (quantum) criticality

 - **Abstract**
 We consider holographic entanglement entropy in AdS black hole backgrounds by using the limit of large number of dimensions. By dividing the geometry to two patches (with one patch covering the vicinity of the black hole horizon and another covering the other regions), we are able to obtain fully analytic expressions for the entropy when the entanglement region is a strip. We argue that apart from conformal field theories at finite temperature in high number of dimensions, our method works for nearly critical theories in 3+1 dimensions. In the case of extremal black holes, dual to quantum critical systems, the results take a particularly simple form. We also comment on the case of soliton geometries. Finally, we analyze entanglement entropy for wide strips, and propose a general formula for the first subleading term in the expansion of the entropy in (inverse) system size for generic entanglement regions.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we perform a comprehensive study of the classical and quantum chaos in a candidate five-dimensional hairy AdS soliton. It is a horizonless geometry holographically dual to a confining field theory with finite scalar potential. We probe classical chaos by using particle geodesics and closed classical string. While the former shows no signature of chaos, the latter provides chaotic dynamics of the string using the Lyapunov exponent and the evolution of the Poincaré section. Further we perform an independent spectral analysis using the tools of the random matrix theory (RMT), namely the level space distributions and the Dyson-Mehta(DM) $\Delta_{3}$-statistics. We observe a clear transition from the low energy Wigner-Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) distribution to the high energy Poisson distribution. This signifies a flow from quantum chaos in the infrared to integrability in the ultraviolet. We quantitatively characterize the inherent quantum scrambling in the dual theory by computing the butterfly velocity, the rate of spatial spread of the information scrambling, inside the bulk. We undergo two independent holographic methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction and derivation of out-of-time-ordered correlators via shockwave analysis. In these methods, we heuristically treat the region near the soliton tip to analyse the infrared physics of scrambling similarly as done in the near-horizon region of black hole. We find that the hair parameter controls various scrambling properties. Finally, we make comments on the interplay between insulator/superconductor phase transition in hairy soliton geometry and dynamical transition from integrability to chaos as both of these are affected by the presence of the hair parameter.
