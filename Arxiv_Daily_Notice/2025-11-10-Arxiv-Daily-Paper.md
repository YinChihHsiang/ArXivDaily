 - **Abstract**
 The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with mass $M_\bullet > 10^9 \, \rm M_\odot$ hosted by high-redshift galaxies have challenged our understanding of black hole formation and growth, as several pathways have emerged attempting to explain their existence. The "heavy-seed" pathway eases the problem with the progenitors of these SMBHs having birth masses up to ${\sim} 10^5~{\rm M_\odot}$. Here, we investigate the possibility that a local dwarf galaxy, Leo I, harbors a heavy-seed descendant. Using Monte-Carlo merger trees to generate the merger histories of 1,000 dark matter halos similar to the Milky Way (MW; with a mass of ${\sim} 10^{12}~{\rm M_\odot}$ at redshift $z{=}0$). We search for Leo-like satellite halos among these merger trees, and investigate the probability that the progenitors of some of these satellites formed a heavy seed. We derive the likelihood of such "heavy seed survivors" (HSSs) across various formation and survival criteria as well as Leo-similarity criteria. We find that the virial temperature for the onset of atomic cooling and rapid gas infall that yields heavy seeds, $T_{\rm act}$, has the largest impact on the number of HSSs. We find HSSs in a fraction $0.7\%$, $18.1\%$, and $96.5\%$ of MW-like halos when $T_{\rm act}$ is set to $9,000$K, $7,000$K, and $5,000$K respectively. This suggests that Leo I could be hosting a heavy seed and could provide an opportunity to disentangle heavy seeds from other SMBH formation mechanisms.

 - **Abstract**
 Studies of the distant Universe are providing key insights into our understanding of the formation of galaxies. The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has significantly enhanced our observational capabilities, leading to an expanded redshift frontier, providing unprecedented detail in the characterization of early galaxies and enabling the discovery of new populations of accreting black holes. This review aims to provide an introduction to the basic processes and components that shape the observed spectra of galaxies, with a focus on their relevance to techniques with which high-redshift galaxies are selected. The review further introduces specific topics that have attracted significant attention in recent literature, including the discovery of highly efficient galaxy formation in the early Universe, the relation between galaxies and the process of reionization, new insights into the formation of the first stars and the enrichment of interstellar gas with heavy elements, and breakthroughs in our understanding of the origins of supermassive black holes.

#### Discovery of an X-ray Luminous Radio-Loud Quasar at $z=3.4$: A Possible Transitional Super-Eddington Phase

 - **Abstract**
 We report the multiwavelength properties of eFEDS J084222.9+001000 (hereafter ID830), a quasar at $z=3.4351$, identified as the most X-ray luminous radio-loud quasar in the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) field. ID830 shows a rest-frame 0.5-2 keV luminosity of $\log (L_\mathrm{0.5-2\,keV}/\mathrm{erg}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 46.20 \pm 0.12$, with a steep X-ray photon index ($\Gamma =2.43 \pm 0.21$), and a significant radio counterpart detected with VLA/FIRST 1.4 GHz and VLASS 3 GHz bands. The rest-frame UV to optical spectra from SDSS and Subaru/MOIRCS $J$-band show a dust reddened quasar feature with $A_\mathrm{V} = 0.39 \pm 0.08$ mag and the expected bolometric AGN luminosity from the dust-extinction-corrected UV luminosity reaches $L_\mathrm{bol,3000}= (7.62 \pm 0.31) \times 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We estimate the black hole mass of $M_\mathrm{BH} = (4.40 \pm 0.72) \times 10^{8} M_{\odot}$ based on the MgII$\lambda$2800 emission line width, and an Eddington ratio from the dust-extinction-corrected UV continuum luminosity reaches $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd,UV}=1.44 \pm 0.24$ and $\lambda_{\mathrm{Edd,X}} = 12.8 \pm 3.9$ from the X-ray luminosity, both indicating the super-Eddington accretion. ID830 shows a high ratio of UV-to-X-ray luminosities, $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}=-1.20 \pm 0.07$ (or $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}=-1.42 \pm 0.07$ after correcting for jet-linked X-ray excess), higher than quasars and little red dots in super-Eddington phase with similar UV luminosities, with $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}<-1.8$. Such a high $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}$ suggests the coexistence of a prominent radio jet and X-ray corona, in this high Eddington accretion phase. We propose that ID830 may be in a transitional phase after an accretion burst, evolving from a super-Eddington to a sub-Eddington state, which could naturally describe the high $\alpha_\mathrm{OX}$.

#### NGC 6860, Mrk 915, and MCG -01-24-012. II. Inflowing and outflowing cold molecular gas and the connection with ionized gas in Seyfert galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the cold molecular gas kinematics in the inner ~ 4-7 kpc (projected sizes) of three nearby Seyfert galaxies, with AGN luminosities of ~ 10$^{44}$ erg/s, using observations of the CO(2-1) emission line, obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at ~ 0.5-0.8$^{\prime\prime}$ (~ 150-400 pc) spatial resolutions. After modeling the CO profiles with multiple Gaussian components, we detected regions with double-peak profiles that exhibit kinematics distinct from the dominant rotational motion. In NGC 6860, a molecular outflow surrounding the bipolar emission of the [O III] ionized gas is observed extending up to $R_{out}$ ~ 560 pc from the nucleus. There is evidence of molecular inflows along the stellar bar, although an alternative scenario, involving a decoupled rotation in a circumnuclear disk (CND) can also explain the observed kinematics. Mrk 915 shows double-peak CO profiles along one of its spiral arms. Due to its ambiguous disk orientation, part of the CO emission can be interpreted as a molecular gas inflow or an outflow reaching $R_{out}$ ~ 2.8 kpc. MCG -01-24-012 has double-peak profiles associated with a CND, perpendicular to the [O III] bipolar emission. The CO in the CND is rotating while outflowing within $R_{out}$ ~ 3 kpc, with the disturbances possibly being caused by the passage of the ionized gas outflow. Overall, the mass inflow rates are larger than the accretion rate needed to produce the observed luminosities, suggesting that only a fraction of the inflowing gas ends up feeding the central black holes. Although we found signatures of AGN feedback on the cold molecular phase, the mass outflow rates of ~ 0.09-3 M$_\odot$/yr indicate an overall weak impact at these AGN luminosities. Nonetheless, we may be witnessing the start of the depletion and ejection of the molecular gas reservoir that has accumulated over time.

#### Searching for Electromagnetic Counterpart Candidates to GW231123

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of GW231123, a gravitational-wave (GW) event with exceptionally massive and rapidly spinning black holes, suggests the possible formation within an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk, which provides a favorable environment for potentially generating an observable electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. We conduct a search for such a counterpart by crossmatching the GW localization with a comprehensive catalog of AGN flares from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Our analysis yields six plausible optical flare candidates that are spatially and temporally coincident with GW231123 and exhibit significant deviations from their AGN baseline flux. Although these candidates represent a crucial first step, their true nature remains inconclusive. Confirming any one of these flares via future observations would provide a landmark validation of the AGN formation channel and unlock the multi-messenger potential of this extraordinary merger.

 - **Abstract**
 The scaling laws reveal the underlying structural similarities shared by astrophysical systems across vastly different scales. In black hole accretion systems, the scaling relations between the characteristic damping timescales (CDTs) of light curves and black hole mass offer valuable insights into the underlying physical structure of accretion disks. We investigate, for the first time, the long-term hard X-ray variability of black hole and neutron star accretion systems using light curves from the \textit{Swift} Burst Alert Telescope 157-month catalog. Applying a damped random walk model, we measure CDTs for 39 Seyfert galaxies, 17 blazars, 82 X-ray binaries, and one tidal disruption event. Unexpectedly, these CDTs span months to years but with a mass-independent feature, in contrast to well-established scaling laws. This puzzling phenomenon can be attributed to conductive timescales arising from disk--corona interactions, instead of the intrinsic accretion disk processes characterized by scaling laws, and it may further modulate jet emission in blazars. This result demonstrates thermal conduction as a key mechanism driving hard X-ray variability and offers new observational evidence for the disk--corona--jet connection.

 - **Abstract**
 The papers included in this Focus Point collection are devoted to the studies on the cosmological tensions and challenges stimulated by the latest observational data. The first results of the LARES-2 laser ranging satellite on the high precision testing of the frame-dragging effect predicted by General Relativity are presented. The data on the S-stars monitoring in the Galactic center obtained by GRAVITY collaboration were analysed within the Physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach. The results enabled to probe the role of the cosmological constant, of the dark matter, the star cluster in the core of the Galaxy obtaining an upper limit for the star density. The topics include the conversion of high-frequency relic gravitational waves into photons in cosmological magnetic field, cosmological gravitational waves stochastic background generation through the spontaneous breaking of a global baryon number symmetry, observational predictions of the Starobinsky inflation model and other studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave observations of massive, rapidly spinning binary black holes mergers provide increasing evidence for the dynamical origin of some mergers. Previous studies have interpreted the mergers with primary mass $\gtrsim45\,M_\odot$ as being dominated by hierarchical, second-generation mergers, with rapidly spinning primaries being the products of previous black hole mergers assembled in dense stellar clusters. In this work, we reveal confident evidence of another subpopulation with rapid and isotropic spins at low mass containing the two exceptional events GW241011 and GW241110, consistent with a hierarchical merger hypothesis. Our result suggests the mass distribution of the second-generation black holes is peaked at low primary masses of $\sim16\,M_\odot$ rather than $\gtrsim45\,M_\odot$ in the pair-instability gap. Such low-mass second-generation black holes must be formed from the merger of even lighter first-generation black holes, implying that dense, metal-rich stellar environments contribute to the binary black hole population. By separating the contamination of higher-generation black holes, our result reveals the primary mass distribution of first-generation black holes formed from stellar collapse, which shows a significant dip between $\sim12\,M_\odot$ to $\sim20\,M_\odot$. This may indicate a dearth of black holes due to variation in the core compactness of the progenitor.

#### Intensive X-ray/UVOIR continuum reverberation mapping of the Seyfert AGN MCG+08-11-11

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from intensive (x3 daily), three-month-long X-ray, UV and optical monitoring of the bright Seyfert active galactic nucleus (AGN) MCG+08-11-11 with Swift, supported by optical-infrared ground-based monitoring. The 12 resultant, well-sampled, lightcurves are highly correlated; in particular, the X-ray to UV correlation r_max = 0.85 is, as far as we know, the highest yet recorded in a Seyfert galaxy. The lags increase with wavelength, as expected from reprocessing of central high-energy emission by surrounding material. Our lag spectrum is much shallower than that obtained from an optical monitoring campaign conducted a year earlier when MCG+08-11-11 was approximately 4 times brighter. After filtering out long-term trends in the earlier optical lightcurves we recover shorter lags consistent with our own - demonstrating concurrent reverberation signals from different spatial scales and the luminosity dependence of the measured lags. We use our lag spectrum to test several physical models, finding that disc reprocessing models cannot account for the observed 'excess' lags in the u and r-i-bands that are highly indicative of the Balmer and Paschen continua produced by reprocessing in the broad line region (BLR) gas. The structure seen in both the variable (rms) and lag spectra, and the large time delay between X-ray and UV variations (approximately 2 days) all suggest that the BLR is the dominant reprocessor. The hard X-ray spectrum (Gamma approximately 1.7) and faint, red, UV-optical spectrum both indicate that the Eddington accretion ratio is low: approximately 0.03. The bolometric luminosity then requires that the black hole mass is substantially greater than current reverberation mapping derived estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 Several gamma ray bursts have recently been associated with a kilonova emission. We study the mechanisms which could account for this effect, by means of radioactive decay of elements synthesized in accretion disk wind. We model the r-process nucleosynthesis in the accretion disk wind system, asscociated with the prompt GRB phase. We compute the time-dependent GR MHD evolution of a GRB central engine where the newly formed black hole is accreting the mass from post-merger remnant. We explore the wind properties, for a range of the initial parameters of the system, and study representative cases for compact binary merger progenitors. We compute a suite of 2D and 3D time-dependent General Relativistic numerical simulations with a tabulated 3-parameter equation of state that allows for evolution of chemical composition evolution of the accretion flow. The neutrino emission is accounted for by incorporating the leakage scheme, where neutrino optical depth is calculated along the radial rays. We parameterize the optically thick and thin tori with different values of the pressure maximum and entropy in the disk, while the strength of large-scale poloidal magnetic fields is parameterized according to the chosen gas-to-magnetic pressure ratio. To probe the winds, we follow the particle trajectories. Upon this, we derive the nucleosynthetic yields of heavy elements in the outflows, and we map the regions of Lanthanide rich and poor ejecta. We find that the outflow carries high mass of neutron rich material expanding with mildly relativistic velocities. Our accretion disks operating under the SANE mode can power the GRB jets via neutrino annihilation, if the disk to BH mass ratio is larger than about 0.01 and the black hole is spinning. Slowly spinning black holes surrounded by massive post-merger disks can power these jets, and also be the sites of efficient nucleosynthesis of Lanthanides.

#### Non-Interacting New Agegraphic Dark Energy Model in $f(Q)$ Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we explore the reconstruction of a new agegraphic dark energy model in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime by $f(Q)$ gravity framework, where $Q$ represents non-metricity. We assume that the scale factor follows a power-law and explore how this model aligns with the expanding universe. In this perspective, we develop a new agegraphic $f(Q)$ model and analyze the graphical behavior for cosmic evolution. We analyze physical characteristics of the model using the equation of state parameter, $(\omega_{D}-\omega^{\prime}_{D})$ and the $(r-s)$ planes. The equation of state parameter indicates a quintessence era characterized by accelerated expansion. The $(\omega_{D}-\omega^{\prime}_{D})$-plane identifies the freezing region and the Chaplygin gas model is represented in the $(r-s)$-plane. Finally, we examine the stability of the non-interacting model by evaluating the squared speed of sound. Our findings show that the non-interacting new agegraphic dark energy model effectively resolves the cosmic coincidence problem.

 - **Abstract**
 Applications of effective field theory (EFT) and scattering amplitudes to gravitational problems have recently produced many unique results that advanced our understanding of the dynamics of compact binaries. Many of these results were made possible by comparing gravitational scattering amplitudes in EFT with exact expressions from general relativity. However, the latter expressions are not easily available as they require intricate solution techniques for the Teukolsky master equation, such as the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) method. In this paper, we develop and present the first public package that enables computations of gravitational scattering amplitudes in black hole perturbation theory within the MST framework. Our package supports both analytic computations to a given post-Minkowskian (PM) order in the low-frequency limit and exact numerical computations for an arbitrary frequency of the perturbing field. As an application, we compute scattering phase shifts and inelasticity parameters for massless spin - 0, 1, and 2 fields resulting from scattering off a rotating Kerr black hole through the third PM order and compare these results with the exact numerical solutions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new class of expanding and twisting solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations of algebraic type D, where the null eigendirections of the Faraday tensor are not aligned with PNDs of the Weyl tensor. After deriving this novel solution, we explore its various metric forms and parameterizations. In suitable coordinates, the solution depends on six physical parameters, namely mass $m$, Kerr and NUT twist parameters $a$ and $l$, complex charge $c$, acceleration $\alpha$, and parameter $\beta$ that governs the interplay between electric and magnetic charges in the aligned part of the Faraday tensor. This parameterization, as the Griffiths-Podolský form of the Plebański-Demiański solution, facilitates explicit special subcases, such as Kerr-Newman black holes, and a deeper physical interpretation. Additionally, in the static limit, our solution reduces to previously known cases.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) represent one of the more interesting ways to address dark matter, at the interface of both cosmology and quantum gravity. It is no surprise then that testing PBHs is a venue of active interest, with several cosmological and astrophysical probes constraining different mass ranges. In this work, we propose novel Solar System scale searches for PBHs, motivated by the unique precision and coverage of local observables. We show that asteroid to dwarf planet mass PBHs can induce measurable dipolar timing signatures in pulsar timing arrays, while planetary mass PBHs can generate detectable ADAF accretion flares through interactions with Kuiper Belt bodies. Together, these complementary approaches open a new observational frontier for probing PBHs across mass ranges that remain unconstrained by conventional cosmological methods.

 - **Abstract**
 The two-parameter inhomogeneous and time-dependent Pimentel solution of Brans-Dicke theory is analyzed to probe the new thermal view in which General Relativity is the zero-temperature (equilibrium) state of scalar-tensor gravity. As the parameters vary, we uncover phenomenology not found before with other exact solutions, nor contemplated thus far in the general theory. In the process, we also discuss the anomalous limit to General Relativity of the Pimentel geometry and show how the Mars solution of the Einstein equations is its Einstein frame version.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a fully covariant and gauge-invariant analysis of linear cosmological perturbations in Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity. Working within the 1+3 formalism, we derive the exact propagation equations for scalar, vector, and tensor modes on FLRW backgrounds, in the case of radiation and dust. Two representative subclasses are examined in detail, in which non-linearity enters through $\mathcal{O}(\eta\rho^2)$ corrections or modifications in the equation-of-state parameter and the sound speed. For scalar perturbations, the density contrast can be enhanced or reduced relative to General Relativity, depending on the coupling parameter and the wavelength regime. A similar behaviour occurs for vector modes, allowing for a non-trivial vorticity at early-times. Tensor modes, described by the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor and the shear tensor propagate as damped waves with slowly varying effective masses. All sectors reduce continuously to their GR limits as $\eta\!\to\!0$. The framework isolates robust signatures - early-time scalar tilts, tensor damping shifts, and altered vorticity decay - that can be confronted with CMB and large-scale-structure observations to constrain these theories of gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 Born-Infeld electrogravity is defined through a Lagrangian that couples gravity and electromagnetism within a single determinantal structure. The field equations are derived in Palatini's formalism, where the metric, connection, and vector potential are varied independently in the action. As a result, the gravitational sector reduces to Einstein's equations with a torsion-free, metric-compatible connection. The electrodynamic sector, in turn, admits two equivalent interpretations or $pictures$: it can be seen either as a standard Born-Infeld electrodynamics in an effective background geometry, or as an $anomalous$ Born-Infeld electrodynamics in the physical metric. We illustrate the dynamics by analyzing the horizon structure and extremality conditions of spherically symmetric dyonic solutions. A comparison with the Reissner-Nordström geometry shows that Born-Infeld electrogravity softens but does not eliminate curvature divergences, and geodesic incompleteness persists.

 - **Abstract**
 The linear stability of two exact stationary solutions of the parametrically driven, damped nonlinear Dirac equation is investigated. Stability is ascertained through the resolution of the eigenvalue problem, which stems from the linearization of this equation around the exact solutions. On the one hand, it is proven that one of these solutions is always unstable, which confirms previous analysis based on a variational method. On the other hand, it is shown that sufficiently large dissipation guarantees the stability of the second solution. Specifically, we determine the stability curve that separates stable and unstable regions in the parameter space. The dependence of the stability diagram on the driven frequency is also studied, and it is shown that low-frequency solitons are stable across the entire parameter space. These results have been corroborated with extensive simulations of the parametrically driven and damped nonlinear Dirac equation by employing a novel and recently proposed numerical algorithm that minimizes discretization errors.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we investigate the proposed duality between the island and the defect extremal surface (DES) prescriptions using the fine-grained entanglement entropy in Karch-Randall (KR) brane-world models with gravitating radiation baths. We consider the AdS$_3$ black string geometry and compute the entanglement entropy for radiation subsystems on an AdS$_2$ eternal black hole background using both the island and the DES prescriptions. We find an agreement between the two proposals for the island and the no-island phases, thus verifying the validity of the proposed duality. We further extend to a $T\bar{T}$ deformed AdS$_3$ black string geometry with a cut-off and find consistent results for both phases. We finally plot and compare the Page curves for the undeformed and deformed scenarios, and discuss the modifications due to $T\bar{T}$ deformation.

 - **Abstract**
 Extending the single-angular-momentum case analyzed in our previous work, we investigate the solution-generating technique based on the Breitenlohner-Maison (BM) linear system for asymptotically flat, stationary, bi-axisymmetric black hole solutions with two angular momenta in five-dimensional vacuum Einstein theory. In particular, we construct the monodromy matrix associated with the BM linear system for the doubly rotating Myers-Perry black holes and the Pomeransky-Sen'kov black rings. Conversely, by solving the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem using the procedure developed by Katsimpouri et al., we demonstrate that the factorization of the monodromy matrix precisely reproduces these vacuum solutions, thereby reconstructing both geometries.

 - **Abstract**
 The quantum induced stress tensor of 3+1-dimensional Einstein gravity, with conformally coupled matter, is studied in an effective field theory approach. In this context, Riegert's non-local effective action is sufficient to reproduce the trace anomaly in curved spacetime but in general the effective action can include additional non-local but scale invariant terms that influence the semiclassical physics without affecting the trace anomaly. Here, a truncated model, with only one additional term involving the square of the Weyl tensor, is used to find the induced stress tensor in a black hole background. With suitable physical conditions, a solution of the resulting 4th order equations leads, in a static limit, to a unique quantum state matching expected properties of the Unruh state.

 - **Abstract**
 Leveraging the computational framework presented in reference [JHEP 07, 062 (2024)], we evaluate the analytic scattering waveform in General Relativity to second order, $G^3 M^3 /r b^2$ and to all orders in velocity. This new representation of the next-to-leading order waveform is well-suited for numerical evaluation. Integrating the [modulus square of the] waveform over the angles on the celestial sphere, we also compute the power spectrum of the radiation to order $G^4$ numerically.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a resolution to the longstanding problem of perturbative normalizability in canonical quantum gravity of the Lorentzian Chern-Simons-Kodama (CSK) state with a positive cosmological constant in four dimensions. While the CSK state is an exact solution to the Hamiltonian constraint in the self-dual formulation and semiclassically describes de Sitter spacetime, its physical viability has been questioned due to apparent nonnormalizability and CPT asymmetry. Starting from a nonperturbative holomorphic inner product derived from the reality conditions of the self-dual Ashtekar variables, we show that the linearization, in terms of gravitons, of the CSK state is perturbatively normalizable for super-Planckian cosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a rotation in phase space, a generalization of Thiemann's complexifier, can render the full perturbative state normalizable for all $\Lambda$ by analytically continuing the non-convergent modes in phase space. This provides the first concrete realization of a CPT-breaking, yet normalizable, gravitational vacuum state rooted in a nonperturbative quantum gravity framework. Our results establish the CSK state-long thought formal-as a viable candidate for the ground state of quantum gravity in de Sitter space.
