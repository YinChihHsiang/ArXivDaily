 - **Abstract**
 We present a global three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation of a circumbinary disk (CBD) around a massive black hole binary (MBHB) with a total mass $2 \times 10^7\,M_{\odot}$ and mass ratio $0.1$, separated by $100\, GM_{\rm tot}/c^2$. The inclusion of radiation makes the disk thinner, denser, less eccentric at the inner edge, and more filamentary when compared to an otherwise identical locally isothermal MHD disk. The RMHD disk has accretion rate $\sim 0.23\,\dot{M}_{\mathrm{Edd}}$ and produces thermal emission peaking in the near-UV/optical with a luminosity of $\sim 1\, \% L_{\rm {Edd }}$. Compared with an equal-mass binary with the same total mass, the thermal emission of the CBD around the unequal-mass binary is several orders of magnitude brighter and much more variable at far-UV/soft X-rays frequencies. Similarly, we find that the light curve associated with the $0.1$ mass ratio binary exhibits dominant periodicity corresponding to 2 binary orbits, compared to the equal-mass binary that shows periodicity at 2.5-5 binary orbits. Our results highlight the importance of radiation for the structure and observational properties of MBHB circumbinary disks and have implications for detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LISA gravitational wave precursors and for the heavier binaries targeted by the Pulsar Timing Arrays.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we forecast the number of, and requirements on, N-body simulations needed to train hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) emulators for a range of use cases, using a hybrid of HMcode and perturbation theory as a surrogate model. Our accuracy goals, determined with careful consideration of statistical and systematic uncertainties, are $1\%$ accurate in the high-likelihood range of cosmological parameters, and $2\%$ accurate over a broader parameter space volume for $k<1 h Mpc^{-1}$ and $z<3$. Focusing in part on the 8-parameter $w_0w_a$CDM+$m_\nu$ cosmological model, we find that $<225$ simulations are required to meet our error goals over our wide parameter space, including models with rapidly evolving dark energy, given our simulation and emulator recommendations. For a more restricted parameter space volume, as few as 80 simulations are sufficient. We additionally present simulation forecasts for example use cases, and make the code used in our analyses publicly available. These results offer practical guidance for efficient emulator design and simulation budgeting in future cosmological analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the $z=0$ results for the cosmological simulation ASTRID. Hosting $2\times 5500^3\approx$ 0.33 trillion particles in a box of $370\, {\rm Mpc}$ per side, ASTRID is one of the largest cosmological hydrodynamic simulations evolved to $z=0$. ASTRID features a large population of massive black holes (MBHs), covering a wide mass range $4\times10^{4}\sim 2\times 10^{11}\ M_{\odot}$. The adopted dynamical friction model provides a relatively accurate description of MBH dynamics, making ASTRID a powerful tool to study MBH growth and mergers in a cosmological context. ASTRID successfully captures the co-evolution of MBHs and their host galaxies, producing $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\star}$ and $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ relations in good agreement with observations. Notably, ASTRID generates scatter in these relations that is more consistent with observations than previous simulations, indicating a more realistic MBH diversity. The galaxy stellar mass function at $z=0$ is generally consistent with observational constraints. When dust attenuation is applied, the galaxy luminosity function also agrees well with observations, and the bimodality in galaxy colors is reproduced as well. ASTRID hosts a large population of massive galaxy groups and clusters: 7 halos have $M_{\rm 200c}>10^{15}\ M_{\odot}$, and 9709 halos have $M_{\rm 200c}>10^{13}\ M_{\odot}$. We quantify the stellar mass content in these halos, and find that the correlations between the stellar and halo mass match well with observational constraints. Finally, we present the $z=0$ power spectra of MBH and galaxies, as well as their bias with respect to the matter power spectrum. We find that MBHs with $M_{\rm BH}\geq 10^{8}\ M_{\odot}$ and galaxies with $M_{\star}\geq 10^{10.5}\ M_{\odot}$ serve as good tracers of large-scale structure.

 - **Abstract**
 IGR J17091-3624 is the only black hole X-ray binary candidate, aside from the well-studied black hole system GRS 1915+105, observed to exhibit a wide range of structured variability patterns in its light curves. In 2025, the source underwent a ``failed'' outburst: it brightened in the hard state but did not transition to the soft state before returning to quiescence within a few weeks. During this period, IGR J17091-3624 was observed by multiple ground- and space-based facilities. Here, we present results from six pointed NuSTAR observations obtained during the outburst. None of the NuSTAR light curves showed the exotic variability classes typical of the soft state in this source; however, we detected, for the first time, strong dips in the count rate during one epoch, with a total duration of $\sim4\,\mathrm{ks}$ as seen by NuSTAR. Through spectral and timing analysis of all six epochs, we investigate the hard-state spectral evolution and the nature of the dips. A clear evolution of the coronal properties with luminosity is observed over all six epochs, with clear signatures of relativistic disk reflection which remain largely unchanged across the first five epochs. The first five epochs also show a strong and stable quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) feature in the power spectra. The dips observed in Epoch 5 are consistent with partial obscuration by ionized material with a column density $N_{\mathrm{H}} \approx 2.0 \times 10^{23}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. We discuss possible origins for this material and place constraints on the orbital parameters and distance of the system.

#### Probing cosmic velocities with the pairwise kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal in DESI Bright Galaxy Sample DR1 and ACT DR6

 - **Abstract**
 We present a measurement of the pairwise kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) signal using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS) Data Release 1 (DR1) galaxy sample overlapping with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) CMB temperature map. Our analysis makes use of $1.6$ million galaxies with stellar masses $\log M_\star/M_\odot > 10$, and we explore measurements across a range of aperture sizes ($2.1' < \theta_{\rm ap} < 3.5'$) and stellar mass selections. This statistic directly probes the velocity field of the large-scale structure, a unique observable of cosmic dynamics and modified gravity. In particular, at low redshifts, this quantity is especially interesting, as deviations from General Relativity are expected to be largest. Notably, our result represents the highest-significance low-redshift ($z \sim 0.3$) detection of the kSZ pairwise effect yet. In our most optimal configuration ($\theta_{\rm ap} = 3.3'$, $\log M_\star > 11$), we achieve a $5\sigma$ detection. Assuming that an estimate of the optical depth and galaxy bias of the sample exists via e.g., external observables, this measurement constrains the fundamental cosmological combination $H_0 f \sigma_8^2$. A key challenge is the degeneracy with the galaxy optical depth. We address this by combining CMB lensing, which allows us to infer the halo mass and galaxy population properties, with hydrodynamical simulation estimates of the mean optical depth, $\bar \tau$. We stress that this is a proof-of-concept analysis; with BGS DR2 data we expect to improve the statistical precision by roughly a factor of two, paving the way toward robust tests of modified gravity with kSZ-informed velocity-field measurements at low redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 Optical quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with periodicity around hundreds to thousands of days have been accepted as an efficient indicator for sub-pc binary black hole systems (BBHs) in broad line active galactic nuclei (BLAGN). However, considering intrinsic variability (red noises) of BLAGN, it is still an open question on physical origin of detected optical QPOs from AGN variability or truly from sub-pc BBHs. Here, a simple method is proposed to support optical QPOs related to sub-pc BBHs by detecting QPOs in time dependent optical color evolutions of BLAGN. Periodic variations of obscurations are expected on optical light curves related to sub-pc BBHs, but there should be non-periodic variable obscurations on optical light curves in normal BLAGN. Through simulated optical light curves for intrinsic AGN variability by Continuous AutoRegressive process with time durations around 2800days (similar as time durations of light curves in ZTF), the probability is definitely smaller than $3.3\times10^{-7}$ that QPOs can be detected in the corresponding optical color evolutions, but about $3.1\times10^{-2}$ that optical QPOs with periodicity smaller than 1400days (at least two cycles) can be detected in the simulated single-band light curves. Therefore, confidence level is definitely higher than 5$\sigma$ to support the QPOs in color evolutions not related to intrinsic AGN variability but truly related to sub-pc BBHs. In the near future, the proposed method can be applied for searching reliable optical QPOs in BLAGN through multi-band light curves from the ZTF and the upcoming LSST.

 - **Abstract**
 Star-forming activity in the host galaxies of high-redshift quasars is crucial to understanding the connection between supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity and galaxy evolution. While most existing studies are biased toward luminous quasars, we conduct carbon monoxide (CO) observations of 17 gravitationally lensed quasars that have four images using the IRAM 30m telescope to investigate the molecular gas content of moderate- to low-luminosity quasars. CO emissions are detected in five out of 17 quasars, corresponding to a detection rate of about 30\%. Analysis of their star formation activity reveals that these quasars live in gas-rich environments but exhibit weaker starbursts and lower star formation efficiencies compared to other luminous high-redshift quasars. In addition, the CO spectral line energy distributions of the two quasars (SDSS J0924+0219, SDSS J1330+1810) are also consistent with mild star formation instead of extreme starbursts. These results suggest that these lensed quasars reside in weaker starburst environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The binary black hole merger GW231123 is both the most massive gravitational-wave event observed and has the highest component spins measured to date. The dimensionless spins of the more massive (primary) and less massive (secondary) black holes are measured to be $\chi_1 = 0.90^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $\chi_2 = 0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$ ($90\%$ credible intervals), respectively. Its large mass and extremal spins are challenging to explain through standard binary stellar physics, though a flurry of hypothetical scenarios have been proposed. Hierarchical assembly -- i.e., mergers of black holes that are themselves formed from previous generations of mergers -- is generally a promising way to explain massive and rapidly spinning black holes. Here, we investigate the possibility that both GW231123 was assembled hierarchically in a dense star cluster as the merger of two second-generation black holes. Taking the inferred spin values at face value, we find that it is possible, though unlikely ($p\lesssim 1\%$), that a compact binary with both component spins like GW231123 could form in a cluster from hierarchical assembly.

 - **Abstract**
 Hubble constant tension, together with the recent indications of dynamical dark energy proposed from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, poses significant challenges to the standard cosmological model. In this work, we perform a model-independent reconstruction of the dark-energy equation of state $w(z)$, jointly with an evolving Hubble constant $H_0(z)$. Using the DESI DR2 data combined with multiple type Ia supernova samples, we find that $w(z)$ varies with redshift and exhibits two potential phantom crossings at $z\sim0.5$ and $z\sim1.5$. Meanwhile, $H_0$ decreases continually from local to high redshift, alleviating the Hubble constant tension effectively. The joint $w(z)$-$H_0(z)$ model is strongly favored over the $w$CDM ($\Lambda$CDM) framework, with a logarithmic Bayes factor $\ln \boldsymbol{\mathcal B}= 5.04~(8.53)$. Across various prior assumptions and dataset combinations, we obtain consistent, data-driven reconstructions of both $w(z)$ and $H_0(z)$. Future BAO measurements from Euclid and next-generation CMB experiments will provide critical tests of these results and bring deeper insights into the nature of dark energy and the evolution of cosmic expansion.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the potential improvements in constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ and matter density $\Omega_M$ from using clustering information along with number counts for future samples of thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich selected galaxy clusters. We quantify the relative improvement from including the clustering power spectrum information for three cluster sample sizes from 33,000 to 140,000 clusters and for three assumed priors on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable relation. As expected, clustering information has the largest impact when (i) there are more clusters and (ii) the mass-observable priors are weaker. For current knowledge of the cluster mass-observable relationship, we find the addition of clustering information reduces the uncertainty on the dark energy equation of state, $\sigma(w)$, by factors of $1.023\pm 0.007$ to $1.0790\pm 0.011$, with larger improvements observed with more clusters. Clustering information is more important for the matter density, with $\sigma(\Omega_M)$ reduced by factors of $1.068 \pm 007$ to $1.145 \pm 0.012$. The improvement in $w$ constraints from adding clustering information largely vanishes after tightening priors on the mass-observable relationship by a factor of two. For weaker priors, we find clustering information improves the determination of the cluster mass slope and redshift evolution by factors of $1.389 \pm 0.041$ and $1.340 \pm 0.039$ respectively. These findings highlight that, with the anticipated surge in cluster detections from next generation surveys, self-calibration through clustering information will provide an independent cross-check on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable relationship as well as enhancing the precision achievable from cluster cosmology.

#### The variability of active galaxies: I. Broad-band noise X-ray power spectra from XMM-Newton and Swift

 - **Abstract**
 Accreting supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies are the engine of active galactic nuclei (AGN). X-ray light curves of unabsorbed AGN show dramatic random variability on timescales ranging from seconds to years. The power spectrum of the fluctuations is usually well-modelled with a power law that decays as $1/f$ at low frequencies, and which bends to $1/f^{2-3}$ at high frequencies. The timescale associated with the bend correlates well with the mass of the black hole and may also correlate with bolometric luminosity in the `X-ray variability plane'. Because AGN light curves are usually irregularly sampled, the estimation of AGN power spectra is challenging. In a previous paper, we introduced a new method to estimate the parameters of bending power law power spectra from AGN light curves. We apply this method to a sample of 56 variable and unabsorbed AGN, observed with XMM-Newton and Swift in the $0.3-1.5$ keV band over the past two decades. We obtain estimates of the bends in 50 sources, which is the largest sample of X-ray bends in the soft band. We also find that the high-frequency power spectrum is often steeper than 2. We update the X-ray variability plane with new bend timescale measurements spanning from 7 min to 62 days. We report the detections of low-frequency bends in the power spectra of five AGN, three of which are previously unpublished: 1H 1934-063, Mkn 766 and Mkn 279.

 - **Abstract**
 We use the Horizon-AGN cosmological simulation to study the properties of supermassive black hole binaries (MBHBs) contributing most to the gravitational wave background (GWB) signal expected in the pulsar timing array (PTA) band. We develop a pipeline to generate realistic populations of MBHBs, allowing us to estimate both the characteristic strain and GWB time series observable by PTA experiments. We identify potential continuous wave (CW) candidates standing above the background noise, using toy PTA sensitivities representing the current EPTA and future SKA. We estimate the probability of detecting at least one CW with signal-to-noise ratio $>3$ to be $4\%$ ($20\%$) for EPTA (SKA)-like sensitivities, assuming a 10-year baseline. We find the GWB to be dominated by hundreds to thousands of binaries at redshifts in the range $0.05-1$, with chirp masses of $10^{8.5}-10^{9.5}\, M_\odot$, hosted mainly in quiescent massive galaxies residing in halos of mass $\sim 10^{13}\, M_\odot$. CW candidates have larger masses, lower redshifts and are found in even more massive halos, typical of galaxy groups and clusters. The majority of these systems would appear as AGN rather than quasars, because of their low Eddington ratios. Nevertheless, CW candidates with $f_{\rm Edd}>10^{-3}$ can still outshine their hosts, particularly in radio and X-ray bands, suggesting them as the most promising route for identification. Our findings imply that optical and near-infrared searches based on light curve variability are challenging and biased toward more luminous systems. Finally, we highlight important caveats in the common method used to compare PTA observations with theoretical models. We find that GWB spectral inferences used by PTAs could be biased toward shallower slopes and higher amplitudes at $f=1/\rm yr$, thereby reducing the apparent tension between astrophysical expectations and PTA observations.

#### Mergers lighting the early Universe: enhanced star formation, AGN triggering, and Ly$α$ emission in close pairs at $z=3-9$

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers and interactions are often invoked to explain enhanced star formation, black hole growth, and mass build-up of galaxies at later cosmic times, but their effect is poorly understood at high redshift ($z>2$). We use JADES data to analyse a mass-complete sample of 2095 galaxies at $z=3-9$ with ${\rm log}(M_\star/{\rm M_\odot}) = [8, 10]$, identifying major merger pairs (projected separation of $5-100$ pkpc, mass ratio $\geq 1/4$) using a probabilistic method. To look for signatures of enhancement in multiple physical properties, we carefully build a control sample of non-pairs that are simultaneously matched in redshift, stellar mass, isolation, and environment to the pair sample. We find a moderate enhancement in specific star formation rate (sSFR) of $1.12 \pm 0.05$ at separations $\lesssim 20$ kpc, which is weakly detectable out to $\sim50$ kpc. We find that at longer averaging timescales (50-100 Myr) the sSFR is more affected by interactions and environment, whereas at shorter timescales (5-10 Myr) it is dominated by internal feedback and burstiness. By averaging star formation histories, we find two distinct populations: pre-first passage/coalescence (monotonically rising SFR) and post-pericentre pairs (earlier peak in SFR). Finally, we find no significant excess of AGN in pairs, suggesting galaxy interactions are not effectively triggering black hole activity at separations $>5$ kpc. Similarly, we also do not detect an excess in the fraction of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters in pairs, implying that at the probed separations, galaxy interactions are not efficient at enhancing Lyman-$\alpha$ photon production and escape, which may only become important at the smallest scales.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy enables dynamical mass measurements for typical star-forming galaxies only a billion years after the Big Bang. We model the H$\alpha$ morpho-kinematics of 163 galaxies at redshift $z\approx4$-6 from FRESCO and CONGRESS (with JADES imaging), using the $\texttt{geko}$ code, and infer rotational velocities and dispersions within $r_{\rm e}$. Our sample spans $\log M_{\star}\approx7$-10 and $\log M_{\rm dyn}\approx9$-11. Gas masses are estimated via scaling relations, yielding baryonic masses and dark-matter (DM) fractions $f_{\rm DM}(r<r_{\rm e})$ within the H$\alpha$ half-light radius. We find high median fractions of $\langle f_{\rm gas}\rangle=0.77$ and $\langle f_{\rm DM}\rangle=0.73$, where $f_{\rm gas}$ is measured with respect to the baryonic mass and $f_{\rm DM}$ with respect to the DM+baryonic mass. About two-thirds of systems are DM-dominated within $r_{\rm e}\sim0.5-1$ kpc. Both $f_{\rm gas}$ and $f_{\rm DM}$ decrease with stellar mass, consistent with simulations. The stellar Tully-Fisher relation shows a tentative offset to higher $v_{\rm circ}$ at fixed $M_{\star}$ and substantial intrinsic scatter, suggesting that the relation is only beginning to emerge at $z\sim5$. We measure a negative correlation between $f_{\rm DM}$ and baryonic surface density $\Sigma_{\rm bar}$, weaker but broadly consistent with trends at cosmic noon and at $z\sim0$. Qualitatively comparing with modified NFW profiles coupled to an empirical stellar-to-halo mass relation suggests that the lowest $f_{\rm DM}$ ($\lesssim0.4$) require cored inner DM profiles, while the highest fractions favour cuspier profiles, potentially reflecting adiabatic contraction. Overall, the elevated $f_{\rm gas}$ and $f_{\rm DM}$ at $z\gtrsim4$ are compatible with progenitors of baryon-dominated systems at $z\sim2$ and naturally anticipate overmassive black holes at fixed $M_{\star}$.

 - **Abstract**
 The rich phenomenology of binary neutron star mergers offers a unique opportunity to test general relativity, investigate matter at supranuclear densities, and learn more about the origin of heavy elements. As multi-messenger sources, they emit both gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation across several frequency bands. The interpretation of these signals relies heavily on accurate numerical-relativity simulations that incorporate the relevant microphysical processes. Using the latest updates of the BAM code, we perform general-relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star mergers with two different spin configurations. We adopt a state-of-the-art equation of state based on relativistic mean-field theory developed for dense matter in neutron star mergers. To capture both dynamical ejecta and secular outflows from magnetic and neutrino-driven winds, we evolve the systems up to $\sim 100\ \rm ms$ after the merger at considerably high resolution with a grid spacing of $\Delta x \approx 93\ \rm m$ across the neutron stars. Our results show that the non-spinning configuration undergoes a more violent merger, producing more ejecta with lower electron fraction and higher velocities, while the spinning configuration forms a larger disk due to its higher angular momentum. Although the initial magnetic field amplification within $\lesssim 10\ \rm ms$ after merger is similar in both systems, the non-spinning system reaches stronger magnetic fields and higher energies at later times. For a detailed view of the multi-messenger observables, we extract the gravitational-wave signal and compute nucleosynthesis yields, the expected kilonova and afterglow light curves from our ejecta profiles.

 - **Abstract**
 The 21-cm signal is a powerful probe of the early Universe's thermal history and could provide a unique avenue for constraining exotic physics. Previous studies have forecasted stringent constraints on energy injections from exotic sources that heat, excite, and ionize the background gas and thereby modify the 21-cm signal. In this work, we quantify the substantial impact that astrophysical uncertainties have on the projected sensitivity to exotic energy injection. In particular, there are significant uncertainties in the minimum star-forming dark matter halo mass, the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, and the X-ray emission, whose values characterize the fiducial astrophysical model when projecting bounds. As a case study, we investigate the energy injection of accreting primordial black holes of mass $\sim 1~M_\odot-10^3~M_\odot$, also taking into account uncertainties in the accretion model. We show that, depending on the chosen fiducial model and accretion uncertainties, the sensitivity of future 21-cm data could constrain the abundance of primordial black holes to be either slightly stronger, or significantly weaker, than current limits from the Cosmic Microwave Background.

 - **Abstract**
 GRB 230307A is one of the brightest long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) ever detected, yet its progenitor remains uncertain due to the variety of plausible astrophysical scenarios. In this work, we investigate four possible progenitors for GRB 230307A: a binary neutron star (BNS), a neutron star--white dwarf (NS--WD) system, a neutron star--black hole (NS--BH) merger, and a tidal disruption event (TDE) involving a white dwarf and a supermassive black hole. Additionally, we explore three distinct central engine models powering the kilonova associated with the BNS: radioactive decay of $r$-process nuclei in a two-component ejecta model, a magnetar-driven model including magnetic dipole spin-down, and a combined model of magnetar spin-down with ${}^{56}$Ni radioactive decay. We perform Bayesian multi-wavelength light-curve analyses using physically motivated models and priors, and evaluate model performance through Bayes factors and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) scores. Our results show a statistical preference for a BNS or NS--WD progenitor producing a kilonova powered by a magnetar and ${}^{56}$Ni decay, characterized by a ${}^{56}$Ni mass of $\sim4\times10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ and an ejecta mass of $0.06\,M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, under the assumption of a BNS origin within this model, we infer binary component masses of $m_{1} = 1.81^{+0.46}_{-0.61}\,M_{\odot}$ and $m_{2} = 1.61^{+0.65}_{-0.41}\,M_{\odot}$, with a dimensionless tidal deformability of $\tilde{\Lambda} = 471^{+318}_{-395}$. From the component mass posteriors, we infer that the observed offset can be explained by a natal kick as long as the systemic velocity is nearly aligned with the pre-kick orbital motion. In this case, the required kick velocity (co-moving frame) and binary separation range within $v'_{\mathrm{k}}\sim100$--$150~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, and $a_0\sim2$--$3~R_{\odot}$, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Upcoming galaxy surveys will bring a wealth of information about the clustering of matter, but modeling small-scale structure beyond $\Lambda$CDM remains computationally challenging. While accurate $N$-body emulators exist to model the matter power spectrum for $\Lambda$CDM and some limited extensions, it's unfeasible to generate $N$-body simulation suites for all candidate models. Motivated by recent hints of an evolving dark energy equation of state, we assess the viability of employing the COmoving Lagrangian Acceleration (COLA) method to generate simulation suites for the $w_0w_a$ dark energy model. We combine COLA simulations with an existing high-precision $\Lambda$CDM emulator to extend its predictions into new regions of parameter space. We assess the precision of our emulator at the level of the matter power spectrum, finding that our emulator can reproduce the nonlinear boosts from EuclidEmulator2 at less than $2\%$ error. Moreover, we perform an analysis of a simulated cosmic shear survey akin to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) first year of observations, assessing the differences in parameter constraints between our COLA-based emulator and the benchmark emulator. We find our emulator to be in excellent agreement with the benchmark, achieving less than $0.3\sigma$ shifts in cosmological parameters. We compare our emulator's performance to a commonly used approach: assuming the $\Lambda$CDM boost can be employed for extended parameter spaces without modification. We find that our emulator yields a significantly smaller $\Delta\chi^2$ distribution, parameter constraint biases, and a more accurate figure of merit compared to this second approach. Our results demonstrate that COLA emulators provide a computationally efficient path forward for modeling nonlinear structure in extended cosmologies, offering a practical alternative to full $N$-body suites.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze a model of quintessence governed by an exponential potential and non-minimally coupled to gravity, in light of recent datasets, including cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations, and supernovae distance moduli observations. Mainly focusing on the Palatini formulation of gravity, a phase space analysis reveals the existence of a late-time stable de Sitter attractor as long as the non-minimal coupling constant is negative, regardless of the value of the slope of the exponential. Fitting to CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we find strong evidence for our model over $\Lambda$CDM, with a Bayes factor $\log B = 5.52$. Furthermore, the data seem to prefer dynamical dark energy at $>3\sigma$ C.L. and a phantom crossing in the barotropic parameter of dark energy at $2-3\sigma$ C.L.. We find that the scalar field dynamics in the Palatini formalism provides marginally better agreement to the data compared to the metric formalism.

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova (SN) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measures have recently provided hints that the dark energy is not only dynamical but apparently evolves from normal to phantom dark energy between redshifts $0<z<1$. A normal axion dark energy component in the mass range just below the Hubble scale can mimic a phantom component by appearing as dark energy at $z=1$ and dark matter at $z=0$, raising the possibility of a phantom mirage. We show that there is a wide range of axion dark energy contributions that can resolve the SN-BAO tension as well as thawing quintessence does, leaving BAO tension with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) for the distance measures from $z\sim 1$ to recombination to be resolved at high redshifts. With axions, raising the optical depth to reionization to $\tau \approx 0.1$ works essentially as well as $w_0-w_a$ phantom dark energy for all but the lowE CMB data, with a remaining $\Delta\chi^2\sim -16$ compared with $\Lambda$CDM, whereas a small spatial curvature of $\Omega_K \sim 0.003$ can largely relax the full SN-BAO-CMB tension with a total $\Delta\chi^2 \sim -12$.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study the time evolution of radial kinks in the background of boson stars. In particular, we consider two types of boson stars: the massive boson star and the solitonic boson star. For each boson star, we study the dynamics of the kinks with four different compactnesses. We observe that the greater the compactness is, the slower the kinks move towards the origin of the boson stars, indicating that the compactness will hinder the kinks to collide with the origin. Additionally, it is found that when the boson star is highly compact, a new kink may turn out after the kink colliding with the origin, instead of immediately dissipating into the background. We then propose that the radial kinks may potentially serve as a means to probe the internal structures of dense astrophysical objects, even the interior structure of black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 The paper entitled Unimodular Gravity Traversable Wormholes by Agrawal et al. examined the properties of barotropic wormholes without tidal forces within the framework of Unimodular Gravity. Our analysis demonstrates that their conclusion regarding the possibility of sustaining such wormhole configurations with ordinary matter is not entirely accurate. We establish that exotic matter remains necessary for these wormhole solutions in Unimodular Gravity, in accordance with the long-established theoretical constraints already identified in General Relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 The geometric foundations of General Relativity are revisited, with particular attention to its gauge invariance, as a key to understanding the true nature of spacetime. Beyond the common image of spacetime as a deformable 'fabric' filling the Universe, curvature is interpreted as the dynamic interplay between matter and interacting fields; a view already emphasized by Einstein and Weyl, but sometimes overlooked in the literature. Building on these tools, a Newtonian framework is reconstructed that captures essential aspects of cosmology, showing how classical intuition can coexist with modern geometric insights. This perspective shifts the focus from substance to relationships, offering a fresh magnifying glass through which to reinterpret gravitational dynamics and the large-scale structure of the Universe. The similarities of this approach with other recent, more ambitious ones carried out at the quantum level are quite remarkable.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a fully Bayesian, data-driven framework for identifying quasinormal modes in high-accuracy Cauchy-Characteristic Evolution (CCE) gravitational waveforms. Applying this to a public catalog, we identify QNM overtones, retrograde modes, and nonlinear modes up to cubic order in the ringdown. The ringdown mode content is tabulated across a wide range of start times for all available simulations, providing a systematic reference for theoretical and observational studies. We also search for late-time power-law tails, which are, as expected, absent from the CCE waveforms.

 - **Abstract**
 With the upcoming third-generation gravitational-wave detectors comes the need to build complete, faithful, and fast waveform models for asymmetric-mass-ratio compact binaries. Most efforts within the self-force community have focused on modeling these binaries' inspiral regime, but for ground-based detectors the systems' final merger can represent the dominant part of the signal. Recent work by three of us has extended the multiscale self-force framework through the transition-to-plunge and merger-ringdown regimes for nonspinning binaries. In this paper, we generalize the next-to-next-to-leading-order transition-to-plunge waveform model to include the spin of the primary black hole. We also improve the construction of composite inspiral-transition waveform models by performing a change of variables on the binary's mechanical phase space during the transition to plunge. We provide detailed discussions of our numerical implementation and comparisons with numerical relativity simulations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the second release of the $\texttt{GR-Athena++}$ waveform catalog, comprising four new quasi-circular, non-precessing, spinning binary black hole simulations. These simulations are performed at high resolutions and represent a step toward generating high-fidelity gravitational waveforms that can eventually meet the accuracy requirements of upcoming next-generation detectors, including LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope. Gravitational waves are extracted at future null infinity ( $\mathscr{I}^{+}$) using both Cauchy characteristic extraction and finite-radius extraction. For each simulation, we provide strain data across multiple resolutions and analyze waveform accuracy via convergence studies and self-mismatch analyses. The absolute phase and relative amplitude differences reach their largest values near the merger, while the smallest errors are of order $\mathscr{O}(10^{-2})$ and $\mathscr{O}(10^{-3})$, respectively. A self-mismatch analysis of the dominant $(2,2)$ mode yields mismatches between $\mathscr{O}(10^{-5})$ and $\mathscr{O}(10^{-7})$ for a total binary mass of $10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$ over the frequency range $[0.002, 0.1]$ Hz using LISA noise curve. All waveforms are publicly available via $\texttt{ScholarSphere}$.

#### The Instability of the Critical Friedmann Spacetime at the Big Bang as an Alternative to Dark Energy

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14228

 - **Abstract**
 We characterize the local instability of pressureless Friedmann spacetimes to radial perturbation at the Big Bang. The analysis is based on a formulation of the Einstein-Euler equations in self-similar variables $(t,\xi)$, with $\xi=r/t$, conceived to realize the critical ($k=0$) Friedmann spacetime as a stationary solution whose character as an unstable saddle rest point $SM$ is determined via an expansion of smooth solutions in even powers of $\xi$. The eigenvalues of $SM$ imply the $k\neq0$ Friedmann spacetimes are unstable solutions within the unstable manifold of $SM$. We prove that all solutions smooth at the center of symmetry agree with a Friedmann spacetime at leading order in $\xi$, and with an eye toward Cosmology, we focus on $\mathcal{F}$, the set of solutions which agree with a $k<0$ Friedmann spacetime at leading order, providing the maximal family into which generic underdense radial perturbations of the unstable critical Friedmann spacetime will evolve. We prove solutions in $\mathcal{F}$ generically accelerate away from Friedmann spacetimes at intermediate times but decay back to the same leading order Friedmann spacetime asymptotically as $t\to\infty$. Thus instabilities inherent in the Einstein-Euler equations provide a natural mechanism for an accelerated expansion without recourse to a cosmological constant or dark energy.

#### A unified model of dark energy and inflation from the Markov-Mukhanov action

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14416

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a unified model of dark energy and inflation through the Markov-Mukhanov modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action, where the matter sector is coupled to gravity via a scalar coupling function depending only on the energy density of the matter content. We assume that the coupling function encodes the UV corrections to the standard model of cosmology and we determine the form of the coupling that allows for the dark energy component to be dynamical and act as the inflaton field in the early universe. Interestingly we show that our model, in order to account for inflation, prefers a dark energy equation of state with $w$ close but not equal to $-1$ in agreement with the latest DESI data.

 - **Abstract**
 Asymptotic Safety offers a conservative and predictive framework for quantum gravity, based on the existence of a renormalization group fixed point that ensures ultraviolet completeness without introducing new degrees of freedom. Black holes provide a natural arena in which to explore the implications of this scenario, as they probe the strongest gravitational fields and highlight the shortcomings of classical general relativity. In recent years, a variety of quantum-corrected black-hole solutions have been constructed within the Asymptotic Safety approach, either by renormalization-group improvement of classical metrics or through effective actions inspired by the flow of couplings. This review summarizes the current status of these developments. We discuss the structure and properties of the proposed solutions, their thermodynamics and evaporation, and their dynamical aspects such as quasinormal modes and shadows.

 - **Abstract**
 A variety of robust and effective descriptions have been devised to extract model-independent information about the fundamental properties of black holes from observational data when searching for deviations from general relativity. In this work, we construct explicit transformation maps establishing the equivalence among three relevant parametrizations for different spacetime patches: Johannsen-Psaltis, Rezzolla-Zhidenko, and Effective Metric Description. We then select representative black hole geometries to determine the minimal number of parameters required within each scheme to reproduce the associated quasi-normal mode spectra with a prescribed degree of accuracy. Our analysis shows that, for the given observables, a finite set of coefficients suffices to attain the desired precision in the three frameworks. Finally, we emphasize how the individual strengths of these effective descriptions can be exploited to probe complementary aspects of black hole physics.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we investigate asymptotically flat non-exotic traversable wormhole geometries within the King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter halos in the framework of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity. Two functional forms of the theory are considered: Model-I: $f(R, L_m)=(R/2) + L_m^{\alpha}$ and Model-II: $f(R, L_m)=(R/2) + (1 + \lambda R)L_m$. For both models, wormhole solutions are obtained and analyzed using the King and Dekel-Zhao dark matter density profiles, allowing us to explore how the underlying matter distribution influences the wormhole structures. The energy conditions are examined to verify the feasibility of sustaining the wormhole geometries with non-exotic matter, while embedding surfaces, proper radial distance, and total gravitational energy are studied to illustrate the wormhole's physical viability and traversability. Moreover, we test the strong deflection angle and its implications for gravitational lensing and show possible observational signatures of such wormhole configurations. Our results indicate that within $f(R, L_m)$ gravity, and for appropriate parameter choices, dark matter environments can sustain physically consistent non-exotic traversable wormhole geometries with distinct gravitational lensing signatures, providing new insights into the interplay between modified gravity, dark matter, and astrophysical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We establish a new no-go theorem for cosmology: spatially flat (k=0) and open (k=-1) Friedmann--Robertson--Walker (FRW) non-static spacetimes cannot be simultaneously nonsingular, geodesically complete, and consistent with the averaged null energy condition (ANEC). Equivalently, any dynamic flat or open universe that is complete must violate the ANEC. By contrast, closed universes (k=+1) uniquely admit nonsingular, geodesically complete, ANEC-consistent solutions, with global de Sitter space as the canonical realization that saturates the ANEC. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that positive spatial curvature naturally mimics the phenomenology of phantom dark energy (w<-1), biasing flat-model reconstructions of w(z) at the 1% level. These results sharpen the classical singularity theorems, establish a new classification of eternal cosmologies, and motivate renewed scrutiny of spatial curvature in both theory and observation.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that both abelian and non-abelian gauge theories admit configurations in which the fields behave as if in the presence of static charge densities, or ``shadow charges". These correspond to nontrivial initial conditions for the fields that generate gauge transformations, the Gauss' law operators. In non-abelian theories, such configurations seem to demand additional physical fields with exactly static charge densities. In contrast with this expectation, we show that gauge theory alone provides a consistent and gauge-invariant description of shadow charges. Canonical quantization then yields continuous shadow charges for abelian theories and quantized ones for non-abelian theories. In general, our findings indicate that all local conservation laws give rise to gauge symmetries, even in the presence of second-class constraints.
