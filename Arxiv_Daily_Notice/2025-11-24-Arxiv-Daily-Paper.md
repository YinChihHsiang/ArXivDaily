#### Pedagogic Null Tests of Dynamical Dark Energy Hints: Reconstructing LambdaCDM with Consistent BAO, CMB, and SNe Mocks

 - **Abstract**
 Hints of a dynamical dark-energy equation of state have appeared in several combined cosmological probes. However, such indications may instead arise from the intrinsic likelihood geometry of individual datasets, residual inter-probe tension, or restrictive priors. These factors can mimic evidence for dynamical dark energy. To clarify these issues, we perform a controlled null test. We use realistic mock BAO, CMB, and Type~Ia supernova datasets generated from a common fiducial LambdaCDM cosmology. These mocks include the DESI~DR2 BAO covariance, the Planck~2018 distance-prior covariance, and the full Pantheon+ SH0ES supernova covariance. This setup isolates physical information from geometric or statistical effects in the CPL parametrization. We find that individual probes and most two-probe combinations show apparent deviations in the (w0,wa) plane. These could be mistaken for phantom crossing or evolving dark energy. Two-probe combinations including supernovae (BAO+SNe, CMB+SNe) recover values near (w0,wa)=(-1,0) but fail to reconstruct (Omegam0,H0), because SNe do not determine the absolute distance scale. Combinations without SNe (BAO+CMB), as well as any single dataset, retain strong degeneracy directions. These produce significant shifts driven purely by likelihood geometry. These behaviors arise because BAO, CMB, and SNe each constrain only one principal direction in (w0,wa) space. Their degeneracy ridges are misaligned due to distinct redshift sensitivities. In contrast, the full BAO+CMB+SNe likelihood with proper covariance breaks all degeneracies simultaneously. It cleanly recovers the fiducial cosmology, including (w0,wa)=(-1,0) and (Omegam0,H0). Our results provide a transparent benchmark for assessing future claims of omega(z) neq -1. They emphasize the need for complete multi-probe analyses with flexible H0 and rd priors.

 - **Abstract**
 Carbon monoxide (CO) emission is a widely used tracer of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) in the interstellar medium (ISM), owing to its abundance, low excitation energy, and ease of detection in cold molecular environments, in contrast to $\mathrm{H}_2$ itself. While the CO-to-$\mathrm{H}_2$ conversion factor is often assumed to be constant across the disks of galaxies, deviations are observed in extreme environments such as the central molecular zone (CMZ) in galactic nuclei. Here we present the first estimate of the CO-to-$\mathrm{H}_2$ conversion factor on sub-kpc scales. We calculate CO-to-$\mathrm{H}_2$ conversion in the Milky Way's Circumnuclear Disk/Ring (CND/CNR) at $\sim 1$ pc radius around the Galactic Center black hole. We derive a conversion factor of $\alpha_\mathrm{CO} \simeq 4.5\pm2.5 \, M_\odot (\mathrm{K \, km \, s^{-1} pc^2})^{-1}$ or X[CO] $\simeq (2.1\pm1.1)\times 10^{20} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} (\mathrm{K \, km \, s^{-1}})^{-1}$. This value is consistent with the Galactic disk but higher than CMZ.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) are very appealing dark matter (DM) candidates. It is highly plausible though, should they exist, that they would not make up all of the DM. Several studies showed that if the rest of DM is made of thermal particles, then these should accumulate around such PBHs, leading to the formation of very dense spikes in the radiation era. We contributed a detailed analytical study about this phenomenon, providing clear explanations as for the origin of scaling relations in the form of power-law density profiles with up to 3 different spectral indices, i.e. $3/4$, $3/2$, and $9/4$, and 4 asymptotic regimes. Here, we further derive an approximate analytical solution that enables fast numerical predictions for the density profiles of these spikes. We also address the specific case of self-annihilating DM species and derive new approximate analytical formulae. Our approximate density yields the correct annihilation rate within $\pm 15\%$ precision. We then focus on indirect detection in the cosmic microwave background and in extragalactic gamma-rays. We shed new and subtle light on how mutually exclusive PBHs and self-annihilating DM species can really be. In particular, the discovery of a population of sub-solar PBHs would set stringent constraints on the $s$-wave annihilation cross-section of these particles, a point so far missed in the literature.

 - **Abstract**
 The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has identified several individual neutrino emitters associated with supermassive black hole accretion phenomena, including blazars, tidal disruption events, and, unexpectedly, Seyfert galaxies. A key open question is which types of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are most likely to be neutrino emitters. Here we show that high-confidence extragalactic neutrino emitters tend not only to have higher hard X-ray fluxes but also to be more variable in mid-infrared (MIR) than other AGNs in the \textit{Swift} BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey. MIR variations effectively trace long-term fluctuations in AGN accretion disks and/or jets. In addition to the role of X-ray flux emphasized in previous studies, we speculate that long-term central engine fluctuations may also be critical for neutrino production. This hypothesis may inform IceCube neutrino-electromagnetic counterpart association studies and provide new insights into cosmic ray acceleration sites. First, the observed neutrinos are unlikely to originate from AGN host galaxies or from interactions between large-scale (dozens of parsecs) winds/outflows and the surrounding interstellar medium. Second, if neutrinos are produced in the X-ray corona, the corona should exhibit strong magnetic turbulence dissipation or magnetic reconnection whose rate changes substantially on timescales of years. Third, the relativistic jets of blazar neutrino emitters may be intrinsically unstable over years. Finally, if neutrinos are related to interactions between small-scale winds/outflows and torus clouds, such winds/outflows must be highly episodic.

#### Probing Dark Matter Substructure with Image Number Anomaly in Strong Lensing Systems

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing observables, including anomalies in image positions, flux ratios, and time delays, serve as usual probes of dark matter (DM) substructure. When dark matter substructure possesses sufficient perturbations, it may lead to the formation of extra images in otherwise canonical doubly or quadruply imaged systems. With the advent of increasingly precise observational instruments, previously undetectable images may become measurable and image number anomalies therefore could be an increasingly viable method. In this paper, we utilize the gravitational lensing phenomenon of image number anomaly to derive constraints on dark matter substructure. We present the extra images induced by distinct forms of DM substructure, specifically primordial black holes (PBHs) and fuzzy dark matter (FDM) and show that higher angular resolution observations increase the probability of detecting additional lensed images. Based on a null detection of image number anomalies in a sample of 3500 lens systems generated from the \textit{Strong Lensing Halo model-based mock catalogs} (SL-Hammocks), we derive upper limits on the abundance of PBHs. At the 95\% confidence level, the PBH abundance is constrained to $\lesssim 0.125\%$, $0.08\%$, and $0.04\%$ for PBH masses in the range $\sim 10^{7}$--$10^{9}~M_{\odot}$, corresponding to angular resolutions of $0.1''$, $0.05''$, and $0.01''$, respectively. Similarly, we exclude particle masses below $0.4$, $0.6$, and $3.5 \times 10^{-22} \ \mathrm{eV}$ for FDM at the same confidence level for the respective resolutions. Furthermore, the abundance of PBHs $\lesssim 0.9\%$ could be constrained at an angular resolution of $0.5''$ for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Observations. Finally, we discuss methodologies for identifying image number anomalies in special cases and demonstrate feasibility using a fitting procedure.

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic accretion onto compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars is one of the most efficient known mechanisms for converting gravitational potential energy into radiation. In the case of rapidly spinning black holes, up to $40\%$ of the rest-mass energy of accreting matter can be released, far exceeding the efficiency of nuclear fusion. In this work, we investigate magnetized particle motion and relativistic accretion processes around a decoupled hairy black hole via extended geometric deformation. The developed geometry involves two hairy parameters that preserve the horizon structure with the additional feature of the fulfillment of weak energy conditions outside the event horizon. We provide the foundation with necessary formalism for magnetized particle motion around a decoupled black hole. The effective potential and innermost stable circular orbits are then derived, which demonstrate a significant reduction of the radius of the latter quantity under the hairy parameters for the magnetized particle. Afterwards, we obtain exact analytical expressions for radial velocity profiles, mass accretion rates, and a few others which reveal improved energy efficiency and emissivity as compared to the standard black hole. Furthermore, the decoupling parameter shows strong influence on oscillations, accretion presenting fantastic agreement between analytical predictions and numerical simulations, and thus offering noticeable observational signatures for future gravitational wave and X-ray astronomy.

#### Constraining non-minimally coupled squared-Quartic Hilltop Inflation in light of ACT observations

 - **Abstract**
 The combination of the data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) with the recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) indicate that the scalar spectral index \( n_s \) has a larger value than the Planck 2018 which leads to tension within standard inflationary models. In this study in order to explain the new data, We consider the squared-Quartic Hilltop inflation potential \( V(\phi) = V_0 [1 - \lambda (\phi/M_p)^4]^2 \) within the Einstein and Jordan frames. In the Jordan frame we introduce the coupling term \( \xi \phi^2 R \) and we calculate analytic expressions for the slow-roll parameters, scalar spectral index, and tensor-to-scalar ratio on the weak and strong coupling regimes. In the weak limit (\( \xi \ll 1 \)), perturbative corrections slightly increase \( n_s \) and suppress \( r \), leading to \( n_s \simeq 0.9743 \) and \( r \sim 7.8 \times 10^{-5} \) for representative parameters \( \lambda = 10^{-3}, \xi = 10^{-3}, {\cal N} = 117 \), values which are in agreement with the joint Planck--ACT--DESI (P-ACT-LB) constraints. On the other hand, for a strong coupled (\( \xi \gg 1 \)), the conformal rescaling provides an exponentially flat potential plateau, which allows us to calculate \( n_s \approx 0.9743 \) with \( r \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4} \) for \( {\cal N} = 65{-}70 \), consistent with ACT and BK18 bounds. The associated energy scale of inflation, \( V_0^{1/4} \sim 10^{-3}{-}10^{-2} M_p \), remains compatible with high-scale inflationary scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of the covariance spectrum of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 during its hard state. For the first time, we extend coherence and covariance studies into the hard X-ray band up to 150 keV. We detect a clear drop in coherence above 30 keV on both short- and long-timescales relative to the 2-10 keV reference band. To investigate the origin of the coherent variability, we simultaneously fit the short- and long-timescale covariances and the time-averaged spectra with a Comptonization model. Surprisingly, the electron temperature associated with long-timescale variability is significantly higher than that on short timescales. Moreover, the temperature on long timescales remains relatively constant throughout the hard state, whereas the short-timescale temperature evolves with X-ray luminosity. We attribute the drop in coherence to multiple sources of seed photons, i.e., the blackbody and synchrotron photons. The independence between these two photon fields leads to the drop in coherence. To explain the lower electron temperature on short timescales, we propose a two-Comptonization framework in which short-timescale variability arises from a vertically extended central region, while long-timescale variability originates at larger radii. The elevated geometry of the inner region leads to illumination primarily by cooler outer-disk photons, yielding a lower electron temperature. In this case, the evolution of the height of the elevated region could explain the evolution of the electron temperature associated with the coherent variability throughout the hard state.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the angular clustering and effective bias of photometrically selected quasars in the Kilo-Degree Survey Data Release 4 (KiDS DR4). We update the previous photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) of the KiDS quasars using Hybrid-z, a deep learning framework combining four-band KiDS images and nine-band KiDS+VIKING magnitudes. Hybrid-z is trained on the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17 quasars matching with KiDS, and achieves average bias $\langle \delta z \rangle < 0.01$ and scatter $\sim 0.04(1 + z)$ on a test sample. The updated catalog of $\sim 157k$ quasars over $777~\mathrm{deg}^2$ is divided into four tomographic bins spanning $0.1 \leq z_{\mathrm{phot}} \leq 2.7$. In each bin, we measure the angular two-point correlation function and compare it with theoretical predictions for dark matter clustering. We estimate the best-fit scale-independent quasar bias, which increases from $b \approx 1.6$ at $z \approx 0.6$ to $b \approx 4.0$ at $z \approx 2.2$, and is well matched by a quadratic relation in redshift. Our clustering analysis indicates that KiDS quasars reside in dark matter halos of mass $\log_{10}(M_{\mathrm{eff}}/h^{-1}M_\odot)$ in the range $\sim 12.7$--$12.9$ and effective peak heights $\nu_{\mathrm{eff}}$ rising from $\sim 1.5$ to $2.9$ over our redshift span. We study two systematics that could affect the bias derivation: stellar contamination and the redshift distribution assumed in the theoretical modeling. The former has a negligible effect, whereas the latter significantly impacts the derived $b(z)$, emphasizing the importance of redshift calibration. Our work is the first cosmological application of quasars selected from KiDS and paves the way for future extensions in the final KiDS DR5, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, or the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope.

#### Effect of the Memory Burden on Primordial Black Hole Hot Spots

 - **Abstract**
 When primordial black holes (PBHs) evaporate, they deposit energy in the surrounding plasma, leading to temperature gradients, or hot spots, that evolve during the evaporation process. Motivated by recent studies suggesting that a memory burden may slow down PBH evaporation, we explore how a suppression of the evaporation rate affects the morphology of such hot spots. We include such a suppression in the form of transfer functions and derive general formulas for the hot-spot core temperature and radius. Applying our results to illustrative scenarios, we find that in the vanilla memory burden scenario in which the evaporation rate and Hawking temperature are exactly constant, the hot-spot temperature is substantially lowered. Nonetheless, we show that alternative scenarios may lead to sizeable hot spots with morphologies that differ significantly from the semi-classical case.

 - **Abstract**
 Variability studies of the broad emission lines of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) and quasars show stochastic radial velocity variations (i.e., fluctuations in the centroid of the line), 'jitter', on timescales of weeks to months. This jitter may be intrinsic as the broad-line emitting region (BLR) reverberates from the AGN continuum. There are also coordinated variations in the width of the broad emission lines and the luminosity of the central source ('breathing' or 'anti-breathing') which remain unexplained. These can be used as a tool for testing models of the BLR. We have constructed a pipeline to simulate a disk-like BLR geometry that reverberates in response to various chosen continuum light curves and produce synthetic emission line profiles. These profiles can then be characterized by measured shape parameters (centroid velocity shift, velocity dispersion, and Pearson skewness coefficient) and compared to observed time series of those same parameters. We have found that through our pipeline, we can recreate the velocity jitter at similar variations found in observations. The computational tools presented in this paper will also be applicable to case studies of quasars observed under the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Black Hole Mapper reverberation mapping program. This paper is the first in a series of papers -- in this paper, we present the model and pipeline, and in future papers, we will present applications.

#### A XRISM View of Relativistic Reflection in Cygnus X-1

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first high-resolution XRISM/Resolve view of the relativistically broadened Fe K line in Cygnus X-1. The data clearly separate the relativistic broad line from the underlying continuum and from narrow emission and absorption features in the Fe band. The unprecedented spectral resolution in the Fe K band clearly demonstrates that the flux excess can be attributed to a single, broad feature, as opposed to a superposition of previously unresolved narrow features. This broad feature can be best interpreted as emission consistent with an origin near the innermost stable circular orbit around a rapidly rotating black hole. By modeling the shape of the broad line, we find a black hole spin of $a\simeq0.98$ and an inclination of the inner accretion disk of $\theta\simeq63^\circ$. The spin is consistent with prior reflection studies, reaffirming the robustness of past spin measurements using the relativistic reflection method. The measured inclination provides reinforcing evidence of a disk-orbit misalignment in Cygnus X-1. These results highlight the unique abilities of XRISM in separating overlapping spectral features and providing constraints on the geometry of accretion in X-ray binaries.

 - **Abstract**
 The regions around massive black holes can show X-ray variability on timescales from seconds to decades. Observing many black holes over different timescales can enhance our chances of detecting variability coming from (partial) tidal disruption events, massive black hole binaries, changing state AGN, blazar activity and much more. X-ray catalogues with hundreds of thousands of detections are treasure troves of such sources, which require innovative methods to identify these black holes. We present the current XMM-Newton catalogues available and describe several examples of tidal disruption events (TDEs) and quasi-periodic eruption sources that have been found whilst mining this data. We describe preliminary work on a search for periodic variables in the XMM-Newton EPIC archival data, with the example of finding new massive black hole binaries. We also describe the STONKS pipeline that is now in the XMM-Newton automatic reduction pipeline and the near real-time alert system that allows the follow-up of new and fading transients. We provide examples of fading sources that are newly identified candidate TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present performance simulations for a proposed visible-light, multi-conjugate adaptive optics system for the 10-meter W. M. Keck I telescope that aims to deliver near diffraction-limited angular resolution at optical wavelengths. Our proposed architecture, the Keck Optical Laser Guide Star Adaptive Optics System (KOLA), combines multiple laser guide stars (LGS) and deformable mirrors to enable wide-field correction across a 60 arcsecond field of view. Simulations were conducted using the open-source Multi-Threaded Adaptive Optics Simulator (MAOS), which we validated against on-sky data for the current Keck I adaptive optics system. We evaluated KOLA performance across a range of design parameters and report key point spread function metrics, including Strehl ratio, full width at half maximum, and encircled energy radius. Example science-driven requirements include resolving black hole spheres of influence, probing crowded stellar fields, and imaging protoplanetary disks. Trade studies on actuator count and laser guide star configuration help inform future design decisions. We present a nominal KOLA design (10 LGS, 3 tip-tilt natural guide stars (TTNGS), and 3600 actuators on the adaptive secondary mirror). Performance simulations show a 15 mas angular resolution with a Strehl ratio of 34% at 652 nm on-axis. More work is needed to explore alternative LGS/TTNGS asterisms, optimize conjugation heights for high-altitude deformable mirrors, and test performance under poorer seeing conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 Lyman-Alpha Emitters (LAEs) are star-forming galaxies with significant Ly$\alpha$ emission and are often used as tracers of large-scale structure at high redshift. We explore the relationship between the Ly$\alpha$ line profile and environmental density with spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) of LAEs selected with narrow-band photometry through the One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey. We use LAE surface density maps in the N419 (z $\sim$ 2.45) and N501 (z $\sim$ 3.12) narrow bands to probe the relationship between local environmental density and the Ly$\alpha$ line profile. In both narrow bands, we stack the LAE spectra in bins of environmental density and inside and outside of protocluster regions. The N501 data shows $\sim$15% higher Ly$\alpha$ line luminosity for galaxies in protoclusters, suggesting increased star formation in these regions. However, the line luminosity is not appreciably greater in protocluster galaxies in the N419 band, suggesting a potential redshift evolution of this effect. The shape of the line profile itself does not vary with environmental density, suggesting that line shape changes are caused by local effects independent of a galaxy's environment. These data indicate a potential relationship between LAE local environmental density, ionized gas distribution, and Ly$\alpha$ line luminosity.

#### All-sky search for continuous gravitational-wave signals from unknown neutron stars in binary systems in the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run

 - **Abstract**
 We present the results of a blind all-sky search for continuous gravitational-wave signals from neutron stars in binary systems using data from the first part of the fourth observing run (O4a) using LIGO detectors data. Rapidly rotating, non-axisymmetric neutron stars are expected to emit continuous gravitational waves, whose detection would significantly improve our understanding of the galactic neutron star population and matter under extreme conditions, while also providing valuable tests of general relativity. Neutron stars in binary systems likely constitute a substantial fraction of the unobserved galactic population and, due to potential mass accretion, may emit stronger gravitational-wave signals than their isolated counterparts. This search targets signals from neutron stars with frequencies in the 100-350 Hz range, with orbital periods between 7 and 15 days and projected semi-major axes between 5 and 15 light-seconds. The analysis employs the GPU-accelerated fasttracks pipeline. No credible astrophysical signals were identified, and, in the absence of a detection, we report search sensitivity estimates on the population of neutron stars in binary systems in the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Tests of general relativity (GR) with gravitational waves (GWs) introduce additional deviation parameters in the waveform model. The enlarged parameter space makes inference computationally costly, which has so far limited systematic, large-scale studies that are essential to quantify degeneracies, check effect of waveform systematics, and assess robustness across non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise effects. The need is even sharper for next-generation (XG) observatories where signals are longer, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are higher, and likelihood evaluations increase substantially. We address this by applying relative binning to the TIGER framework for parameterized tests of GR. Relative binning replaces dense frequency evaluations with evaluations on adaptively chosen frequency bins, reducing the cost per likelihood call while preserving posterior accuracy. Using simulated binary black hole signals, we demonstrate unbiased recovery for GR-consistent cases and targeted non-GR deviations, and we map how bin resolution controls accuracy, with fine binning primarily required for the $-1$ post-Newtonian term. A high-SNR simulated signal at next-generation sensitivity further shows accurate recovery with tight posteriors. Applied to GW150914 and GW250114, both single and multi-parameter TIGER analyses finish within a day, yielding deviation bounds consistent with GR at 90\% credibility and in agreement with previous results. Across analyses, the method reduces wall time by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ to $\mathcal{O}(100)$, depending on frequency range and binning, without degrading parameter estimation accuracy.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the exceptional points (EPs) and their pseudospectra in black hole perturbation theory. By considering a Gaussian bump modification to the Regge-Wheeler potential with variable amplitude, position, and width parameters, $(\varepsilon,d,\sigma_0)$, a continuous line of EPs (exceptional line, EL) in this three-dimensional parameter space is revealed. We find that the vorticity $\nu=\pm1/2$ and the Berry phase $\gamma=\pi$ for loops encircling the EL, while $\nu=0$ and $\gamma=0$ for those do not encircle the EL. Through matrix perturbation theory, we prove that the $\epsilon$-pseudospectrum contour size scales as $\epsilon^{1/q}$ at an EP, where $q$ is the order of the largest Jordan block of the Hamiltonian-like operator, contrasting with the linear $\epsilon$ scaling at non-EPs. Numerical implements confirm this observation, demonstrating enhanced spectral instability at EPs for non-Hermitian systems including black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 The Two-Measure theory (TMT) has been developing since 1998 and has yielded a number of highly interesting results, including those not realized in traditional field theory models. The most important advantage of TMT as an alternative theory is that, under the conditions under which all classical tests of general relativity are performed, TMT models are able to accurately reproduce Einstein's general relativity. Despite this, TMT is still often perceived as something too exotic to be relevant to reality. In fact, the fundamental idea underlying TMT seems undeniable: if we truly believe in the effectiveness of mathematics in studying nature, we must agree that there must be a correspondence between the fundamental laws of nature and the structure of the mathematical apparatus necessary to adequately describe them. It then turns out that there is no reason to ignore the volume measure existing on the differentiable manifold on which the theory of gravity and matter fields is built. This idea has far-reaching implications. The goals of this paper are: 1) to provide a clear mathematical and conceptual justification for TMT; 2) to collect in a single article some of the main results of TMT obtained over the past 25 years.

 - **Abstract**
 The emergence of the $r=0$ singularity inside a spherically symmetric charged black hole, is studied numerically within the Einstein-Maxwell-real scalar model. When the scalar field reaches a critical strength, the $r=0$ singularity emerges inside of the black hole at the tip of the causal diamond. By varying the parameter $p$ of the initial profile for the scalar field towards the critical value ${p_*}$, we observe the areal radius at the tip follows a power law scaling, ${r_S } \propto {| {p - {p_*}}|^\gamma }$, with a universal critical exponent $\gamma\approx 0.5$. This remarkable discovery, analogous to Choptuik's critical phenomena for the black hole formation, provides the first evidence of the universality and scaling for the emergence of the $r=0$ singularity inside black holes, offering new insights into the nonlinear dynamics of strong gravitational field.

 - **Abstract**
 A number of theoretical proposals have been made for horizonless compact objects with masses and spins similar to those of black holes. While gravitational wave signatures from their mergers can resemble those of black holes, features like the spin-induced quadrupole moment may reveal their distinct nature. Using the tight bounds on the spin-induced quadrupole moment of GW241011, we place gravitational wave constraints on the nature of its primary. We find that large classes of exotic compact objects (including rotating boson stars) cannot explain its nature, however, models of sufficiently large compactness of $C \gtrsim 0.24$ may still be viable contenders.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of dilaton black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity through a correspondence with the quantum Seiberg-Witten (SW) curve of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SU(2) gauge theory with $N_f=3$ hypermultiplets. By mapping both the black hole perturbation equation and the quantum SW curve to the confluent Heun form, the QNM problem is reformulated in a gauge-theoretic framework, and the spectrum is obtained via the SW quantization condition. The resulting frequencies show excellent agreement with those computed using the WKB and continued fraction methods, with typical deviations below $10^{-3}$. The QNM spectrum exhibits consistent trends: increasing the black hole charge or scalar field mass raises the oscillation frequency, while higher angular momentum reduces the damping rate. These results demonstrate the precision of the quantum SW framework in describing black hole perturbations and reveal new links between supersymmetric gauge theories and gravitational dynamics.

#### A Unified Causal Framework for Nonlinear Electrodynamics Black Hole from Courant-Hilbert Approach: Thermodynamics and Singularity

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a unified framework for analyzing black hole thermodynamics and spacetime structure in Einstein gravity coupled to causal nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) in asymptotically anti--de Sitter backgrounds. The electromagnetic sector is governed by a Generalized Nonlinear Electrodynamics (GNED) Lagrangian obtained from a root-$T\bar T$ deformation constructed via the Courant--Hilbert approach, ensuring both duality invariance and causal propagation. This theory contains ModMax, Generalized Born-Infeld (GBI), and self-dual logarithmic electrodynamics as continuous limits. Within this framework we obtain exact charged AdS black hole solutions and perform a detailed study of their thermodynamic properties, including mass, temperature, entropy, and free energy. The resulting phase structure exhibits van der~Waals-type transitions between small and large black holes and features a characteristic swallowtail in the free energy at the critical point. We further investigate the internal geometry and show that the nature of the central singularity is determined by the matter fields sourcing the spacetime. Analysis of the Kretschmann scalar demonstrates how gravity and electromagnetism jointly control curvature blow-up in charged and ModMax black holes, with gravity providing the leading divergence. In contrast, (GBI) and logarithmic (NED) models imprint distinct singularity profiles governed by the specific functional form of their Lagrangians. Examining the near-origin behavior of the metric allows us to identify the parameter ranges that support an event horizon and to determine when the solution instead becomes a naked singularity. Overall, the comparison across models reveals that different causal NED theories produce identifiable signatures in both the strength of the singularity and the conditions for horizon formation.
