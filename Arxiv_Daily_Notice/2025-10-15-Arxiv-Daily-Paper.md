 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts $z\geq 9$ remains one of the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive ``heavy seeds'' must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars -- massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores -- believed to be the progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes to $\geq 10^3\,M_{\odot}$ under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55$M_*$ -- five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the dark matter (DM) halo environment in which galaxies that host active galactic nuclei (AGN) reside is a window into the nature of supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion. We apply halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling tools to interpret the angular cross-correlation functions between $1.5\times10^6$ luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and our $\sim28,500$ Hyper Suprime-Cam + Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer-selected (and $L_{6 \mu m}$-limited) AGN to infer the halo properties of distinct quasar samples at physical scales $s>0.1\,{\rm Mpc}$, for $z\in0.7-1.0$. We find that Type I (unobscured) and Type II (obscured) AGN cluster differently, both on small and large physical scales. The derived HODs imply that Type I AGN reside, on average, in substantially ($\sim3\times$) more massive halos ($M_h \sim 10^{13.4} M_\odot$) than Type II AGN ($M_h \sim 10^{12.9} M_\odot$) at $>5\sigma$ significance. While Type II AGN show one-halo correlations similar to that of galaxies of their average halo mass, the Type I AGN intra-halo clustering signal is significantly shallower. We interpret this observation with HOD methods and find Type I AGN are significantly less likely ($f_{sat}\sim0.05^{+1}_{-0.05}\%$) to be found in satellite galaxies than Type II AGN. We find reddened + obscured AGN to have typical satellite fractions for their inferred average halo mass ($\sim10^{13} M_\odot$), with $f_{sat} \sim 20^{+10}_{-5}\%$. Taken together, these results pose a significant challenge to the strict unified AGN morphological model, and instead suggest that a quasar's spectral class is strongly correlated with its host galaxy's dark matter halo environment. These intriguing results have provided a more complex picture of the SMBH -- DM halo connection, and motivate future analyses of the intrinsic galaxy and accretion properties of AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 The centers of massive elliptical galaxies exhibit a wide range in density profiles, from central cusps to resolved cores with order kiloparsec sizes. The cored ellipticals have been linked to the presence of supermassive black hole binaries that excavate their hosts' central stellar populations through three-body encounters. This connection between cores and black holes similarly operates in globular clusters, which also exhibit a bimodality in cored and core-collapsed architectures, respectively rich and depleted in stellar black holes. We report new estimates of the total black hole mass in 25 Galactic globular clusters based on a suite of roughly 150 Monte Carlo $N$-body simulations that fit observed surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles. We show that both globular clusters and massive elliptical galaxies individually exhibit strong correlations between total black hole mass ($M_\bullet$) and core radius ($r_c$), and that these individual relations share a common power-law exponent to within $1\sigma$ statistical precision: $M_\bullet \sim r_c^{1.3}$. The individual relations appear to be offset, suggesting swarms of stellar black holes scour globular cluster cores more efficiently than lone supermassive black holes scour the cores of massive ellipticals. Yet the shared basis of core scouring via black hole binaries hints at a unified $M_{\bullet}-r_c$ connection across over 10 orders of magnitude in $M_\bullet$. Our findings imply core radius measurements may offer a powerful observational constraint on black hole merger rates, from kilohertz sources detectable by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA formed in globular clusters to millihertz and nanohertz sources formed in massive elliptical galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The attracting properties of gravity enable matter present in cores to collapse into stars with seven orders of magnitude change in space and time making modelling of star formation a challenging multi-scale process. To circumvent this scale problem stars are replaced by a sub-grid sink particle at a much larger scale. Sink particles are created above a threshold density and acquire mass and momentum through accretion. In models where binary star systems form and migrate to separations of a few cells, the accretion flow is unresolved and the relative accretion rate to the sink particles may become inaccurate. We introduce a new recipe for accretion onto binary sink particles that have overlapping accretion regions and implement an algorithm to track the angular momentum of sink particles as a proxy for the stellar spin. Our preferential binary accretion recipe uses a virtual binary sink particle for the purpose of accretion and redistribute the accreted mass onto the sink particles according to results from models investigating binary accretion in detail. This solves problems common to current algorithms in many codes: (i) accretion is not suppressed due to large velocity differences between gas and stars, when that velocity is only internal to the binary system, (ii) the accretion rates are smoother for the unresolved close binaries in eccentric orbits, and (iii) non-physical suppression of accretion onto the secondary sink particle when the primary dominates the potential is eliminated. We test our implementation by comparing simulations at increasing resolution until the binaries are resolved. While not perfect, it mitigates undesired properties of current algorithms and in particularly for global models of starforming regions. It may also be applied to other unresolved accreting binaries, such as compact objects in clusters and binary supermassive black holes in cosmological models.

#### A Possible Shutting-Down Event of Mass Accretion in An Active Galactic Nucleus at z~1.8

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of a large gradual apparent fading event in optical and near-infrared wavelengths in a quasar at z=1.767 by a factor of 20-30 (in optical) over a period of ~20 years in the observed frame. This pronounced fading trend in brightness was first identified by comparing the magnitudes measured in the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) images with those in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images for ~3x10^4 quasars spectroscopically identified by SDSS. We performed follow-up observations, including optical imaging and spectroscopy as well as near-infrared imaging, with >4m-class telescopes such as Subaru, GTC, Keck, and SOAR telescopes. We combine these new data with the archival data to examine the variability behavior over ~20 years in detail and even the longer-term trend of the variability over ~70 years in the observed frame. We find that (i) the AGN component likely faded by a factor of ~50 from the early 2000s to 2023 and (ii) the observed brightness decline is best explained by a substantial decrease in accretion rate rather than time-varying line-of-sight dust obscuration. These findings are derived from multi-component (time-varying AGN + constant galaxy) spectral energy distribution fitting over multi-epochs, which is well consistent with the optical spectra. The Eddington ratio decreases by a factor of ~50, from ~0.4 to ~0.008 if we use the black hole mass measured with the SDSS spectrum, which could be highly uncertain because of the very large variability. The total brightness is dominated by the host galaxy in the rest-frame optical wavelength rather than the AGN as of 2023.

 - **Abstract**
 The advent of the X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer Resolve onboard the XRISM space telescope opened a new era for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of astrophysical plasmas. Many spectral features were newly detected, including the K alpha and K beta inner-shell transition lines of mildly ionized (F- to Li-like) Fe at 6-8 keV in the spectra of X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei. The widely used atomic databases contain information on the K alpha but not K beta lines of these ions. We conducted the atomic structure calculation using FAC to derive the Fe K alpha and K beta lines and verified the result against ground experiments and other calculations of the Fe K alpha lines. We then implemented the Fe K beta lines in a radiative transfer code (cloudy) and compared the synthesized and observed spectra with XRISM. A reasonably good agreement was obtained between the observation and the ab initio calculations. This exemplifies the need to expand the atomic databases to interpret astrophysical spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are the link between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes. Gravitational waves have started unveiling a population of IMBHs in the $\sim 100-300 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ range. Here, we investigate the formation of IMBHs from very massive stars (VMSs, $>100\,{} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$). We calculate new VMS models that account for the transition from optically thin to optically thick winds, and study how this enhanced mass loss affects IMBH formation and the black hole mass function at intermediate and high metallicity ($Z=10^{-4}-0.02$). We show that optically thick winds suppress the formation of IMBHs from direct VMS collapse at metallicities $Z>0.001$, one order of magnitude lower than predicted by previous models. Our models indicate that the stellar progenitors of GW231123 must have had a metallicity $Z<0.002$, if the primary black hole formed via direct VMS collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 Lensed gravitational wave (GW) events are expected to be powerful new probes of cosmology, contingent on redshift measurement by electromagnetic observations. Host galaxy identification is thus crucial but challenging due to poor localization by GW signal alone. In this paper, we show that the third-generation ground-based GW detectors will detect a population of lensed events with three or more detectable images (including the central one), each arriving at distinct times and Earth locations in the space, forming an effective network that reduces the typical localization area to $\sim0.01$ deg$^2$. For at least $90\%$ (or $50\%$) of these events, the localization improves by more than a factor of $10$ (or $30$) comparing with unlensed cases. Such precise localization and multiple-image detections enable robust host-galaxy identification and, through lens modelling, further yield sub-arcsecond position. As ``dark lensed sirens", these events become powerful probes of cosmological parameters. Using simulated lensed compact-binary mergers, we show that two-year or longer observations with third-generation GW detectors can measure the Hubble constant to $\lesssim1$\% precision via ``dark lensed sirens" (even when relying solely on lensed stellar-mass binary black hole events), while simultaneously constraining other cosmological parameters. This approach will provide an independent, complementary avenue for measuring cosmological parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted high-precision timing of PSR J1946+2052 to determine the masses of the two neutron stars in the system, test general relativity (GR) and assessed the system's potential for future measurement of the moment of inertia of the pulsar. We analysed seven years of timing data from the Arecibo 305-m radio telescope, the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The data processing accounted for dispersion measure variations and relativistic spin precession-induced profile evolution. We employed both DDFWHE and DDGR binary models to measure the spin parameters, kinematic parameters and orbital parameters. The timing campaign has resulted in the precise measurement of five post-Keplerian parameters, which yield very precise masses for the system and three tests of general relativity. One of these is the second most precise test of the radiative properties of gravity to date: the intrinsic orbital decay, $\dot{P}_{\rm b,int}=-1.8288(16)\times10^{-12}\rm\,s\,s^{-1}$, represents $1.00005(91)$ of the GR prediction, indicating that the theory has passed this stringent test. The other two tests, of the Shapiro delay parameters, have precisions of 6\% and 5\% respectively; this is caused by the moderate orbital inclination of the system, $\sim 74^{\circ}$; the measurements of the Shapiro delay parameters also agree with the GR predictions. Additionally, we analysed the higher-order contributions of $\dot{\omega}$, including the Lense-Thirring contribution. Both the second post-Newtonian and the Lense-Thirring contributions are larger than the current uncertainty of $\dot{\omega}$ ($\delta\dot{\omega}=4\times10^{-4}\,\rm deg\,yr^{-1}$), leading to the higher-order correction for the total mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Robust extragalactic distance measurements are crucial for resolving the persistent discrepancy in the value of the Hubble constant (H$_0$)). Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), through their compact and variable broad-line regions (BLRs), enable the determination of geometric distances when reverberation mapping (RM) is combined with spectroastrometry(SA). We report results from a spectroscopic RM campaign (October 2022 to March 2023) targeting two narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, Mrk 1048 and Mrk 618, using 3.6-m DOT and 2-m HCT. High-cadence spectro-photometric monitoring was carried out using onboard instruments such as ADFOSC, HFOSC, and TANSPEC, resulting in well-sampled continuum and emission line light curves. The observed fractional variability ($F_{\mathrm{var}}$) ranged from 4% to 14% across the $g$-band, H$\beta$, and H$\alpha$ light curves. The time lags were measured using the interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF), PyI$^{2}$CCF, and \textsc{JAVELIN} methods. In the rest frame, the ICCF analysis yields H$\beta$ lags of $10.5^{+2.6}_{-4.2}$ days for Mrk 1048 and $10.2^{+3.4}_{-2.9}$ days for Mrk 618, while the corresponding H$\alpha$ lags are $18.7^{+5.3}_{-5.4}$ and $14.4^{+4.6}_{-10.5}$ days, respectively. The emission-line widths, measured from the rms spectra using $\sigma_{\mathrm{line}}$, give virial black hole mass estimates of $6.3^{+2.0}_{-2.1} \times 10^7\,M_\odot$ for Mrk 1048 and $1.2^{+0.4}_{-0.6} \times 10^7\,M_\odot$ for Mrk 618. These results will serve as a basis for absolute geometric distance calibration when combined with VLTI/GRAVITY spectro-astrometric measurements, thereby contributing to the development of AGNs as standardizable cosmological probes.

#### Widespread Hot Molecular Gas Heated by Shear-induced Turbulence in the Galactic Center

 - **Abstract**
 We observed NH3 metastable inversion lines from (3, 3) to (18, 18) toward G0.66-0.13 in the Galactic center with the Shanghai Tianma 65m radio telescope and Yebes 40 m telescope. Highly-excited lines of NH3 (17, 17), (18, 18) were detected in emission for the first time in the interstellar medium, with upper energy levels up to 3100 K. Mapping observations reveal widespread hot molecular gas traced by NH3 (13, 13) toward G0.66-0.13. The rotation temperatures of hot gas traced by NH3 exceed 400 K, which amounts to five percent of the total NH3 in the Galactic Center. Hot gas (>400 K) and warm gas (100-140 K) are found in distinct clumps, with the hot gas located at the interfacing regions between different warm clouds. The theory of intermittency in turbulence reproduces the complex temperature structure in the central molecular zone, especially the hot gas observed here. The results presented here demonstrate that turbulence heating dominates the heating of the molecular gas in the Central Molecular Zone, while the turbulence is induced by the shear-motion of molecular clouds under the gravitational potential of the nuclear star clusters and the supermassive black hole. Our results suggest that shear-induced turbulence heating could be a widespread factor influencing galactic evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological models where dark matter interacts with dark energy via a pure momentum transfer and with no energy exchange (i.e. elastic) provide compelling scenarios for addressing the apparent lack of structures at low redshift. In particular, it has been shown that measurements of $S_8$ may show a statistically significant preference for the presence of elastic interactions. In this work we implement a specific realisation of these scenarios into an $N$-body code to explore the non-linear regime. We include two populations of particles to describe the interacting dark matter and the non-interacting baryons respectively. On linear scales we recover the suppression of structures obtained from Boltzmann codes, while non-linear scales exhibit an enhancement of the matter power. We find that fewer massive halos are formed at low redshift as a consequence of the elastic interaction and that dark matter halos are more compact than in the standard model. Furthermore, the ratio of dark matter and baryons density profiles is not constant. Finally, we corroborate that baryons efficiently cluster around dark matter halos so they provide good tracers of the dark matter velocity field despite the presence of the interaction. This shows that the interaction is not sufficiently strong as to disrupt virialised structures.

#### JWST and Keck Observations of the Off-Nuclear TDE AT 2024tvd: A Massive Nuclear Star Cluster and Minor-Merger Origin for its Black Hole

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam observations of the first optically selected off-nuclear tidal disruption event (TDE), AT 2024tvd, along with Keck/KCWI integral field unit spectroscopy. The spectra show broad H and He emission lines that are characteristic of a TDE. Stellar kinematics show smooth host-galaxy morphology and ordered bulge rotation, with no evidence of disturbances in velocity, dispersion, age or metallicity space. We construct the first quasi-simultaneous spectral-energy distribution (SED) from X-rays to infrared for a TDE and decompose it into three components: the TDE accretion flow, an unresolved nuclear star cluster (NSC), and heated dust emission. The accretion component implies a black hole mass of $\log(M_\bullet/M_\odot) = 5.50\pm 0.04$, an instantaneous super-Eddington accretion rate of $\log (\dot{M}/M_{\odot} yr^{-1}) = -1.22 \pm 0.04$, and an outer disk photosphere radius of $\log(r_{out}/r_{g}) = 3.8 \pm 0.1$. The dust emission is well described by a blackbody with $T_{dust} = 873\pm 15$ K and peak luminosity $\log (L_{dust}/erg$ $s^{-1}) = 40.80\pm 0.01$, consistent with a dust echo near the sublimation radius. The SED is best fit when including additional stellar emission above the galaxy background at the TDE location, corresponding to $\log(M_{\star}/M_\odot) = 7.97^{+0.16}_{-0.26}$, which we interpret as a massive NSC or an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy. These results support a minor-merger origin for the MBH responsible for the TDE over scenarios involving gravitational recoil or dynamical ejection from the nucleus.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar wind mass loss is often assumed to depend on their metallicity $Z$. Therefore, evolutionary models of massive stars at lower $Z$ are able to retain more of their H-rich layers and evolve into brighter cool supergiants (cool SGs; $T_\mathrm{eff} < 7$ kK). Surprisingly, in galaxies in the range $0.2 \lesssim Z / Z_\odot \lesssim 1.5$ previous studies did not find a $Z$-dependence of the upper luminosity limit $L_\mathrm{max}$ of cool SGs. Here, we study four extra galaxies with HST and JWST. Observations of the extremely low-$Z$ dwarf galaxy I Zw 18 from JWST allow us to go down to $Z / Z_\odot \approx 1/40$. For cool SGs in all studied galaxies including I Zw 18, we find a constant $L_\mathrm{max} \approx 10^{5.6}$L$_\odot$, similar to literature results for $0.2 \lesssim Z / Z_\odot \lesssim 1.5$. In I Zw 18 and the other studied galaxies, the presence of Wolf-Rayet stars has been claimed. Although we cannot rule out that some of them become intermediate-temperature objects, this paints a picture in which evolved stars with $L>10^{5.6}$L$_\odot$ burn He as hot He-rich stars down to extremely low $Z$. We argue that $Z$-independent late-phase mass loss would be the most likely mechanism responsible. Regardless of the exact stripping mechanism, for the Early Universe our results imply a limitation on black hole masses and a contribution of stars born with $M\gtrsim 30$M$_\odot$ to its surprisingly strong nitrogen enrichment. We propose a scenario in which single stars at low $Z$ emit sufficiently hard ionizing radiation to produce lines of He II and C IV. In this scenario, late-phase $Z$-independent mass loss produces hot He-rich stars. Due to the well-understood $Z$-dependence of radiation-driven winds of hot stars, a window of opportunity would open below 0.2Z$_\odot$, where self-stripped He-rich stars can exist without dense WR winds that absorb hard ionizing radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 The $H_0$ tension has become one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. The recent DESI DR2 data has shown a significant preference for dynamical dark energy, yet this has further exacerbated the $H_0$ tension. In this work, we explore the potential of new interacting dark energy models ($\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM and $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM) to alleviate the $H_0$ tension. We perform observational constraints using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescop, and type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus, as well as the SH0ES data. From our analysis, we observe the dynamical scale parameter of the cosmological constant, $\delta_{\Lambda} = -0.410^{+0.140}_{-0.120}$, in the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model using the CMB+DESI+SH0ES data, which deviates from $\Lambda$CDM at the $3.2\sigma$ level. Due to the anti-correlation between $\delta_{\Lambda}$ and $H_0$, a negative $\delta_{\Lambda}$ results in a higher inferred $H_0$. Consequently, we obtain $H_0 = 71.90 \pm 1.00~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the $H_0$ tension to $0.8\sigma$. Even without SH0ES, the CMB+DESI data alone still alleviate the $H_0$ tension to $1.7\sigma$. Overall, the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model not only deviates from the $\Lambda$CDM model but also demonstrates a significant capability to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a precise measurement of the westward, rigidity-dependent shift of the Moon's shadow using three and a half years of cosmic-ray data collected by the Kilometer Square Array (KM2A) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). These measurements enable us to calibrate the detector energy response in the range 20-260 TeV, with results showing excellent agreement with the response derived from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the KM2A detector. We also measure a best-fit parameter $\epsilon = 0.015 \pm 0.08$, corresponding to a 95% confidence interval of [-14%, +17%] for the energy-scale estimation. This result establishes the exceptional accuracy of the KM2A-MC in simulating the detector's response within this energy range.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers are transformative events that can cause gaseous inflows capable of triggering active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous studies of AGN in simulations have mainly focused on major interactions (i.e. between approximately equal mass galaxies), which produce the strongest inflows and, therefore, would be the most likely to trigger AGN activity. However, minor interactions are far more common and may still enhance accretion onto supermassive black holes. We present an analysis of post-merger galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulation with stellar mass ratios of $\mu>$1:100. We select post-mergers from the TNG50-1 simulation, from redshifts $0\leq z< 1$, with stellar masses greater than $10^{10}M_{\odot}$. We find an AGN excess in post-mergers with a stellar mass ratio as low as 1:40. The AGN excess is mass ratio and luminosity dependent, with 1.2-1.6 times more AGN found in post-mergers of 1:40$\leq \mu < $1:4 than in matched non-merger controls, and as many as 6 times more AGN found in major $\mu \geq$1:4 post-mergers. The AGN excess is long lived, between 500 Myr to 1 Gyr post-coalescence, across all of the mass ratio regimes. We demonstrate that the most luminous AGN in the simulation overwhelmingly occur in either post-mergers or pairs (with $\mu \geq $1:40). Finally, we demonstrate that mini mergers are likely to be overlooked in observational studies due to the weakness of features usually associated with recent merger activity, such as tidal streams and shells, making it challenging to completely account for merger-induced AGN activity even in deep galaxy surveys.

#### Floquet resonances and redshift-enhanced acceleration radiation from vibrating atoms in Schwarzschild spacetime

 - **Abstract**
 We study acceleration radiation from a two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector that undergoes small-amplitude radial oscillations at fixed mean radius $R_0$ outside a Schwarzschild black hole. The massless scalar field is quantized in the Boulware vacuum to isolate curvature-modulated acceleration effects without a thermal Hawking background. Working in a (1+1) radial reduction and using first-order time-dependent perturbation, we evaluate the period-averaged transition rate (or the "Floquet" transition rate). The resulting particle emission spectrum exhibits a thermal Bose-Einstein-type profile with periodic trajectory yielding a Floquet resonance condition $n\Omega > \omega_0$ and a closed-form expression for the Floquet transition rate $\overline{P}_n$ which reduces to the flat Minkowski spacetime result as $R_0\to\infty$. Near the horizon, $f(R_0)<1$ enhances the effective Bessel argument by $1/\sqrt{f(R_0)}$, providing a simple analytic demonstration of curvature/redshift amplification of acceleration radiation. In particular, the spectrum weighted by Bessel function becomes ill-defined near the black hole horizon as $R_{0}\rightarrow 2M$, possibly manifesting the well-known pathological behavior of Boulware vacuum state. We discuss the regime of validity (small amplitude, $R_0$ away from the horizon) and outline the extensions to (3+1) dimensions, including density-of-states and greybody factors, and to alternative vacuum choices. Our results offer an analytically tractable link between flat-space "vibrating atom" proposals and black-hole spacetimes.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study the late time cosmic acceleration of the Quintessence model within the framework of Hoyle Narlikar Gravity, consisting of a creation field. Using the Hubble tension as a function of the density parameter for matter, the density parameter for radiation, and the density parameter for dark energy in the covariant formulation, we find the gravitational field equations in the spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic spacetime to examine the dynamical mechanism that leads to cosmic acceleration in the late-time universe. We analyze the observational constraints on the late-time density parameters using various recent observational datasets, including the Hubble datasets, Pantheon+, and joint compilation, Pantheon++BAO. Consequently, it is explicitly demonstrated that late-time cosmic acceleration can be consistent with recent observational data in Hoyle Narlikar Gravity with non-minimal matter interaction. In contrast with other modified theories of gravity, it is observed that the creation field theory with non-minimal matter interaction renders more compact constraints on the Hubble tension together with density parameters, and extensively explains the accelerating expansion of the universe, which makes it a more plausible option compared to the {\Lambda}CDM model. Furthermore, the w dw phase analysis confirms alternating thawing and freezing behaviour of the model, with all trajectories ultimately converging toward the {\Lambda}CDM point, thereby confirming the model stability and the observational consistency.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole ringdowns in extensions of General Relativity (GR) generically exhibit two distinct signatures: (1) theory-dependent shifts in the standard black-hole quasinormal modes, and (2) additional modes arising from extra fundamental fields --such as scalar, vector, or tensor degrees of freedom-- that can also contribute to the gravitational-wave signal. As recently argued, in general both effects are present simultaneously, and accurately modeling them is essential for robust tests of GR in the ringdown regime. In this work, we investigate the impact of extra field-induced modes, which are often neglected in standard ringdown analyses, on the interpretation of gravitational-wave signals. To provide some concrete examples, we focus on dynamical Chern-Simons and Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories, well-motivated extensions of GR, characterized respectively by a parity-odd and a parity-even coupling between a dynamical scalar field and quadratic curvature invariants. We show that including extra field-induced modes improves the bounds on these theories compared to standard spectroscopy and also allows for equally constraining complementary tests not based on quasinormal mode shifts. Our analysis highlights the relevance of incorporating extra field-induced modes in ringdown templates and assesses their potential to either bias or enhance constraints on GR deviations.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical relativity (NR) enables the study of physics in strong and dynamical gravitational fields and provides predictions for the gravitational-wave signals produced by merging black holes. Despite the impressive accuracy of modern codes, the resulting waveforms inevitably contain numerical uncertainties. Quantifying these uncertainties is important, especially for studies probing subdominant or nonlinear effects around the merger and ringdown. This paper describes a flexible Gaussian-process model for the numerical uncertainties in all the spherical-harmonic waveform modes across a state-of-the-art catalog of NR waveforms and a highly efficient procedure for sampling the posteriors of quasinormal mode models without the need for expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo. The Gaussian-process model is used to define a likelihood function which allows many Bayesian data analysis techniques - already widely used in the analysis of experimental gravitational wave data - to be applied to NR waveforms as well. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated by applying it to the analysis of quasinormal modes in Cauchy-characteristic evolved waveforms.

 - **Abstract**
 The strong lensing gravitational waves (GWs) due to intervening massive astrophysical systems between the source and an observer are an inevitable consequence of the general theory of relativity, which can produce multiple GW events in overlapping sky localization error. However, the confirmed detection of such a unique astrophysical phenomenon is challenging due to several sources of contamination, arising from detector noise to astrophysical uncertainties. Robust model-independent search techniques that can mitigate noise contamination were developed in the past. In this study, we explore the astrophysical uncertainty associated with incorrectly classifying a pair of unlensed GW events as a lensed event, and the associated False Alarm Rate (FAR) depending on the GW source properties. To understand the effect of unlensed astrophysical GW sources in producing false lensing detections, we have performed a model-independent test using the pipeline GLANCE on a simulated population of merging binary-black holes (BBHs). We find that $\sim$ 0.01\% of the event pairs can be falsely classified as lensed with a lensing threshold signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5, appearing at a time delay between the event pairs of $\sim$ 1000 days or more. We show the FAR distribution for the parameter space of GW source masses, delay time, and lensing magnification parameter over which the model-independent technique GLANCE can confidently detect lensed GW pair with the current LIGO detector sensitivity. In the future, this technique will be useful for understanding the FAR of the upcoming next-generation GW detectors, which can observe many more GW sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers provide a glimpse of gravitational dynamics in its most extreme observable regime, potentially enabling precision tests of general relativity (GR) and of the Kerr description of black holes. However, until recently, numerical simulations of black hole mergers have not been possible in theories beyond GR. While recent breakthroughs have overcome that obstacle, simulations covering the full, interesting range of binary parameters remain unfeasible. Here we present a new first-principles approach to this problem. We show how self-force theory can be used to model the merger and ringdown of black holes in a broad class of gravitational theories, assuming one object is much smaller than the other. We calculate self-force effects on the merger waveform for the first time, and we demonstrate how our formulation allows us to modularly compute beyond-GR effects and readily incorporate them into a fast merger-ringdown waveform model.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we study the complexity growth rate for Banados Teitlboim Zanelli, Schwarzschild, Reissner Nordstrom, and Kerr black holes using complexity-volume (CV) and complexity-action (CA) dualities and verify that it is proportional to the product of the horizon temperature and entropy of the black holes as conjectured by Susskind. Furthermore, we explore the variation in the complexity growth rate $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ under various physical processes, including the Penrose process, superradiance, particle accretion, and Hawking radiation, and demonstrate that $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ exhibits non-trivial behavior. Under the Penrose process and superradiance, $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ always increases, and under particle accretion, $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ can increase, remain zero, or decrease depending upon the direction of angular momentum of an infalling particle. For the cases of particle accretion, where we find $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ to be negative, we argue that for a reliable estimate, one has to take into account the contribution of the horizon dynamics of the perturbed black hole to the growth of its complexity.

 In this letter, we review the well known ambiguity in defining angular momentum (and mass dipole) fluxes in general relativity and we reinterpret recent works that resolve the ambiguity by defining invariant charges. We resolve the ambiguity by finding the conditions that fix a frame for supertranslation and for space-time translation. We also present an elementary method for measuring the angular momentum aspect and work out explicitly the supertranslation frame-fixing conditions for the metric created by point particles to first nontrivial order in the Newton constant.

 - **Abstract**
 While the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer proposals for next-generation, ground-based detectors promise vastly improved sensitivities to gravitational-wave signals, only joint observations are expected to enable the full scientific potential of these facilities, making timing and coordination between the efforts crucial to avoid missed opportunities. This study investigates the impact of long-term delays on the scientific capabilities of next-generation detector networks. We use the Fisher information formalism to simulate the performance of a set of detector networks for large, fiducial populations of binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and primordial black-hole binaries. Bootstrapping the simulated populations, we map the expected observation times required to reach a number of observations fulfilling scientific targets for key sensitivity and localization metrics across various network configurations. We also investigate the sensitivity to stochastic backgrounds. We find that purely sensitivity-driven metrics such as the signal-to-noise ratio are not strongly affected by delays between facilities. This is contrasted by the localization metrics, which are very sensitive to the number of detectors in the network and, by extension, to delayed observation campaigns for a detector. Effectively, delays in one detector behave like network-wide interruptions for the localization metrics for networks consisting of two next-generation facilities. We examine the impact of a supporting, current-generation detector such as LIGO India operating concurrently with next-generation facilities and find such an addition will greatly mitigate the negative effects of delays for localization metrics, with important consequences on multi-messenger science and stochastic searches.

 - **Abstract**
 We study information paradox of four dimensional covariant black holes inspired by loop quantum gravity (LQG) with two well motivated solutions. We first prepare the spacetime in the Hartle-Hawking state, compute the radiation entropy and recover a linear growth at late time. When considering the mass loss and incorporating greybody factors, we show that for Solution~1 the LQG parameter $\zeta$ leaves temperature and Planckian factor of the spectrum unchanged but enhances the near-horizon barrier, leading to a faster evaporation rate as $M$ decreases. This behavior contrasts sharply with Solution~2, which has slow evaporation rate at small $M$ and admits a non-singular continuation suggestive of a remnant or a black-to-white-hole transition. We then apply the island prescription on the eternal background and find that quantum extremal surfaces exist in solution 1 geometries; $\zeta$ primarily shifts the island boundary and suppresses the late time entropy growth, preserving unitarity. Our results highlight that covariance-respecting LQG black hole do not exhibit a universal late time behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a cosmological analysis of an exponential $f(Q)$ gravity model, within the dynamical systems formalism. Following the method introduced by Böhmer \textit{et al} [Universe \textbf{9} no.4, 166 (2023)], the modified Friedmann modified equations are successfully reduced to an autonomous system. Given the exponential form of $f(Q)$, the equilibrium conditions result in transcendental equations, which we approximate to identify the critical points. We therefore perform a general stability analysis of these points in terms of the model parameters. Finally, we extend the model by including a linear dark energy-dark matter interaction, where the equilibrium points are found with their stability properties. The model exhibits the three main domination epochs in the Universe, as well as a non-trivial impact on the late-time de Sitter attractor.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have shown that a secondary potential barrier, forming a potential well outside the event horizon, can destabilize the Quasinormal Mode (QNM) spectrum of black holes. We find that spectral instability may persist even after the potential well vanishes, giving rise to a distinct family of spectrally unstable QNMs that differ from the spectrally stable modes localized near the potential peak and associated with the photon sphere. Nevertheless, time-domain simulations reveal that early-time ringdown waveforms remain dominated by stable modes, while unstable modes have only a subdominant contribution. These results highlight the robustness of black hole spectroscopy, as the observable ringdown signal is primarily governed by the most stable QNMs.

#### The importance of being non-minimally coupled: scalar Hawking radiation from regular black holes

 - **Abstract**
 In curved space-time, a scalar field $\phi$ is generically expected to couple to curvature, via a coupling of the form $\xi\phi^2R$. Yet in the study of Hawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often introduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is generically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored. We revisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four representative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case $\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation. We compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter can be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A crucial role is played by the sign of the term $\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g_{tt}$ in Schwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal coupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier. For the D'Ambrosio-Rovelli case with large negative $\xi$, the low-energy emission spectrum is enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude, since $\xi fR<0$ throughout the space-time, leading to a deep potential well which broadens the transmissive window. The deviations we find can be particularly relevant in the case where primordial RBHs are dark matter candidates, given the impact of the non-minimal coupling on their evaporation history.

 - **Abstract**
 In the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity, where gravity emerges from non-metricity $Q$, we explore the cosmological implications of its non-minimal coupling to matter. Inspired by the recent success of Chaplygin gas models in explaining dark energy, we consider a background fluid composed of baryonic matter, radiation, and a family of Chaplygin gas variants namely Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG), Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG), and Variable Chaplygin Gas (VCG). We constrain these models with three recent observational datasets: Observational Hubble Data (OHD), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSO) data. For the QSO dataset, we propose an analytical expression for errors in comoving distance to circumvent the reliance on Monte Carlo simulations. Using kinematic diagnostics such as the deceleration and jerk parameters and Om diagnostic, we assess deviations of the proposed models from $\Lambda$CDM. Our joint analysis of the three datasets reveals that the transition redshift from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion of the universe for the GCG, MCG and VCG models is $0.620^{+0.018}_{-0.017}$, $0.537^{+0.017}_{-0.017}$ and $0.470^{+0.012}_{-0.012}$ respectively, indicating a departure from $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper presents OCTOPUS, a relativistic ray-tracing algorithm developed within a Fortran-based, OpenMP-accelerated framework, designed for asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric curved spacetimes. The code efficiently and accurately computes key relativistic features -- including the black hole event horizon, photon rings, critical curves, and innermost stable circular orbits -- and simulates black hole shadows, redshift factor distributions, accretion disk images, toroidal images, as well as gravitational lensing, light curves, and gravitational radiation from hot-spots. OCTOPUS provides an automated, modular solution for qualitative studies of black hole observables and multi-messenger correlations between electromagnetic and gravitational signals in curved spacetime. Its implementation requires only the metric potential and its first-, second-, and third-order radial derivatives as input, ensuring low user barriers while remaining highly extensible and adaptable. Using a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Dehnen-type dark matter halo, we thoroughly validate the algorithm's precision, efficiency, and functionality, and investigate how dark matter halo parameters affect observational signatures. Our results demonstrate that increasing the scale and density of the dark matter halo strengthens the spacetime's gravitational field, an effect clearly reflected in black hole images and supported by hot-spot light curve signatures. A future version of OCTOPUS, with expanded capabilities for axisymmetric spacetimes, is planned for release.

 - **Abstract**
 Taking into account the Green-Schwarz anomaly counterterm in R-symmetry gauged $N=(1,0)$ supergravity in six dimensions, and the associated modification in the Maxwell kinetic term and potential, we observe that the theory admits half-supersymmetric Minkowski$_4\times S^2$ and non-supersymmetric dS$_4 \times S^2$ as exact solutions with a monopole on $S^2$. The monopole charge and the anomaly coefficients play key roles in the vacuum structure and it turns out that a diagonal gauging in which an admixture of an external $U(1)$ with the R-symmetry $U(1)_R$ is needed for the de Sitter solutions to exist. We determine the full Kaluza-Klein spectrum for both vacua. The spectrum is unitary in the Minkowski case but in the case of de Sitter vacuum, two scalars violate the Higuchi unitarity bound, and they represent two tachyonic states, one from the dilaton and the other from the volume of the internal space. We show that turning on small perturbations of the tachyonic modes around the dS$_4\times S^2$ triggers a flow evolving towards Mink$_4\times S^2$ with the minimal potential energy. We also find a nonsupersymmetric AdS$_4\times S^2$ solution, when we turn on a flux associated with external $U(1)$ gauge field only, and show that the phenomenon of scale separation is realized.

 - **Abstract**
 Theories with pseudoscalars that couple through anomalies (such as axion models) are of particular phenomenological interest. We carry out a comprehensive analysis of all bounds obtainable from bootstrapping the amplitudes when a pseudoscalar couples to photons and gravitons. This allows us to find new cutoff scales of theories with anomalies that are more restrictive than those obtained from naive perturbative analysis. Our results are especially relevant for holographic models, as the bounds determine the allowed region of the five-dimensional EFTs, for example, by imposing strong bounds on Chern-Simons terms. We also consider modifications of General Relativity in photon--graviton couplings and show that current experiments are sensitive to these effects only if new physics appears at $\sim 10^{-10}$ eV.

 - **Abstract**
 We study two-dimensional turbulence driven by a scalar operator within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, where the external driving source is used to sustain a quasi-steady turbulent state. We numerically construct dynamical and spatially inhomogeneous turbulent black holes in the asymptotically $\mathrm{AdS}_4$ spacetime by solving the full nonlinear equations of motion in the Bondi-Sachs formalism. The inverse energy cascade and the corresponding energy spectrum of both decaying and driven turbulence are analyzed. The scalar driving leads to a compressible energy dominated flow, and the corresponding scaling power laws agree well with previous simulations of two-dimensional turbulence in compressible fluids. Furthermore, we take a direct estimate of the fractal structure of the turbulent black hole, obtaining a fractal dimension $D\approx2.65$, which matches the result from simulating the boundary conformal fluid.
