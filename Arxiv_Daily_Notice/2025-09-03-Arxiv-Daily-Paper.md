 - **Abstract**
 The presence of massive black holes (BHs) exceeding $10^9\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ already at redshift $z > 6$ challenges standard models of BH growth. Super-Eddington (SE) accretion has emerged as a promising mechanism to solve this issue, yet its impact on early BH evolution in tailored numerical experiments remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the growth of BH seeds embedded in a gas-rich, metal-poor protogalaxy at $z \sim 15$, using a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations that implement a slim-disc-based SE accretion model. We explore a broad parameter space varying the initial BH mass, feedback efficiency, and spin. We find that SE accretion enables rapid growth in all cases, allowing BHs to accrete up to $10^5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ within a few $10^3$-$10^4$ years, independent of seed properties. Feedback regulates this process, both by depleting central gas and altering BH dynamics via star formation-driven potential fluctuations, yet even the strongest feedback regimes permit significantly greater growth than the Eddington-limited case. Growth stalls after less than $\sim$1 Myr due to local gas exhaustion, as no large-scale inflows are present in the adopted numerical setup. Our results show that SE accretion naturally leads to BHs that are over-massive relative to their host galaxy stellar content, consistent with JWST observations. We conclude that short, low-duty-cycle SE episodes represent a viable pathway for assembling the most massive BHs observed at early cosmic times, even starting from light seeds.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the COLIBRE galaxy formation model and the COLIBRE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. COLIBRE includes new models for radiative cooling, dust grains, star formation, stellar mass loss, turbulent diffusion, pre-supernova stellar feedback, supernova feedback, supermassive black holes and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. The multiphase interstellar medium is explicitly modelled without a pressure floor. Hydrogen and helium are tracked in non-equilibrium, with their contributions to the free electron density included in metal-line cooling calculations. The chemical network is coupled to a dust model that tracks three grain species and two grain sizes. In addition to the fiducial thermally-driven AGN feedback, a subset of simulations uses black hole spin-dependent hybrid jet/thermal AGN feedback. To suppress spurious transfer of energy from dark matter to stars, dark matter is supersampled by a factor 4, yielding similar dark matter and baryonic particle masses. The subgrid feedback model is calibrated to match the observed $z \approx 0$ galaxy stellar mass function, galaxy sizes, and black hole masses in massive galaxies. The COLIBRE suite includes three resolutions, with particle masses of $\sim 10^5$, $10^6$, and $10^7\,\text{M}_\odot$ in cubic volumes of up to 50, 200, and 400 cMpc on a side, respectively. The two largest runs use 136 billion ($5 \times 3008^3$) particles. We describe the model, assess its strengths and limitations, and present both visual impressions and quantitative results. Comparisons with various low-redshift galaxy observations generally show very good numerical convergence and excellent agreement with the data.

 - **Abstract**
 Star formation in galaxies is regulated by the interplay of a range of processes that shape the multiphase gas in the interstellar and circumgalactic media. Using the CAMELS suite of cosmological simulations, we study the effects of varying feedback and cosmology on the average star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies at $z\sim0$ across the IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and ASTRID galaxy formation models. We find that galaxy SFHs in all three models are sensitive to changes in stellar feedback, which affects the efficiency of baryon cycling and the rates at which central black holes grow, while effects of varying AGN feedback depend on model-dependent implementations of black hole seeding, accretion and feedback. We also find strong interaction terms that couple stellar and AGN feedback, usually by regulating the amount of gas available for the central black hole to accrete. Using a double power-law to describe the average SFHs, we derive a general set of equations relating the shape of the SFHs to physical quantities like baryon fraction and black hole mass across all three models. We find that a single set of equations (albeit with different coefficients) can describe the SFHs across all three CAMELS models, with cosmology dominating the SFH at early times, followed by halo accretion, and feedback and baryon cycling at late times. Galaxy SFHs provide a novel, complementary probe to constrain cosmology and feedback, and can connect the observational constraints from current and upcoming galaxy surveys with the physical mechanisms responsible for regulating galaxy growth and quenching.

#### Probing the H0 Tension with Holographic Dark Energy in Unimodular Gravity: Insights from DESI DR2

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the recent baryon acoustic oscillation measurements of DESI DR2 collaboration, this works presents an extended analysis of a cosmological model based on holographic dark energy within the framework of Unimodular Gravity. We probe the model with an extensive set of observations: cosmic chronometers, Pantheon Plus$+$SH0ES Type Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 BAO distances, quasar X-ray/UV fluxes (two independent calibrations), and Planck 2018 CMB data. The results are analyzed to assess the modelś ability to alleviate the Hubble tension and, in comparison with the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, to determine which of the two scenarios is preferred according to Bayesian evidence. We conclude that the present implementation of holographic dark energy in Unimodular Gravity, while theoretically appealing, does not alleviate the Hubble tension and is not statistically preferred by Bayesian criteria when compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Nevertheless, in neither case does the preference become very strong or conclusive against it.

#### The Impact of Spectroscopic Redshift Errors on Cosmological Measurements

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic redshift errors, including redshift uncertainty and catastrophic failures, can bias cosmological measurements from galaxy redshift surveys at sub-percent level. We investigate their impact on full-shape clustering analysis using contaminated mock catalogs. We find that redshift uncertainty introduces a damping effect on the power spectrum. This damping is scale-dependent and absorbed by counterterms in the clustering model, keeping parameter biases below $5\%$ for the DESI survey. Catastrophic failures reduce the power spectrum amplitude by an approximately constant factor scaling with contamination rate $f_c$. While this effect is negligible for the DESI ELG populations ($f_c=1\%$), the slitless-like errors, combining redshift uncertainty with $f_c=5\%$ catastrophics, introduce significant biases in cosmological constraints. For this case, shifts from $6\%$ to $16\%$ ($\sim2.2\sigma$ level) arise in estimating the fractional growth rate $df\equiv f/f^{\rm{fid}}$ and the log primordial amplitude $\ln(10^{10} A_{s})$. Applying a correction factor $(1-f_c)^2$ on the galaxy power spectrum mitigates the bias but weakens the parameter constraints due to new degeneracies. Alternatively, fixing $f_c$ to its expected value during fitting successfully restores the unbiased posterior without loss in constraint. Our results indicate that for space-based slitless surveys such as \textit{Euclid}, an accurate estimation of $f_c$ and its incorporation into the clustering model are essential to get unbiased cosmological constraints. Extending to evolving dark energy and massive neutrino cosmologies, we find that redshift errors do not bias the dark energy properties parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, but lead to slightly weaker constraints on $\sum m_\nu$.

#### X-ray polarization in radio-quiet AGN: Insights from the wedge corona model using Monte Carlo simulations

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we present novel calculations of X-ray polarization from radio-quiet and unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using the Monte Carlo code MONK, which includes all general and special relativity effects. Our geometric model, referred to as the ``wedge corona'', features a homogeneous cloud of electrons characterized by an aspect ratio of h/r and a radius that extends down to the innermost stable circular orbit around the central black hole (BH). Adopting the physical parameters of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151 as a baseline, we investigated various geometric and physical configurations of the BH-corona-accretion disk (AD) system, such as the coronal opening angle, temperature, optical depth, BH spin, and the inner radius of the disk. Finally, we compared our calculations with results from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) for NGC 4151, the only radio-quiet and unobscured AGN with significant polarization detected by IXPE, to constrain the system's geometric parameters within the framework of the wedge corona model.

 - **Abstract**
 The initial mass and metallicity of stars both have a strong impact on their fate. Stellar axial rotation also has a strong impact on the structure and evolution of massive stars. In this study, we exploit the large grid of GENEC models, covering initial masses from 9 to 500 $M_{\odot}$ and metallicities ranging from $Z=10^{-5}$ (nearly zero) to 0.02 (supersolar), to determine the impact of rotation on their fate across cosmic times. Using the carbon-oxygen core mass and envelope composition as indicators of their fate, we predict stellar remnants, supernova engines, and spectroscopic supernova types for both rotating and non-rotating stars. We derive rates of the different supernova and remnant types considering two initial mass functions to help solve puzzles such as the absence of observed pair-instability supernovae. We find that rotation significantly alters the remnant type and supernova engine, with rotating stars favouring black hole formation at lower initial masses than their non-rotating counterparts. Additionally, we confirm the expected strong metallicity dependence of the fates with a maximum black hole mass predicted to be below 50 $M_{\odot}$ at SMC or higher metallicities. A pair-instability mass gap is predicted between about 90 and 150 $M_{\odot}$, with the most massive black holes below the gap found at the lowest metallicities. Considering the fate of massive single stars has far-reaching consequences across many different fields within astrophysics, and understanding the impact of rotation and metallicity will improve our understanding of how massive stars end their lives, and their impact on the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Accreting massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) often display periodic variations in their emitted radiation, providing a distinctive signature for their identification. In this work, we explore the MBHBs identification via optical variability studies by simulating the observations of the LSST survey. To this end, we generate a population of MBHBs using the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model, focusing on systems with observed orbital periods $\leq$ 5 years. This ensures that at least two complete cycles of emission can be observed within the 10-year mission of LSST. To construct mock optical light curves, we first calculate the MBHB average magnitudes in each LSST filter by constructing a self-consistent SED that accounts for the binary accretion history and the emission from a circumbinary disc and mini-discs. We then add variability modulations by using six 3D hydrodynamic simulations of accreting MBHBs with different eccentricities and mass ratios as templates. To make the light curves realistic, we mimic the LSST observation patterns and cadence, and we include stochastic variability and LSST photometric errors. Our results show from $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-1}$ MBHBs per square degree, with light curves that are potentially detectable by LSST. These systems are mainly low-redshift ($z\lesssim1.5$), massive ($\gtrsim10^{7}\, M_{\odot}$), equal-mass (${\sim} 0.8$), relatively eccentric (${\sim}0.6$), and with modulation periods of around $3.5$ years. Using periodogram analysis, we find that LSST variability studies have a higher success rate ($>$50%) for systems with high eccentricities ($e>$0.6). Additionally, at fixed eccentricity, detections tend to favour systems with more unequal mass ratios. The false alarm probability shows similar trends. Circular binaries systematically feature high values ($\gtrsim 10^{-1}$). Eccentric systems have low-FAP tails, down to $\sim10^{-8}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the coronal geometry in different states of black hole X-ray binaries is important for more accurate modeling of the system. However, it is difficult to distinguish different geometries by fitting the observed Comptonization spectra. In this work, we use the Monte Carlo ray-tracing code MONK to simulate the spectra for three widely proposed coronal geometries: sandwich, spherical, and lamppost, varying their optical depth and size (height). By fitting the simulated NuSTAR observations with the simplcut*kerrbb model, we infer the possible parameter space for the hard state and soft state of different coronal geometries. The influence of the disk inclination angle and black hole spin is discussed. We find that for the lamppost model the disk emission is always dominant, making it incompatible in the hard state. While the sandwich and spherical models can produce similar spectra in both the hard and soft states, the simulated IXPE polarimetric spectra show the potential to break this degeneracy.

#### Refining fundamental constants with white dwarfs: machine learning informed constraints on fine-structure constant and proton-to-electron mass ratio

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21541

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the potential variation of two fundamental constants, the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and the proton-to-electron mass ratio $\mu$, within the framework of modified gravity theories and finite-temperature effects. Utilising high-precision white dwarf observations from the Gaia-DR3 survey, we construct a robust mass--radius relation using a Bayesian-inspired machine learning framework. This empirical relation is rigorously compared with theoretical predictions derived from scalar-tensor gravity models and temperature-dependent equations of state. Our results demonstrate that both underlying gravitational theory and temperature substantially influence the inferred constraints on $\alpha$ and $\mu$. We obtain the strongest constraints as $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|=2.10^{+32.56}_{-39.26}\times10^{-7}$ and $|\Delta\mu/\mu|=1.61^{+37.16}_{-34.67}\times10^{-7}$ for modified gravity parameter $\gamma\simeq -3.69\times10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$, while for the finite temperature case, these are $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|=1.60^{+37.31}_{-35.42}\times10^{-7}$ and $|\Delta\mu/\mu|=1.23^{+37.02}_{-35.71}\times10^{-7}$ for $T \simeq 1.1 \times 10^7\rm\, K$. These findings yield tighter constraints than those reported in earlier studies and underscore the critical roles of gravitational and thermal physics in testing the constancy of fundamental parameters.

#### Probing Picohertz Gravitational Waves with Pulsars

 - **Abstract**
 With periods much longer than the duration of current pulsar timing surveys, gravitational waves in the picohertz (pHz) regime are not detectable in the typical analysis framework for pulsar timing data. However, signatures of these low-frequency signals persist in the slow variation of pulsar timing parameters. In this work, we present the results of the first Bayesian search for continuous pHz gravitational waves using the drift of two sensitive pulsar timing parameters -- time derivative of pulsar binary orbital period $\dot{P}_b$ and second order time derivative of pulsar spin period $\ddot{P}$. We apply our new technique to a dataset with more than double the number of pulsars as previous searches in this frequency band, achieving an order-of-magnitude sensitivity improvement. No continuous wave signal is detected in current data; however, we show that future observations by the Square Kilometre Array will provide significantly improved sensitivity and the opportunity to observe continuous pHz signals, including the early stages of supermassive black hole mergers. We explore the detection prospects for this signal by extending existing population models into the pHz regime, finding that future observations will probe phenomenologically-interesting parameter space. Our new Bayesian technique and leading sensitivity in this frequency domain paves the way for new discoveries in both black hole astrophysics and the search for new physics in the early universe.

#### Investigating Little Red Dots with UV Excess: Are They the High-Redshift Siblings of Blue Hot DOGs?

 - **Abstract**
 Little Red Dots (LRDs), newly identified compact and dusty galaxies with an unexpectedly high number density observed by JWST, have an unusual "V-shaped" rest-frame UV to near-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED). A group of hyper-luminous, obscured quasars with excess blue emission, called Blue-excess Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (BHDs), also exhibit qualitatively similar SEDs to those of LRDs. They represent a rare population of galaxies hosting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) accreting near the Eddington limit at redshifts z \sim 1--4. In this study, we compare their multi-wavelength SEDs to investigate whether LRDs, or a subset of them, could be high-redshift analogs of BHDs. Our analysis reveals that despite their similar "V-shape" SEDs, LRDs appear to be a different population than BHDs. The "V-shape" of BHDs appear at longer wavelengths compared to LRDs due to different selection strategies, suggesting LRDs have much less dust attenuation than typical BHDs. The bluer colors in the rest-frame infrared (continuum) emission of LRDs suggest the absence of hot dust heated by AGN accretion activities. We also argue that the blue excess in LRDs is unlikely from AGN scattered light. The compact morphologies and lower X-ray detection frequencies of LRDs suggest a distinct formation pathway from BHDs -- which are thought to be powered by super-Eddington accretion onto central SMBHs following major galaxy mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries of faint active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the redshift frontier have revealed a plethora of broad \Halpha emitters with optically red continua, named Little Red Dots (LRDs), which comprise 15-30\% of the high redshift broad line AGN population. Due to their peculiar spectral properties and X-ray weakness, modeling LRDs with standard AGN templates has proven challenging. In particular, the validity of single-epoch virial mass estimates in determining the black hole (BH) masses of LRDs has been called into question, with some models claiming that masses might be overestimated by up to 2 orders of magnitude, and other models claiming that LRDs may be entirely stellar in nature. We report the direct, dynamical BH mass measurement in a strongly lensed LRD at $z = 7.04$. The combination of lensing with deep spectroscopic data reveals a rotation curve that is inconsistent with a nuclear star cluster, yet can be well explained by Keplerian rotation around a point mass of 50 million Solar masses, consistent with virial BH mass estimates from the Balmer lines. The Keplerian rotation leaves little room for any stellar component in a host galaxy, as we conservatively infer $M_{\rm BH}/M_{*}>2$. Such a ''naked'' black hole, together with its near-pristine environment, indicates that this LRD is a massive black hole seed caught in its earliest accretion phase.

 - **Abstract**
 With its third data release (DR3), Gaia begins unveiling dormant candidate compact object (CO) binaries with luminous companion (LC) as predicted by several past theoretical studies. To date, 3 black hole (BH), 21 neutron star (NS), and ~3200 white dwarf (WD) candidates have been identified with LCs in detached orbits using astrometry. We adopt an observationally motivated sampling scheme for the star formation history of the Milky Way, and initial zero-age main-sequence binary properties, incorporate all relevant binary interaction processes during evolution to obtain a realistic present-day intrinsic population of CO--LC binaries. We apply Gaia's selection criteria to identify the CO--LC binaries detectable using the observational cuts applicable for DR3 as well as its end-of-mission (EOM). We find that under the DR3 selection cuts, our detectable population includes no BH--LCs, approximately 10-40 NS--LCs, and around ~4300 WD--LCs. In contrast, by EOM, the expected numbers increase to 30-300 BH--LCs, 1500-5000 NS--LCs, and ~10^5-10^6 WD--LC binaries, primarily because of the significantly longer baseline of observation.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate strong gravitational lensing using magnetized Kerr black holes (MKBHs), which are accurate Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson solutions for Kerr black holes in a uniform magnetic field with additional magnetic field strength $B$ apart from mass $M$ and spin $a$. Unlike previous magnetized spacetimes, the MKBH geometry is Petrov type D, devoid of conical singularities, allowing photons to reach asymptotic infinity and making the concept astrophysically feasible. We use the strong deflection limit formalism to calculate the photon sphere radius, critical impact parameter, deflection angle, and lensing observables including the image position $\theta_\infty$, angular separation $s$ and relative magnification $r_{\text{mag}}$, as well as their relationships with the parameters $a$ and $B$. Our results reveal that the relativistic image's photon sphere and angular size increase with $B$, whereas lensing observables deviate significantly from the Kerr scenario. For M87*, with $a=0.9$, the angular position of relativistic images increases from $10.8~\mu$as (Kerr) to $12.02~\mu$as, and the time delay between the first two images increases from $158.5$ h to $176$ h at $B=0.4$. Similarly, for Sgr A*, the image position increases from $14.4~\mu$as to $16~\mu$as, with time delays enhanced by approximately $0.7$ minutes. The relative magnification $r_{\text{mag}}$ grows with $B$ and deviates by $0.53$ from Kerr black holes at $B=0.4$. Our findings highlight strong gravitational lensing as a powerful tool to probe the presence of magnetic fields around astrophysical black holes, and in particular, we demonstrate that the MKBH spacetime enables constraints on the parameters $a$ and $B$.

 In this work, we consider the logarithmic-corrected and the power-law corrected versions of the holographic dark energy (HDE) model in the non-flat FRW universe filled with a viscous Dark Energy (DE) interacting with Dark Matter (DM). We propose to replace the infra-red cut-off with the inverse of the Ricci scalar curvature $R$. We obtain the equation of state (EoS) parameter $\omega_{\Lambda}$, the deceleration parameter $q$ and the evolution of energy density parameter $\omega_{\Lambda} '$ in the presence of interaction between DE and DM for both corrections. We study the correspondence of the power-law entropy corrected Ricci dark energy (PLECRDE) and the logarithmic entropy corrected Ricci dark energy (LECRDE) models with the Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG), the Modified Variable Chaplygin Gas (MVCG), the New Modified Chaplygin Gas (NMCG), the Yang-Mills (YM) and the Non Linear Electro-Dynamics (NLED) scalar field models.

 - **Abstract**
 We present version 2.1 of the public code {\sc precession}, a Python module for studying the post-Newtonian dynamics of precessing black hole binaries. In this release, we extend the code to handle eccentric orbits. This extension leverages the existing numerical infrastructure wherever possible, introducing a semi-automatic method to adapt circular-orbit functions to the eccentric case via a Python decorator. Additional new features include orbit- and precession-averaged evolutionary equations for the eccentricity, as well as revised expressions to convert between post-Newtonian separation and gravitational-wave emission frequency.

 - **Abstract**
 The quantized area predicted by loop quantum gravity suggests the existence of a lower bound for black-hole horizons. We prove this intuition within a covariant effective model for spherical loop quantum gravity, where nonsingular quasi-static black holes evaporate until their horizons attain the smallest positive eigenvalue of the area operator. Consistent with the third law of black-hole thermodynamics, this final state -- characterized by vanishing temperature and entropy -- cannot be realized in finite time. The process thus leads to the formation of stable remnants, whose estimated masses are approximately 20.94$\mu$g, lying in the Planck regime.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the spherical harmonic mode amplitudes of quasi-circular, nonprecessing binary black hole mergers using 283 numerical relativity (NR) simulations from the SXS, RIT, and MAYA catalogs. We construct fits using the leading-order post-Newtonian (PN) dependence on intrinsic parameters, replacing the PN velocity with fit coefficients. We compare these to polynomial fits in symmetric mass ratio and spin. We analyze $(\ell, m)$ modes with $\ell \leq 4$ from late inspiral ($t = -500M$ relative to the $(2,2)$ peak) to post-merger ($t = 40M$). For nonspinning systems, the $(2,2)$, $(2,1)$, and $(3,3)$ modes retain the leading-order PN dependence on mass ratio throughout the merger. Higher-order modes deviate from the PN dependence only near and after the merger, where polynomial fits of degree $N \leq 3$ can capture the amplitude behavior up to $40M$. For aligned-spin systems at fixed mass ratio, the $(2,1)$ mode retains its PN spin dependence, while the $(3,2)$ and $(4,3)$ modes exhibit a quadratic spin dependence near merger. The PN-inspired fits lose accuracy with increasing mass ratio, particularly near merger. Results broadly agree across catalogs, though discrepancies appear in the $(3,1)$, $(4,2)$, and $(4,1)$ modes, likely from resolution differences. Our results clarify the extent to which PN structure persists in mode amplitudes and show that simple polynomial models can capture strong-field behavior near merger, enabling efficient and interpretable waveform modeling in this regime.

 - **Abstract**
 We carry out model independent analyses for global structures of spherically symmetric regular black holes that evaporate and approach the extremal state spending infinite periods of time due to Hawking radiation. We assume the radius of the outer apparent horizon (outer AH) to be a decreasing function of ingoing null coordinate, and consider the three cases, Cases 1, 2, and 3, where the radius of the inner AH is a constant, increases, and decreases, respectively. A complete classification of the Penrose diagrams is presented in each case, taking account not only of the presence and absence of the event horizon but also of the relative positions of the inner and outer AHs. Sufficient conditions that lead to each type are proved, and the examples of each type are summarized. We also study the behavior of outgoing null geodesics in models where the null geodesic equation is solvable, and figure out the important factors to determine the type of a spacetime using concepts in the area of dynamical systems. The formation of a Cauchy horizon is also established in the solvable models when the event horizon is present.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we introduce a novel framework to investigate ringdown gravitational waveforms in the presence of dynamical matter fields outside the horizon of a black hole. We systematically analyze two distinct scenarios of dynamical matter fields: motion along geodesics and uniform motion with constant velocity. Our results reveal rich phenomenology in the ringdown gravitational wave signals, including the suppression or enhancement of echoes, frequency shifts in the decay oscillations, and intricate modulations of the power-law tails. Notably, we demonstrate that subluminal moving potentials can produce irregular echo patterns and shift the dominant frequencies, offering potential new observational signatures beyond the already-known ringdown analyses. This study provides a new perspective for probing dynamic environments around black holes and offers a theoretical foundation for interpreting possible deviations in future gravitational wave detections.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the physical and observational features of static, spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes surrounded by anisotropic fluid and embedded in a plasma environment. Motivated by recent advances in black hole imaging and precision measurements in strong gravity, we explore light propagation, wave dynamics, and observational signatures in such geometries. We begin by analyzing the background spacetime and matter content, examining the horizon structure and verifying the energy conditions associated with the anisotropic fluid. We then study photon trajectories in both vacuum and plasma environments, deriving the equations of motion and computing deflection angles and image magnifications under weak gravitational lensing. Both uniform and power-law plasma profiles are considered to model realistic astrophysical settings. In the wave optics regime, we first analyze the linear stability of the spacetime under axial (odd-parity) perturbations using Chandrasekhar's method, and then investigate scalar field scattering by solving the wave equation in the curved background with plasma. Using Born and WKB approximations, we compute the differential scattering cross-sections and examine how anisotropy and plasma affect interference features. Finally, we perform parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to constrain the black hole mass and anisotropic fluid parameters, utilizing EHT and GRAVITY data for Sgr A* and EHT-only data for M87*. These results present a unified theoretical framework that links anisotropic matter effects with lensing and scattering observables providing a firm basis for future comparisons with high-resolution astrophysical data sets in diverse contexts.

 - **Abstract**
 This work explores the black hole information loss paradox, a fundamental challenge in theoretical physics. It proposes insights using Holographic Entanglement Entropy (HEE) and the AdS/BCFT correspondence within Horndeski gravity. The work revisits the time-dependent behavior of HEE to probe black hole interiors and examines its implications for the Page curve, which describes the entropy evolution of Hawking radiation. It also discusses the relationship between conformal field theory (CFT) microstates and black hole thermodynamics through the AdS/BCFT correspondence, suggesting that only a subset of microstates corresponds to black holes with smooth interiors, while others may involve firewalls. The study extends black hole thermal entropy to time-dependent entanglement entropy, offering a perspective on the interplay between quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and gravity.

#### $2$-split from Feynman diagrams and Expansions

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the $2$-split behavior of tree-level amplitudes of bi-adjoint scalar (BAS), Yang-Mills (YM), non-linear sigma model (NLSM), and general relativity (GR) theories under certain kinematic conditions. Our approach begins with a proof, based on the Feynman diagram method, of the $2$-split property for tree-level BAS$\oplus$X amplitudes with $\mathrm{X}={\mathrm{YM},\mathrm{NLSM},\mathrm{GR}}$. The proof relies crucially on a particular pattern in the Feynmam rules of various vertices. Building on this, we use the expansion of X amplitudes into BAS$\oplus$X amplitudes to establish the $2$-split behavior. As a byproduct, we derive universal expansions of the resulting pure X currents into BAS currents, which closely parallel the corresponding on-shell amplitude expansions.
