 - **Abstract**
 Ultracompact X-ray binaries (UCXBs) are a subclass of low-mass X-ray binaries characterized by tight orbits and degenerate donors, which pose significant challenges to our understanding of their formation. Recent discoveries of black hole (BH) candidates with main-sequence (MS) or red giant (RG) companions suggest that BH-white dwarf (BH-WD) binaries are common in the Galactic field. Motivated by these observations and the fact that most massive stars are born in triples, we show that wide BH-WD systems can naturally form UCXBs through the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. Notably, EKL-driven eccentricity excitations combined with gravitational wave (GW) emission and WD dynamical tides can effectively shrink and circularize the orbit, leading to mass-transferring BH-WD binaries. These systems represent promising multimessenger sources in both X-ray and GW observations. Specifically, we predict that the wide triple channel can produce $\sim5-45$ ($\sim1-8$) detectable UCXBs in the Milky Way (Andromeda galaxy), including $\sim1$ system observable by the mHz GW detection of LISA. If the final WD mass can reach sufficiently small values, this channel could contribute up to $\sim 10^3$ UCXBs in the Galaxy. Furthermore, the identification of tertiary companions in observed UCXBs would provide direct evidence for this formation pathway and yield unique insights into their dynamical origins.

 - **Abstract**
 Many applications in transient science, gravitational wave follow-up, and galaxy population studies require all-sky galaxy catalogs with reliable distances, extents, and stellar masses. However, existing catalogs often lack completeness beyond $\sim 100$ Mpc, suffer from stellar contamination, or do not provide homogeneous stellar mass estimates and size information. Our goal is to build a high-purity, high-completeness, all-sky galaxy catalog out to 2,000 Mpc, specifically designed to support time-domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. We combined major galaxy catalogs and deep imaging surveys -- including the Legacy Surveys, Pan-STARRS, DELVE, and SDSS -- and added spectroscopic, photometric, and redshift-independent distances. We cleaned the sample using the Gaia catalog to remove stars, and visually inspected all ambiguous cases below 100 Mpc through a classification platform that gathered 20,000 expert votes. Stellar masses were estimated using optical and mid-infrared profile-fit photometry, and we improved the accuracy of photometric distances by combining multiple independent estimates. The resulting catalog, REGALADE, includes nearly 80 million galaxies with distances under 2,000 Mpc. It provides stellar masses for 88\% of the sample and ellipse fits for 80\%. REGALADE is more than 90\% complete for massive galaxies out to 360 Mpc. In science tests, it recovers 60\% more known supernova hosts, doubles the number of low-luminosity transient hosts, and identifies more reliable hosts for ultraluminous and hyperluminous X-ray sources. REGALADE is the most complete and reliable all-sky galaxy catalog to date for the nearby Universe, built for real-world applications in transient and multi-messenger astrophysics. The full dataset, visual classifications, and code will be released to support broad community use.

#### Effects of Dissipation Physics on High-frequency Quasi-periodic Oscillations in Black Hole X-ray Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 We numerically investigate the effects of black hole spin and local dissipation profiles on high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (HFQPO) observed in black hole X-ray binaries (BHXB). Our HFQPO power spectra arise from self-consistent calculations that do not rely on ad-hoc assumptions regarding disk geometry. Our models combine radiative transfer and disk vertical structure equations with input motivated by first-principles three-dimensional simulations. We found that HFQPO power spectra may be sensitive to spatial distribution of dissipation rates while the quality factors are more sensitive to black hole spin. We discuss the observational implications of our results in context of steep power law (SPL) spectra from BHXBs that are seen together with HFQPOs, and how QPO properties may be indicators of the underlying physical oscillations.

#### Constraints on Compact Dark Matter Population from Micro-lensing Effect of Gravitational Wave for the third-generation gravitational Wave Detector

 - **Abstract**
 Since the pioneering detection of gravitational wave (GW) from a binary black hole merger by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, GW has become a powerful tool for probing astrophysics and cosmology. If compact dark matter (DM) candidates, e.g. primordial black holes, contribute a substantial fraction of the DM component across a broad mass spectrum, their gravitational influence would imprint distinctive micro-lensing signatures on long-wavelength GW signals. In this paper, we propose a systematic method ranging from simulating micro-lensing GWs to constraining population information of compact DM, combining future third-generation ground-based GW detector, i.e. Einstein Telescope, with a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework. This approach enables us to analyze micro-lensing signatures in GW events and probe the potential contribution of compact DM objects to the DM budget of universe. For a population with a power-law mass function, we demonstrate that detecting 8 micro-lensing GW events out of $10^4$ observed binary black holes would constrain the compact DM abundance to $\log_{10}(f_{\rm CO})=-2.76^{+0.16}_{-0.17}$.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar mass is the most fundamental property of a galaxy. While it has been robustly measured for millions of external galaxies, it remains poorly constrained for the Milky Way because of the strong selection effect from our inside perspective. In this work, we reconstruct the intrinsic vertical mass density profile in the solar neighborhood and the radial mass density profile across the entire Galaxy using data from the Gaia and APOGEE surveys, following careful correction for the selection function. The local density profile exhibits strong north-south asymmetry in the geometric thick disk regime and increases steeply toward the disk mid-plane, favoring an exponential model over the sech$^2$ model. Integrating the local vertical density profile yields a surface stellar mass density of 31.563$\pm$2.813(syst.)$\pm$0.024(stoch.)~${\rm M_{\odot}pc^{-2}}$, of which 25.074 and 6.489~${\rm M_{\odot}pc^{-2}}$ correspond to living stars and stellar remnants, respectively. The radial surface mass density profile {of the Milky Way} shares the same flat inner component as observed in the brightness profile. With this mass density profile {and local mass density from Gaia}, we derive a new estimate of the total stellar mass of the Milky Way of 2.607$\pm$0.353(syst.)$\pm$0.085(stoch.)${\rm \times10^{10}M_{\odot}}$, a factor of two lower than the previous results. This discrepancy arises primarily from the inner disk profile, which was previously unavailable and extrapolated from the outer disk profile. The lower stellar mass estimate of the Milky Way significantly reduces its rarity in terms of supermassive black hole mass among external galaxies and implies a larger dark matter-to-baryon mass ratio in the inner Galaxy.

#### Is Phantom Barrier Crossing Inevitable? A Cosmographic Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of dark energy using a model-independent framework based on the cosmographic approach. The main objective of this work is to construct a dynamical dark energy model directly from the kinematic equations of the cosmographic parameters, rather than adopting any arbitrary parametrization of the cosmological parameters. We employ the differential equation for the jerk parameter and map it to an anharmonic oscillator equation. From this, we derive an analytical expression for the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy. Interestingly, this form of the EoS depends on only a single parameter. Using the recently released DESI DR2 BAO data, Pantheon+ supernova dataset, and a compressed Planck likelihood, we constrain the cosmological parameters within this framework. Our results indicate a deviation from the cosmological constant behavior at late times, suggesting a dynamical nature of dark energy. Our findings contradict the DESI DR2 analysis based on the CPL parametrization, as no phantom-barrier crossing is observed in our analysis. This study highlights that model-independent reconstructions rooted in kinematical quantities can provide robust insights into the true nature of dark energy.

#### Binary stars in the Milky Way nuclear stellar cluster

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate-mass galaxies, including the Milky Way, typically host both a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and a nuclear stellar cluster (NSC). Binaries in an NSC evolve via close encounters with surrounding stars and secular processes related to the SMBH. We study moderately soft and hard binaries ($0.03$-$2.5\,\mathrm{au}$, $M \lesssim 2\,M_\odot$) initially at galactocentric radii 0.1 and 0.3 pc using three-body simulations including von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations and tidal dissipation over $\sim 10$ Gyr. Binaries migrate both inward and outward as a consequence of kicks received in the three-body encounters. Inward migration leads to destruction via mergers and evaporation, while outward migration is a pathway to retaining intact binaries for $\gtrsim 10$ Gyr. All surviving binaries are hard and circular, but outcomes for binaries initially at the hard-soft boundary are stochastic. We find that: (i) about $0.3$ percent of evaporated binaries fall into the SMBH's loss cone, (ii) at least $1$ percent of mergers occur late enough to appear as blue straggler stars (BSSs) on the main sequence or as recently evolved red giants, (iii) about $1$ percent of binaries initially at 0.1 pc merge within the inner arcsec of the NSC, and (iv) less than about $80$ percent of field-star collisions with a binary star lead to a subsequent merger; a three-body pile up, which are relatively common in the first 1-2 Gyr and could serve as a way to form more massive BSSs in the NSC. We predict that a small fraction of binaries originate closer to the SMBH than their present-day orbits, and vice versa for evaporated binaries and BSSs. The mergers confined to the inner arcsec occur after $\gtrsim 300$ Myr, too long to be directly related to the formation of the S-stars or G-objects, but suggest that the inner arcsec is contaminated with BSSs from earlier star formation events.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a cosmological analysis of the third-order aperture mass statistic using Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) data. We perform a complete tomographic measurement of the three-point correlation function of the Y3 weak lensing shape catalog with the four fiducial source redshift bins. Building upon our companion methodology paper, we apply a pipeline that combines the two-point function $\xi_{\pm}$ with the mass aperture skewness statistic $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$, which is an efficient compression of the full shear three-point function. We use a suite of simulated shear maps to obtain a joint covariance matrix. By jointly analyzing $\xi_\pm$ and $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ measured from DES Y3 data with a $\Lambda$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.780\pm0.015$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.266^{+0.039}_{-0.040}$, yielding 111% of figure-of-merit improvement in $\Omega_m$-$S_8$ plane relative to $\xi_{\pm}$ alone, consistent with expectations from simulated likelihood analyses. With a $w$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.749^{+0.027}_{-0.026}$ and $w_0=-1.39\pm 0.31$, which gives an improvement of $22\%$ on the joint $S_8$-$w_0$ constraint. Our results are consistent with $w_0=-1$. Our new constraints are compared to CMB data from the Planck satellite, and we find that with the inclusion of $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ the existing tension between the data sets is at the level of $2.3\sigma$. We show that the third-order statistic enables us to self-calibrate the mean photometric redshift uncertainty parameter of the highest redshift bin with little degradation in the figure of merit. Our results demonstrate the constraining power of higher-order lensing statistics and establish $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ as a practical observable for joint analyses in current and future surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first proof of the reverse isoperimetric inequality for black holes in arbitrary dimension using a two-pronged geometric-analytic approach. The proof holds for compact Riemannian hypersurfaces in AdS space and seems to be a generic property of black holes in the extended phase space formalism. Using Euclidean gravitational action, we show that, among all hypersurfaces of given volume, the round sphere in the $D$-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space maximizes the area (and hence the entropy). This analytic result is supported by a geometric argument in a $1+1+2$ decomposition of spacetime: gravitational focusing enforces a strictly negative conformal deformation, and the Sherif-Dunsby rigidity theorem then forces the deformed 3-sphere to be isometric to the round 3-sphere, establishing the round sphere as the extremal surface, in fact, a maximally entropic surface. Our work establishes that the reversal of the usual isoperimetric inequality occurs due to the structure of the curved background governed by Einstein's equation, underscoring the role of gravity in the reverse isoperimetric inequality for black hole horizons in AdS space.

#### Modified cosmology through generalized mass-to-horizon entropy: observational constraints from DESI DR2 BAO data

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13260

 - **Abstract**
 A generalized mass-to-horizon entropy has recently been proposed as an extension of the Bekenstein-Hawking area law, derived from a modified mass-horizon relation constructed to ensure consistency with the Clausius equation. Within the gravity-thermodynamics conjecture, this entropy formulation yields modified Friedmann equations, which recover the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology in the appropriate limit of the model's two free parameters. In the present study, we constrain this framework using observations from TypeIa supernovae (SNIa), cosmic chronometers (CC) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO, including DESI~DR2), together with the SH0ES distance-ladder prior on $H_0$, across four combinations of data sets. Although the extended entropic scenario yields a slightly better, or statistically comparable, fit to the data, model selection via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) mildly favors the cosmological constant as the dark energy candidate. Moreover, the $\Lambda$CDM limit lies within $\sim 1\sigma$ of our constraints, indicating no significant deviation from standard cosmology with current data.

#### Listening to black mirrors with gravitational radiation

 - **Abstract**
 The existence of curvature singularities and the information and firewall paradoxes are significant problems for the conventional black hole model. The black mirror hypothesis provides a CPT-symmetric alternative to the classical description of black hole, offering a novel solution to these long-standing issues. We show that classical black holes can, in principle, be distinguished from black mirrors observationally, by using gravitational waves. The principal challenge is to identify a unique, testable signature of the black mirror's reflective horizon that can be detected by current or future observatories. The horizon singularity of the black mirror model necessitates that no energy flux is propagated beyond the horizon, which can be described effectively by imposing specific boundary conditions at the event horizon. Our analysis demonstrates that the quasi-normal mode spectrum of the black mirror is fundamentally different from that of classical black holes, as purely ingoing modes are forbidden. Moreover, we show that the reflectivity of the black mirror does not depend on any free parameter; it is given precisely by the Boltzmann factor, which is independent of the dissipation parameter, indicating a universal behaviour regardless of the specific underlying quantum dynamics at the horizon. A definitive detection of the predicted gravitational wave echoes would provide compelling evidence distinguishing the reflective boundary of a black mirror from the perfectly absorbing horizon of a classical black hole. Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are ideal probes for this test, as their long-duration signals allow for the secular accumulation of these faint echoes, offering a concrete pathway to challenge the classical paradigm and revolutionise our understanding of spacetime.

#### Compact stars in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity: regular and divergent scalar field configurations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13273

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate static, spherically symmetric solutions in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity non-minimally coupled to a massless real scalar field, both in vacuum and in the presence of fermionic matter. Focusing on a specific quadratic scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling, we identify two distinct classes of compact objects: one with a regular scalar field at the origin -- connected to general relativity in an appropriate limit -- and another {one} with a divergent scalar field at the origin but a regular geometry. We analyze both purely scalar and matter-supported (hybrid) configurations, showing that the former can describe a broad class of compact objects, while the latter can reproduce neutron star-like masses even when modeled with a simple polytropic equation of state. Furthermore, we highlight distinctive phenomenological signatures, including the ability of these stars to exceed known compactness limits and their potential to act as gravitational wave super-emitters. We also examined the motion of test particles non-minimally coupled to the scalar field and showed the existence of stable circular orbits within the Schwarzschild's ISCO and static configurations at finite radii for particles with zero angular momentum.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravity in nonlinear and dynamical regimes underpins spectacular astrophysical phenomena and observable consequences, from the early universe to black hole collisions. In these extreme environments, inverse energy cascades - mediated by nonlinear interactions - may help explain the near scale-invariance of cosmic structure and the simplicity of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Yet the presence, characteristics, and generality of such interactions in full General Relativity remain largely unexplored. Here we show that two types of nonlinear interactions - a four-mode and a three-mode interaction - emerge in the fully nonlinear regime, and can indeed channel inverse energy cascades by inducing resonant and anti-damping instabilities. This establishes what was previously only hinted at in highly specialized perturbative contexts. We further demonstrate a ``laminar'' to ``turbulent'' transition for the largest-possible angular structure in General Relativity, whereas finer structures remain persistently turbulent. Our results reveal the impact and generality of these nonlinear interactions (instabilities), which can be key to understanding observations ranging from cosmological to kilometer scales. We anticipate that our work will shed new light on nonlinear gravitational phenomena and their consequences, such as constructing gravitational wave templates and testing General Relativity in the most extreme regime. Moreover, our work is a starting point for addressing nonlinear gravitational interactions using ideas and methods inspired by fluid dynamics.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13341

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the shadow properties of the Kerr-Newman-Anti-de Sitter black hole coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics. We construct the shadow by employing the celestial coordinate approach for observers located at finite distances, accounting for the non-asymptotically flat nature of the spacetime. The size, distortion, area, and oblateness of the shadow are analyzed in terms of the black hole parameters, including the spin, effective charge, and nonlinearity parameter. We further explore observational constraints using the Event Horizon Telescope results for M87* and Sgr~A*. The angular diameters inferred from the observed images allow us to bound the parameter space of the model, showing that both spin and nonlinearity play key roles in shaping the shadow and in restricting the effective charge. Additionally, we examine the energy emission rate derived from the shadow radius and Hawking temperature, highlighting the influence of rotation and nonlinear electrodynamics on black hole evaporation. Our results demonstrate that the black hole model provides a physically consistent and observationally viable extension of the standard Kerr paradigm, with potential implications for near-horizon quantum processes and tests of gravity beyond general relativity.

#### Long-lived quasinormal modes in the Euler-Heisenberg electrodynamics

 - **Abstract**
 Using the precise Leaver method and time-domain integration, we analyze the quasinormal modes and late-time behavior of massive neutral and charged scalar fields in the background of a charged, asymptotically flat black hole in the presence of Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamics. We show that as the field mass increases, the damping rate decreases significantly, approaching arbitrarily long-lived states known as quasi-resonances. However, these modes cannot be identified in time-domain profiles due to the dominance of asymptotic tails in this regime, which decay slowly and exhibit oscillations with a power-law envelope. We observe that a larger field charge leads to a significantly higher quality factor, as it increases the oscillation frequency while reducing the damping rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Advancements in the sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors have increased the detection rate of transient astrophysical signals. We improve the existing BayesWave initialization algorithm and present a rapid, low-latency approximate maximum likelihood solution for reconstructing non-Gaussian features. We include three enhancements: (1) using a modified wavelet basis to eliminate redundant inner product calculations; (2) shifting from traditional time-frequency-quality factor (TFQ) wavelet transforms to time-frequency-time extent (TF$\tau$) transforms to optimize wavelet subtractions; and (3) implementing a downsampled heterodyned wavelet transform to accelerate initial calculations. Our model can be used to de-noise long-duration signals, which include the stochastic gravitational-wave background from numerous unresolved sources and continuous wave signals from isolated sources such as rotating neutron stars. Through our model, we can also aid machine learning applications that aim to classify and understand glitches by providing non-whitened, time and frequency domain, Gaussian-noise-free reconstructions of any glitch.

#### Effects of non-minimal scalar field couplings with curvature tensors on perturbations in non-commutative Schwarzschild spacetimes

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents a comparative analysis of the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of scalar field perturbations in the non-commutative Schwarzschild black hole spacetime, focusing on two different non-minimal curvature couplings: in the first case the scalar field is coupled to the Ricciscalar while in the second the field's derivatives are coupled to the Einstein tensor. These couplings are important in the cosmological modified gravity models and low energy effects of perturbative quantum gravity. It is shown that though the QNM spectra in two models are approximately the same at low overtone numbers, particularly at fundamental modes, they behave characteristically at higher overtones. Time-domain profiles confirm that while the decay rates are predominantly controlled by the near-horizon physics, the oscillation frequencies distinctly reflect the nature of the curvature couplings. In brief, the kind of scalar-interaction affects the spectral and dynamical characteristics of perturbations especially in the high-frequency regime.

 - **Abstract**
 A scalar ultralight dark matter (ULDM) candidate would induce oscillatory motion of freely falling test masses via its coupling to Standard Model fields. Such oscillations would create an observable Doppler shift of light exchanged between the test masses, and in particular would be visible in space-based gravitational waves (GW) detectors, such as LISA. While this kind of detection has been proposed multiple times in the recent years, we numerically investigate if it is possible to extract a scalar ULDM signal in a space-based GW detector, and in particular how to differentiate such a signal from a GW signal. Using one year of realistic orbits for the LISA spacecrafts and Bayesian methods, we find that LISA will indeed be able to discriminate between the two signals.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from an all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive binary black holes using the third data release (DR3) of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA). Even though we recover a common-spectrum stochastic process, potentially induced by a nanohertz gravitational wave background, we find no evidence of continuous waves. Therefore, we place upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude: in the most sensitive frequency range around 10 nHz, we obtain a sky-averaged 95\% credibility upper limit of $\approx 7 \times 10^{-15}$. Our search is sensitive to supermassive binary black holes with a chirp mass of $\geq 10^9M_{\odot}$ up to a luminosity distance of 50 Mpc for our least sensitive sky direction and 200 Mpc for the most sensitive direction. This work provides at least 4 times better sensitivity in the 1-200 nHz frequency band than our last search based on the PPTA's first data release. We expect that PPTA will continue to play a key role in detecting continuous gravitational waves in the exciting era of nanohertz gravitational wave astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we perform small perturbations around the circular timelike orbit in the equatorial plane of the Horndeski rotating black hole, and analyze the effects of Horndeski hair on the three fundamental frequencies of the epicyclic oscillations. Since this operation can model the quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) phenomena of the surrounding accretion disc, we then employ the MCMC simulation to fit the theoretical results with three QPO events, including GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859+226 and H1743-322, and constrain the characteristic radius $r$, black hole mass $M$ and spinning parameter $a$, and the Horndeski hair parameter $h$. Our constraint on the Horndeski hair parameter is much tighter than QPOs simulation from the existed accretion models, suggesting slight deviation from classical Kerr black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article we extend the Horizon Brightened Acceleration Radiation (HBAR) framework to the causal diamond (CD) spacetime. We study a cloud of two-level atoms, injected at random times in the asymptotic past of the CD, freely falling toward its causal horizon and emitting scalar radiation via a weak dipole coupling to a quantum field. In the near-horizon region, an emergent conformal symmetry-captured by conformal quantum mechanics (CQM)-governs the field dynamics and allows analytic control of the emission process. We find that the radiation spectrum is thermal, with temperature $T_D = 1/(\pi\alpha)$, and that the associated von Neumann entropy flux reproduces the entropy production of the radiation field. These results demonstrate that the causal horizons of the CD spacetime effectively act as a topological thermal reservoir, with thermal properties arising entirely from the global causal structure rather than from underlying microscopic degrees of freedom, highlighting that the validity of the HBAR framework is fundamentally tied to the existence of causal horizons, independent of the presence of a black hole.

#### Regular AdS$_3$ black holes from regularized Gauss-Bonnet coupling

 - **Abstract**
 We obtain a three-dimensional bi-vector-tensor theory of the generalized Proca class by regularizing the Gauss-Bonnet invariant within the Weyl geometry. We show that the theory admits a regular AdS$_3$ black hole solution with primary hairs. Introducing a deformation in the theory, a different regular AdS$_3$ black hole solution is obtained. Charged generalizations of these solutions are given by coupling to Born-Infeld electrodynamics.
