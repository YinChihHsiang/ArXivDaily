#### Controlled Tension Forecasting: Quantifying Cross-Probe Biases in $ω_0ω_a$CDM

 - **Abstract**
 Recent analyses combining DESI DR2 BAO, Planck CMB, and Pantheon+ SNe have reported mild but intriguing deviations from the LambdaCDM model. A central challenge is to determine whether these deviations reflect genuine dynamical dark energy behavior or instead arise from cross-probe inconsistencies, prior choices, or mismatches in likelihood construction. Previous work demonstrated that imposing a biased supernova-motivated prior on Omega_{m0} can artificially displace the BAO-inferred w_0,w_a values from the LambdaCDM expectation. A complementary pedagogic study further showed that the differing degeneracy geometries of BAO, CMB, and SNe can generate apparent dark energy evolution even when the underlying cosmology is exactly LambdaCDM. In this manuscript, we develop a controlled tension injection framework that provides a systematic means of quantifying how probe-level tensions influence inferred dark energy parameters. Self-consistent BAO, CMB, and SNe mock datasets are augmented with parameterized shifts in (Omega_{m0}, H_0), supernova absolute calibration, and the BAO sound-horizon scale $r_d$. The resulting datasets are analyzed through a unified MCMC pipeline, enabling a direct assessment of how these controlled tensions propagate into biases in (w_0, w_a) and the pivot equation-of-state parameter w_p. This forecasting framework provides practical guidance for identifying probe combinations that are most susceptible to spurious signatures of dynamical dark energy, and helps ensure robust multi-probe inference in forthcoming precision surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is slated to observe nearly 20 billion galaxies during its decade-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time. The rich imaging data it collects will be an invaluable resource for probing galaxy evolution across cosmic time, characterizing the host galaxies of transient phenomena, and identifying novel populations of anomalous systems. While machine learning models have shown promise for extracting galaxy features from multi-band astronomical imaging, the large dimensionality of the learned latent space presents a challenge for mechanistic interpretability studies. In this work, we present Minuet, a low-dimensional diffusion autoencoder for multi-band galaxy imaging. Minuet is trained to reconstruct 72x72-pixel $grz$ image cutouts of 6M galaxies within $z<1$ from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey using only five latent dimensions. By using a diffusion model conditioned on the transformer-based autoencoder's output for image reconstruction, we achieve semantically-meaningful latent representations of galaxy images while still allowing for high-fidelity, probabilistic reconstructions. We train a series of binary classifiers on Minuet's latent features to quantify their connection to morphological labels from Galaxy Zoo, and a conditional flow to produce posterior distributions of SED-derived redshifts, stellar masses, and star-formation rates. We further show the value of Minuet for nearest neighbor searches in the learned latent space. Minuet provides strong evidence for the low intrinsic dimensionality of galaxy imaging, and introduces a class of astrophysical models that produce highly compact representations for diverse science goals.

#### The DREAMS Project: Disentangling the Impact of Halo-to-Halo Variance and Baryonic Feedback on Milky Way Dark Matter Speed Distributions

 - **Abstract**
 Direct detection experiments require information about the local dark matter speed distribution to produce constraints on dark matter candidates, or infer their properties in the event of a discovery. In this paper, we analyze how the uncertainty in the dark matter speed distribution near the Sun is affected by baryonic feedback, halo-to-halo variance, and halo mass. To do so, we harness the statistical power of the new DREAMS Cold Dark Matter simulation suite, which is comprised of 1024 zoom-in Milky Way-mass halos with varied initial conditions as well as cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Applying a normalizing flows emulator to these simulations, we find that the uncertainty in the local DM speed distribution is dominated by halo-to-halo variance and, to a lesser extent, uncertainty in host halo mass. Uncertainties in supernova and black hole feedback (from the IllustrisTNG model in this case) are negligible in comparison. Using the DREAMS suite, we present a state-of-the-art prediction for the DM speed distribution in the Milky Way. Although the Standard Halo Model is contained within the uncertainty of this prediction, individual galaxies may have distributions that differ from it. Lastly, we apply our DREAMS results to the XENON1T experiment and demonstrate that the astrophysical uncertainties are comparable to the experimental ones, solidifying previous results in the literature obtained with a smaller sample of simulated Milky Way-mass halos.

 - **Abstract**
 We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of a candidate runaway supermassive black hole at the tip of a 62 kpc-long linear feature at z=0.96. The JWST data show a sharp kinematic discontinuity at the tip, with a radial velocity change of $\approx 600$ km/s across 0.1'' (1 kpc). The velocity gradient, together with the projected post-shock flow velocity of $\approx 300$ km/s, is well described by a simple shock-compression model of a supersonic object, with a velocity of $v_{BH} = 954^{+110}_{-126}$ km/s and an inclination $i=29^{+6}_{-3}$ deg. The previously puzzling kinematics along the linear feature, with the observed radial velocity decreasing from $\approx 300$ km/s near the tip to $\approx 100$ km/s closer to the former host galaxy, are naturally explained as gradual downstream mixing of shocked gas with the circumgalactic medium through turbulent entrainment. The runaway black hole interpretation is further supported by the morphology of the gas at the tip of the wake and an analysis of the [OIII]/H$\alpha$, [NII]/H$\alpha$, [SII]/H$\alpha$, and [SIII]/[SII] line ratios. The line ratios are consistent with fast radiative shocks and rapid cooling, with best-fit shock velocities that are in good agreement with expectations from the black hole velocity and the shock geometry. Energy conservation over the lifetime of the wake suggests a SMBH mass of $M_{BH} \gtrsim 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$. These results confirm that the wake is powered by a supersonic runaway supermassive black hole, a long-predicted consequence of gravitational-wave recoil or multi-body ejection from galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse black-hole scaling relations at the high-mass end, focusing in particular on the regime of ultra-massive black holes, $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{BH} > 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ (UMBHs). In a sample of 16 Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) without previous black-hole mass measurements we discover 8 UMBHs based on direct dynamical detections with triaxial Schwarzschild models. This first sample of triaxial black-hole mass determinations increases the number of known UMBHs by a factor of two and dramatically increases the constraints for BH mass scaling relations at the high-mass end. We find that BCGs are outliers in the canonical BH - $\sigma$ relation, while the size of their depleted cores - the central light-deficient region - is a much better unbiased predictor of the black hole mass and should be used as a proxy at the high-mass end. BCGs smoothly join the trend already established for massive core galaxies in previous studies. This also holds for tight correlations between core size and sphere-of-influence radius and core size and core density. All these relations strongly support the black-hole binary model for the formation of the centers of the most massive galaxies.

#### Primordial Black Holes from Inflation with a Spectator Field

 - **Abstract**
 How is the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) in single-field models of inflation impacted by the presence of additional scalar fields? We consider the effect of a spectator field - a free scalar field with sub-Hubble mass, no direct coupling to the inflaton, and which makes a subdominant contribution to the total energy density - in the context of single-field models of inflation featuring a transient phase of ultra-slow roll (USR) evolution. Despite the modest title, a spectator field can have a dramatic impact: the slow-roll evolution of the spectator prevents the combined inflaton-and-spectator system from entering into USR, which naively might be expected to preclude the production of PBHs. However, we demonstrate that the growth of perturbations is maintained or enhanced by the spectator, through the rich interplay of curvature and isocurvature perturbations. We show in a model-independent way that the single-field phase of ultra-slow-roll is replaced by two turns in field space encompassing a phase of tachyonic instability for the isocurvature perturbations and a transfer of power from isocurvature to curvature modes. Furthermore, we highlight a degeneracy between the fine-tuning of the feature in the inflaton potential and the parameters of the spectator, leading to an overall resilience of model predictions to parameter variations. This makes it easier for the underlying PBH model to accommodate both high-precision CMB constraints and production of PBHs in the asteroid-mass range.

 - **Abstract**
 Feedback from active supermassive black holes alters the distribution of matter in the Universe by injecting energy in the neighbouring hot gaseous medium, which leads to ejection of gas from the halos of galaxy groups and massive galaxies. Recent cosmological simulations such as FLAMINGO calibrate their feedback model on the baryon fractions of galaxy groups to tune the efficiency of gas ejection. However, recent observational constraints from optically selected groups and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect yield lower baryon fractions than previous studies, which indicates that feedback may be more ejective than previously thought. Here we show that models involving highly ejective feedback are inconsistent with the scaling relations of local galaxy groups in the mass range $10^{13}-10^{14}M_\odot$. We study the X-ray luminosity-temperature relation in a sample of 44 galaxy groups with high-quality XMM-Newton observations. We show that highly ejective models under-predict the luminosity of galaxy groups at fixed mass at high significance ($5.7\sigma$). This conclusion is robust against selection effects and is obtained from directly measurable and minimally correlated quantities. We point out that turning observable quantities into gas fraction estimates is challenging, especially in the context of stacking large samples of heterogeneous systems. We argue that calibrating feedback models on baryon fractions is prone to systematic uncertainties and that observable scaling relations are better suited for this task.

#### A Black-Hole Envelope Interpretation for Cosmological Demographics of Little Red Dots

 - **Abstract**
 Little red dots (LRDs) newly discovered with JWST are active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may represent black hole (BH) growth at the earliest cosmic epochs. These sources show puzzling features unlike typical AGNs, including red optical continua, weak hot-dust emission, and a lack of detectable X-rays. Previously, LRDs have often been interpreted as dust-reddened AGNs, leading to severe inconsistencies with the luminosity and BH mass densities inferred for previously known AGNs over $0<z<5$. The BH-envelope (BHE) model has been proposed to explain these characteristics, in which an accreting BH is enshrouded by a dense, optically thick gaseous envelope. In this Letter, we reanalyze the SEDs of $\sim 400$ photometric LRDs in the COSMOS-Web survey using the BHE model and reassess their implications for cosmological BH evolution. We find that the optical-NIR spectra of LRDs are well reproduced by blackbody emission with an effective temperatures of $4000-6000~\K$. Within the BHE framework, the inferred bolometric luminosities decrease by $\gtrsim1-2$ orders of magnitude compared to dust-reddened AGN assumptions. As a result, the revised luminosity function, BH accretion density, and BH mass function become consistent with those of AGNs at $z<5$. The stellar masses of LRD hosts are estimated by attributing the UV excesses to star formation. Although the resulting $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratio remains higher than the local empirical value, the excess is modest. Overall, the BHE model not only resolves the spectral features of LRDs but also brings their statistical properties into agreement with the broader cosmological BH population.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmology from weak gravitational lensing has been limited by astrophysical uncertainties in baryonic feedback and intrinsic alignments. By calibrating these effects using external data, we recover non-linear information, achieving a 2% constraint on the clustering amplitude, $S_8$, resulting in a factor of two improvement on the $\Lambda$CDM constraints relative to the fiducial Dark Energy Survey Year 3 model. The posterior, $S_8=0.832^{+0.013}_{-0.017}$, shifts by $1.5\sigma$ to higher values, in closer agreement with the cosmic microwave background result for the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our approach uses a star-forming 'blue' galaxy sample with intrinsic alignment model parameters calibrated by direct spectroscopic measurements, together with a baryonic feedback model informed by observations of X-ray gas fractions and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect profiles that span a wide range in halo mass and redshift. Our results provide a blueprint for next-generation surveys: leveraging galaxy properties to control intrinsic alignments and external gas probes to calibrate feedback, unlocking a substantial improvement in the precision of weak lensing surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Models of cosmic inflation generically predict a weak but potentially detectable amount of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), which can be used to obtain insights into the degrees of freedom during inflation and their interactions. The simplest types of PNG are the local and non-local (equilateral and orthogonal) shapes of the primordial three-point correlators, which are predicted by models with multiple light fields and derivative interactions in single-field inflation, respectively. In this paper we place constraints on local, equilateral, and orthogonal non-Gaussianities using the power spectrum and bispectrum extracted from first public release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our analysis makes use of higher-order clustering information through a consistent effective field theory (EFT) model for both the power spectrum and bispectrum at one-loop order. Using robust scale cuts where the EFT description is valid, we find the following constraints on PNG amplitudes: $f^{\rm loc}_{\rm NL}=-0.1\pm 7.4$, $f^{\rm equil}_{\rm NL}=719\pm 390$, $f^{\rm orth}_{\rm NL}=-200\pm 100$ (at $68\%$ CL). Non-local PNG constraints can be further improved by combining high-redshift DESI with legacy BOSS data and using simulation-based priors on bias parameters, yielding the strongest large-scale structure constraints to date $f^{\rm equil}_{\rm NL}=200\pm 230$, $f^{\rm orth}_{\rm NL}=-24\pm 86$. Our constraint on $f^{\rm loc}_{\rm NL}$ is competitive with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) limit; the combination gives $f^{\rm loc}_{\rm NL}=-0.0\pm 4.1$, $18\%$ stronger than the CMB only result, which represents the strongest bound on multi-field inflation yet obtained.

 - **Abstract**
 We present 4,110 strong gravitational lens candidates, 3,887 of which are new discoveries, selected from a sample of 5,837,154 luminous red galaxies (LRGs) observed with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Candidates are identified via the presence of background ionized oxygen [O II] nebular emission lines in the foreground LRG spectra which may originate from the lensing of higher redshift star-forming galaxies. Using the measured foreground redshift, background redshift, and integrated flux of the background [O II] doublet, we integrate over impact parameters to compute the probability that each candidate is a lens. We expect 53% of candidates to be true lenses with Einstein radii ranging from 0.1'' to 4'', which can be confirmed with high-resolution imaging. Confirmed strong lenses from this sample will form a valuable cosmological dataset, as strong gravitational lensing is the only method to directly measure dark matter halo substructure at cosmological distances. We independently recover the host of the multiply imaged gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova iPTF16geu (Goobar et al. 2017). Monitoring these lenses for future multiply lensed transients will enable a) H0 measurements via time-delay cosmography and b) substructure measurements via flux ratios.

 We utilize multi-epoch line-of-sight velocity measurements from the Milky Way Survey of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument to estimate the binary fraction for member stars in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Ursa Minor. Our dataset comprises 670 distinct member stars, with a total of more than 2,000 observations collected over approximately one year. We constrain the binary fraction for UMi to be $0.61^{+0.16}_{-0.20}$ and $0.69^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$, with the binary orbital parameter distributions based on solar neighborhood observation from Duquennoy \& Mayor (1991) and Moe \& Di Stefano (2017), respectively. Furthermore, by dividing our data into two subsamples at the median metallicity, we identify that the binary fraction for the metal-rich ([Fe/H]>-2.14) population is slightly higher than that of the metal-poor ([Fe/H]<-2.14) population. Based on the Moe \& Di Stefano model, the best-constrained binary fractions for metal-rich and metal-poor populations in UMi are $0.86^{+0.14}_{-0.24}$ and $0.48^{+0.26}_{-0.19}$, respectively. After a thorough examination, we find that this offset cannot be attributed to sample selection effects. We also divide our data into two subsamples according to their projected radius to the center of UMi, and find that the more centrally concentrated population in a denser environment has a lower binary fraction of $0.33^{+0.30}_{-0.20}$, compared with $1.00^{+0.00}_{-0.32}$ for the subsample in more outskirts.

 - **Abstract**
 We find the constraint on the population of ultra-light regular primordial black holes (RPBHs) by using isocurvature gravitational waves (GW). If ultra-light RPBHs dominated the early Universe, the initial isocurvature perturbation is converted into curvature perturbation that induce second-order GW background upon evaporation of RPBHs. The upper limit of extra relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, which could be inferred from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis or Cosmic Microwave Background observations, places a constraint on the maximum energy density of GW, which in turn can be used to constrain the RPBH population. As RPBHs have different lifetime from their singular counterparts, the constraint must be modified accordingly. While the formalism that we provide is generic, we work out explicitly the case of Simpson-Visser metric for demonstration. The RPBHs associated with this metric have lower Hawking temperature and smaller horizon size, leading to a longer lifetime than the singular Schwarzschild black holes. This implies a stronger constraint on RPBH population as they dominate the Universe for a longer period of time and generate stronger GW.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the imminent science goals of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is the detection of a continuous gravitational wave (CGW) emitted by an individual supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB). SMBHBs that cause CGWs with GW frequencies $f_\mathrm{GW} > 10 \text{nHz}$ have undergone significant orbital evolution, hence a change of $f_\mathrm{GW}$ over time. In PTA data sets with sufficiently long observational time span, this means that the Earth and pulsar terms' contributions to the CGW signal signature can eventually become resolvable. Since the pulsar term is accumulated incoherently and thus often treated as an additional source of noise, this separation can prove to be beneficial for the detection of the CGW signal in the PTA data set. We aim to investigate to what extent resolvable Earth and pulsar terms affect currently used techniques for CGW searches with PTA data sets, that treat the pulsar term as an additional source noise. We focus on the dependency of the pulsar term frequencies on the pulsar's distance. We aim to answer the question of whether adding more distant pulsars to a PTA data set can mitigate biases and improve the detection of CGWs. We show that under ideal conditions, more distant pulsars can facilitate the CGW search with PTA data sets. Bayesian parameter estimation is yielding better parameter constraints and the frequentist per-frequentist optimal statistic search becomes more stable. However, using the realistic data set simulations, it was found that other configuration parameters of a PTA, such as the anisotropic distribution of pulsars and the effective number of pulsars in a PTA, can play a crucial role to the importance of this effect.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, a class of dormant black hole binaries with luminous companions (dBH-LC) has been observed, such as $Gaia$ BH1, BH2, and BH3. Unlike previously discovered X-ray BH binaries, this type of dBH-LC has relatively long orbital periods (typically more than several tens to a few hundred days) and shows very weak X-ray emission. Therefore, studying the formation and evolution of the whole dBH-LC population is also a very interesting problem. Our aim is to study the contribution of massive stars to the dBH-LC population under different evolutionary models (isolated binary evolution (IBE) and hierarchical triple evolution), and different formation channels (such as mass transfer, common envelope evolution). Using the Massive Objects in Binary Stellar Evolution (MOBSE) code, the Triple Stellar Evolution (TSE) code, and the latest initial multiple-star distributions, we model the populations of massive stars. Finally, we calculate the orbital properties, mass distributions, and birthrates of the BH-LC populations formed under these different conditions. In the Milky Way, we calculate that the birthrate of dBH-LC formed through IBE is about 4.35$\times$$10^{-5}$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$, while the birthrate through triple evolution is about 1.47$\times$$10^{-3}$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$. This means that the birthrate from triple evolution is one to two orders of magnitude higher than that from IBE. We find that in triple evolution, the main formation channel of dBH-LC is post-merger binaries formed from inner binary mergers triggered by von Zeipel$-$Lidov$-$Kozai oscillations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a population-scale catalogue of 287,872 supermassive black hole masses with high accuracy. Using a deep encoder-decoder network trained on optical spectra with reverberation-mapping (RM) based labels of 849 quasars and applied to all SDSS quasars up to $z=4$, our method achieves a root-mean-square error of $0.058$\,dex, a relative uncertainty of $\approx 14\%$, and coefficient of determination $R^{2}\approx0.91$ with respect to RM-based masses, far surpassing traditional single-line virial estimators. Notably, the high accuracy is maintained for both low ($<10^{7.5}\,M_\odot$) and high ($>10^{9}\,M_\odot$) mass quasars, where empirical relations are unreliable.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the design and testing of a prototype multiplexing kinetic inductance detector (KID) readout electronics for the PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) space mission. PRIMA is a Probe-class astrophysics mission concept that will answer fundamental questions about the formation of planetary systems, the co-evolution of stars and supermassive black holes in galaxies, and the rise of heavy elements and dust over cosmic time. The readout electronics for PRIMA must be compatible with operation at Earth-Sun L2 and capable of multiplexing more than 1000 detectors over 2.5 GHz bandwidth while consuming around 30 W per readout chain. The electronics must also be capable of switching between the two instruments, which have different readout bands: the hyperspectral imager (PRIMAger, 2.6-4.9 GHz) and the spectrometer (FIRESS, 0.4-2.4 GHz). The PRIMA readout electronics use high-heritage SpaceCube digital electronics with a build-to-print SpaceCube Mini v3.0 board using a radiation-tolerant Kintex KU060 field programmable gate array (FPGA) and a custom high-speed digitizer board, along with RF electronics that provide filtering and power conditioning. We present the driving requirements for the system, as well as the hardware, firmware, software, and system-level design that meets those requirements.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic investigation of long-term mid-infrared (MIR) color variability in 1,718 Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) using 14-year \textit{WISE}/NEOWISE monitoring data. Through Pearson correlation analysis between photometric magnitude and color, we identify: (1) a radio-quiet NLSy1 (RQ-NLSy1) population comprising 230 bluer-when-brighter (BWB) sources, 131 redder-when-brighter (RWB) sources, and 1,323 objects showing weak or statistically insignificant color variations; and (2) a radio-loud NLSy1 (RL-NLSy1) population containing 5 BWBs, 2 RWBs, and 27 sources with weak/no color variations. Our analysis reveals that the BWB tendency strengthens significantly in galaxies with redder mean MIR colors $\rm \left<W1-W2\right>$ and lower starlight contamination. Furthermore, this color-change pattern demonstrates that the most bolometric luminous sources exhibit the most pronounced BWB behavior. While similar trends exist for black hole mass and Eddington ratio, bolometric luminosity appears to be the primary physical driver. Potential origins of these variations (e.g., host galaxy contribution, accretion disk variability, and dust reprocessing) are discussed. We conclude that temperature-dependent dust reprocessing dominates the observed BWB, RWB, and no/weak variation patterns. This interpretation may also apply to similar MIR color variations observed in other extragalactic MIR transients, such as tidal disruption events, ambiguous nuclear transients, and changing-look AGNs. In addition, we find no significant difference in long-term MIR color variations between RL-NLSy1s and RQ-NLSy1s, however, RL-NLSy1s show significantly greater dispersion in intrinsic variability amplitude compared to RQ-NLSy1s due to jet-induced complexity, where non-thermal synchrotron emission from relativistic jets obscures thermal dust signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's 10-Year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to produce a hundredfold increase in the number of transients we observe. However, there are insufficient spectroscopic resources to follow up on all of the wealth of targets that LSST will provide. As such it is necessary to be able to prioritise objects for followup observations or inclusion in sample studies based purely on their LSST photometry. We are particularly keen to identify tidal disruption events (TDEs) with LSST. TDEs are immensely useful for determining black hole parameters and probing our understanding of accretion physics. To assist in these efforts, we present the Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on the Observations of Real Nuclear transients (MALLORN) data set and the corresponding classifier challenge for identifying TDEs. MALLORN comprises 10178 simulated LSST light curves, constructed from real Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations of 64 TDEs, 727 nuclear supernovae and 1407 AGN with spectroscopic labels using Gaussian process fitting, empirically-motivated spectral energy distributions from SNCosmo and the baseline from the Rubin Survey Simulator. Our novel approach can be easily adapted to simulate transients for any photometric survey using observations from another, requiring only the limiting magnitudes and an estimate of the cadence of observations. The MALLORN Astronomical Classification Challenge, launched on Kaggle on 15/10/2025, will allow competitors to test their photometric classifiers on simulated LSST data to find TDEs and improve upon their capabilities prior to the start of LSST.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in inflationary scenarios featuring an ultra-slow-roll (USR) plateau, focusing on two coexisting production channels: PBHs originating from relic vacuum bubbles where the inflaton got trapped on the plateau, and PBHs arising from standard adiabatic density perturbations. From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $\zeta[\zeta_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $\delta N$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.

#### The spectrum of $n_s$ constraints from DESI and CMB data

 - **Abstract**
 We present the spectrum of $n_s$ constraints from current CMB data (Planck, ACT, SPT-3G) combined with DESI BAO data, and highlight the interplay of $n_s$ with the optical depth to reionization $\tau$. The spectral index $n_s$ of the primordial power spectrum provides a window into early universe, and constraints on $n_s$ play an important role in discriminating early universe models such as models of cosmic inflation. Historically constrained by cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, the constraints on $n_s$ shift upward when CMB data is combined with the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Recent work explained the origin of this and the relation to the BAO-CMB tension between CMB experiments and DESI BAO, and as a case study presented constraints on $n_s$ from the combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 data and DESI DR2 data. Here we present constraints from Planck (PR3 and PR4), ACT, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the combination of all three CMB experiments, CMB-SPA, with and without DESI DR2 BAO data, and with and without CMB lensing data. In all cases the constraint on $n_s$ is shifted upwards when DESI is included, with the largest shift exhibited by ACT. This is accompanied by a commensurate shift in the constraint on the optical depth to reionization $\tau$, which is again greatest for ACT. When CMB data are combined into CMB-SPA and combined with DESI the $n_s$ constraint disfavors at more than $2\sigma$ the inflation models preferred by Planck alone, such as Higgs, Starobinsky, and exponential $\alpha$-attractors, in favor of other models, such as polynomial $\alpha$-attractors. This work motivates the further study of the tension between CMB and DESI BAO data, and of the rich interplay between $n_s$ and $\tau$.

 - **Abstract**
 This manuscript endeavors to construct a pilgrim dark energy framework within the $f\mathbb{(Q,T)}$ gravity theory, employing a correspondence approach aligned with a non-interacting model that incorporates pressureless matter alongside a power-law scale factor. Here $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{T}$ represent the non-metricity and trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. This extended modified gravity framework accurately replicates various epochs in the cosmological history. The $f\mathbb{(Q,T)}$ gravity models are utilized to derive the equation of state parameter, phase planes and squared speed of sound. The analysis reveals that the reconstructed model exhibits an increasing or decreasing trend with the pilgrim dark energy parameter. The equation of state parameter characterizes the phantom regime, while the squared speed of sound parameter provides a stable framework for examining the ongoing cosmic evolution. The $\omega_{DE}-\omega'_{DE}$ plane trajectories reveal the freezing region, while the $r-s$ phase plane shows the Chaplygin gas model. It is important to highlight that our findings align with the most recent observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical objects like black holes are usually surrounded by matter in the form of accretion disks or jets of matter. These astrophysical scenarios are expected to introduce novel phenomenology in the scattering of particles and fields. Wormholes are viable candidates for exotic compact objects that can mimic some black hole properties. Hence, it is natural to wonder what would happen if the central astrophysical object were a wormhole, instead of a black hole. We investigate the astrophysical environment effect on the absorption of a massless scalar field by a dirty wormhole surrounded by a thick shell of matter. We study null geodesics around these dirty wormholes and analyze under which conditions new pairs of light rings can appear. The presence of new stable light rings allows new quasibound states in the spacetime, apart from the ones trapped near the throat. Thus, the astrophysical environment can introduce deviations in the absorption bands. Remarkably, although heavy and dense distributions of matter are considered surrounding the wormhole, the position of most of the spectral lines in the absorption bands is preserved, indicating that the astrophysical environment cannot hide some fingerprints of the central object.

 We investigate some cosmological implications at background level of the Bumblebee model. The phase-space, the critical points and their stability are analyzed in detail applying well-established dynamical system techniques. What is more, upon comparison to available supernovae data, the best fit numerical value of the unique free parameter of the model is determined. We show graphically all the cosmological quantities of interest versus red-shift, such as the deceleration parameter, dark energy equation of state parameter, etc. The statefinders and the age of the Universe are also computed. Finally, a comparison to the $\Lambda$-CDM model is made as well.

#### Hairy black holes via gravitational decoupling: light rings, absorption and spectral lines

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the absorption of massless scalar waves by three distinct hairy black hole solutions obtained through the gravitational decoupling method, considering the weak, the strong or the dominant energy conditions. Remarkably, in certain configurations of hairy black holes associated with the fulfillment of the weak energy condition, quasibound states may appear, resulting in Breit-Wigner-like resonances in their absorption profile. These quasibound states (and consequently the spectral lines in the absorption spectrum) can be related to stable light rings in the spacetime, a structure often associated with horizonless exotic compact objects, such as wormholes. We investigate how the gravitational decoupling method introduces novel light ring structures in hairy black holes and influences the absorption spectra through its deformation parameters. Our numerical results show excellent agreement with well-known approximations.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper studies the thermodynamics and Ruppeiner geometry of D-dimensional RN black holes. We analyze the thermodynamic curvature scalar $R$ in various thermodynamic ensembles. It is found that in an ensemble of fixed charge (canonical ensemble), the Ruppeiner curvature is curved and diverges at a critical point, indicating the existence of a phase transition for $D > 4$. In contrast, when all extensive variables are allowed to fluctuate (for example, in a grand-canonical ensemble or with pressure fixed), the Ruppeiner geometry can appear flat. We also demonstrate that the thermodynamic geometric metric has a one-to-one correspondence with the periodicity of the Euclidean path integral method. In particular, the inverse temperature (the Euclidean time period) serves as a bridge connecting the thermodynamic geometry and the Euclidean action approach.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences has provided significant insights into our Universe, and the discovery of new and unique gravitational wave candidates from independent searches remains an ongoing field of research. In this work, we built a hybrid search pipeline that combines matched filtering and deep learning to identify stellar-mass binary black hole candidates from detector strain data. We first present results from a targeted injection study to benchmark the sensitivity of our method and compare it with existing search pipelines. We demonstrate that our hybrid approach has comparable sensitivity for injections with a source-frame chirp mass greater than 25$\,$M$_{\odot}$, and below this threshold our sensitivity drops off for signals with a network SNR less than 15. We also observe that our search method can identify a significant population of unique candidates. Furthermore, we conduct an offline search for gravitational wave candidates in the third observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK), yielding 31 candidates previously reported by the LVK with a probability of astrophysical origin $p_{\rm astro}\geq0.5$. We identify two other candidates: one previously reported only in a search conducted by the Institute for Advanced Study, and one previously unreported promising new candidate with a $p_{\rm astro}$ of 0.63. This unique candidate has a high chirp mass and a high probability that the primary black hole is an intermediate-mass black hole.

#### From Source Properties to Strong-Field Tests: a multipronged analysis of GW250114 with an effective one-body model for generic orbits

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of GW250114, the loudest gravitational-wave signal observed to date, using a waveform model capable of describing binary black holes in generic (eccentric and precessing) orbits. Our analysis builds on LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK)'s results, finding that the source is consistent at a probability of $\geq 96\%$ with the merger of two first-generation, nearly equal-mass, low-spin black holes, forming a remnant within the pair-instability mass gap. The signal's high signal-to-noise ratio ($\gtrsim 75$) enables the detection of the subdominant $(4,\pm4)$ multipoles, whose presence we confirm with higher evidence than previously reported by the LVK. Restricting the analysis even to post-peak data yields $\log_{10}B\gtrsim 1$ in favor of models including the $(4,\pm4)$ mode, demonstrating that this contribution remains detectable well into the post-merger phase. We further perform three independent tests of general relativity, complementary to those performed by the LVK: a modified residual analysis confirms that our semi-analytical model fully describes the signal without detectable discrepancies; a subdominant mode test finds that the amplitude of the $(4,\pm4)$ multipoles agrees with general-relativistic expectations; and a parameterised analysis of the plunge-merger-ringdown regime recovers the GR expectation within the 50\% credible region for the remnant mass and spin, and within the 90\% interval for the $(2,\pm2)$ peak amplitude. Collectively, these results reinforce GW250114 as a landmark event for a precision test of gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 The investigation of gravity in higher-dimensional spacetime has transitioned from a mathematical curiosity to a fundamental framework in theoretical physics, catalyzed by the dimensional requirements of String theory and M-theory. In this paper, we explicitly construct a spherically symmetric charged black hole solution in $D \ge 5$ dimensions within a gravity theory featuring an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. For a given mass and electric charge, the model admits a unique static spherically symmetric solution. We demonstrate that, with an appropriate choice of coupling coefficients $\alpha_n$, the central singularity is progressively mitigated as the correction order increases, ultimately resolving into a globally regular spacetime in the limit of infinite-order corrections. Furthermore, the criteria for the existence of extremal black holes are determined.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic post-Newtonian treatment of binary charged black holes immersed in external magnetic fields within the framework of Einstein-Maxwell theory. By incorporating a uniform external magnetic field into the two-body Lagrangian expanded to first post-Newtonian order, we derive the complete equations of motion that capture both gravitational and electromagnetic interactions. The magnetic Lorentz force fundamentally alters the orbital dynamics, breaking the conservation of linear and angular momentum and inducing transitions from planar to three-dimensional trajectories. Through numerical integration of these equations, we compute the resulting gravitational waveforms and quantify the magnetic field imprints using matched filtering techniques. Our results demonstrate that strong background magnetic fields can substantially modify the orbital evolution and leave distinctive signatures in the gravitational wave signals. These findings provide a promising avenue for detecting charged black holes and probing magnetic field environments through gravitational wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the imprints of chaos in gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals configuration, where a stellar massive object, confined in a harmonic potential, orbits a supermassive Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter halo. In our first paper [1], we demonstrated the system's transition from non-chaotic to chaotic dynamics by analyzing Poincaré sections, orbital evolution, and Lyapunov exponents across different energies and dark matter halo parameters. In this work, we compute the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial object along different chaotic and non-chaotic orbits by implementing the numerical kludge scheme. We further perform a spectral analysis of the gravitational waveforms from such orbits. In particular, we show that when the system is in a chaotic state, the gravitational wave signals are characterized by broader frequency spectra with finite widths, enhanced amplitude and energy emission rate, distinctly differentiating them from the signals generated during the system's non-chaotic state. Through recurrence analysis we also show that the time series of gravitational waveforms strain carry unique information on the motion of chaotic dynamics, which can be used to distinctly differentiate from non-chaotic to chaotic motion of the source. Furthermore, we discuss the potential detectability of these orbits for upcoming observatories like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, emphasizing the significant potential for detecting chaotic imprints in gravitational waves to substantially enhance our understanding of chaotic dynamics in black hole physics and the dark matter environments of galactic nuclei.

 - **Abstract**
 Relativistic black hole collisions are one of the most dramatic astrophysical events that can be imagined. They could provide the ideal condition for searching for possible new physics beyond general relativity. However, such events are presumably rare and difficult to occur under normal conditions. Black holes in a triple system can be accelerated to the relativistic limit and may harbor the chance for a relativistic collision. In this paper, we study the relativistic black hole collisions in a massive black hole background and the capabilities of several current and future gravitational wave detectors in detecting such signals.

#### Multipole decomposition of the gravitational field of a point mass at the black hole horizon

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04976

 - **Abstract**
 The portion of the gravitational energy absorbed by the black hole due to the radial infall of a point mass is known to diverge at leading order in perturbation theory. This divergence is an artifact of the point-particle model, where the contribution of each multipole to the total absorbed energy is observed to be roughly constant. We show explicitly that this divergent energy arises from the infinite energy present in the singular static field arbitrarily close to the point mass, which also flows into the black hole when the particle trajectory crosses the horizon. We perform a multipole decomposition of the linearized gravitational field generated by the point mass near its world line at the black hole horizon. By applying the standard field-theoretical approach to the particle field, we compute the corresponding partial energy and find that it matches the constant multipole contribution.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04977

 - **Abstract**
 We show that stationary black holes and the evolving universe belong to fundamentally different thermodynamic regimes: black holes obey ordinary Bekenstein Hawking thermodynamics, whereas cosmology necessarily follows memory-bearing teleodynamics. We show that teleodynamics is not valid for black holes, but is unavoidable in an expanding cosmology. This provides a dynamical, semi-classical realization of the thermodynamic split conjecture and identifies memory accumulation as the natural source of deviations from the area law in cosmology. Our results suggest that quantum gravity should not seek to extrapolate black hole thermodynamics to the universe, but instead must incorporate horizon memory as a fundamental microscopic ingredient and consider cosmological constructions consistent with that.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore how perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole can redistribute energy among scalar modes and seed turbulent like cascades. We make use of the van der Pol-Krylov-Bogoliubov averaging method and derive coupled mode equations that describe near-resonant interactions between neighbouring multipoles. We compare two routes to instability, namely the difference-frequency mixing between adjacent modes and the diagonal (Mathieu) self-modulation channel. We show that, at high multipole number (eikonal limit), the difference-frequency route dominates and drives a one-way cascade from higher to lower frequencies. We chart the corresponding instability regions ("tongues") and quantify their detuning dependence. The framework provides a simple, quantitative mechanism for energy transfer in black hole ringdowns and clarifies when and how turbulent signatures can arise within linear probes on a weakly perturbed background.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an alternative dimensional reduction that yields an effective theory of dilatons in a two-dimensional de Sitter background. Specifically, by performing an S-wave reduction of higher-dimensional Einstein gravity, we obtain free massless dilatons in the static patch, and a dynamically evolving dilatons in the past Milne wedge. We then propose a static patch worldsheet formulation in terms of CFTs with SL(2,$\mathbb{R}$) deformed Hamiltonians on the cylinder. A key feature of this construction is that a stretched horizon in the static patch, equipped with an emergent UV boundary condition, acts as a gravitating observer. Using the similar reduction, we have also obtained a Schwarzian action coupled to free massless dilatons in the near horizon near extremal limit of four dimensional charged AdS black holes. The worldsheet description for the same has been proposed and discussed in \cite{Das:2025cuq}. We also comment on how different notions of worldsheet time may themselves be \textit{emergent}.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct entanglement surfaces for rotating cylindrical black holes in a double holographic setup, extending previous results to the case of stationary backgrounds. We analyze both the 5d braneworld construction as well as the embedding in 10d type IIB string theory. We couple the rotating cylindrical black hole to a non-gravitating bath, and study island and Hartman-Maldacena surfaces. Properties of island surfaces are characterized by three regimes, bounded by two critical parameters. In addition to the critical value known for the static case, we find that a new one emerges, related to the extremal limit of the rotating black hole. This behaviour is present both for the bottom-up as well as the top-down models, for which we find qualitative agreement.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the effect of modular flow on correlation functions of fermions in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model coupled weakly to a bath, which we take to be another SYK model. The system and bath, together are prepared in the thermofield double (TFD) state, and we focus on the effect of modular flow generated by the reduced density matrix for the SYK system, obtained by tracing out the bath. We show, in the late time limit, that modular flowed correlators of two Majorana fermions, single-sided and two-sided, exhibit non-trivial singularities. Beyond a critical value of the modular parameter, the ``modular scrambling time", the singularity structure shows correlations being transferred from one boundary to the other. The calculations are performed by employing the replica trick in Euclidean time and appropriately analytically continuing to real time. Exploiting the connection between modular flow generators and SL$(2,{\mathbb R})$ boosts we use the microscopic picture to reconstruct the dual bulk modular flow in two-sided AdS$_2$ black hole spacetime. Fixed points of the flow allow to identify quantum extremal surfaces (QES) demarcating the entanglement wedge of the boundary system and the island. We show that bulk modular flow can move fermion insertions near the right boundary past the horizon leading to lightcone singularities in appropriately smeared boundary correlators, probing physics beyond the horizon.

 - **Abstract**
 It is well known that there is a region of parameter space where all purely electric, static, dilatonic black holes are unstable within the STU models of maximal supergravity. We show that, for planar black holes, it is possible to complete the thermal phase space with AdS solitons, in such a way that the instability of the black holes signals the onset of confinement in the dual field theory. The analysis is done for the $D=4$ STU model of maximal gauged supergravity which naturally uplift to M-theory on the $S^7$.
