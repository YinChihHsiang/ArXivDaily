#### Effective Field Theory Constraints on Primordial Black Holes from the High-Redshift Lyman-$α$ Forest

 - **Abstract**
 We present updated constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) dark matter from the high-redshift Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data from MIKE/HIRES experiments. Our analysis leverages an effective field theory (EFT) description of the 1D flux power spectrum, allowing us to analytically predict the Lyman-$\alpha$ fluctuations on quasi-linear scales from first principles. Our EFT-based likelihood enables robust inference across redshifts $z = 4.2-5.4$ and down to scales of 100 kpc, within previously unexplored regions of parameter space for this dataset. We derive new bounds on the PBH fraction with respect to the total dark matter $f_{\text{PBH}}$, excluding populations with $f_{\text{PBH}} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ for masses $M_{\text{PBH}} \sim 10^{4}-10^{16} M_{\odot}$. This offers the leading constraint for PBHs heavier than $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ and highlights the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest as a uniquely sensitive probe of new physics models that modify the structure formation history of our universe.

#### Resolution-Corrected White Dwarf Gravitational Redshifts Validate SDSS-V Wavelength Calibration and Enable Accurate Mass-Radius Tests

 - **Abstract**
 Leveraging the large sample size of low-resolution spectroscopic surveys to constrain white dwarf stellar structure requires an accurate understanding of the shapes of hydrogen absorption lines, which are pressure broadened by the Stark effect. Using data from both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Type Ia Supernova Progenitor Survey, we show that substantial biases (5-15 km/s) exist in radial velocity measurements made from observations at low spectral resolution relative to similar measurements from high-resolution spectra. Our results indicate that the physics of line formation in high-density plasmas, especially in the wings of the lines, are not fully accounted for in state-of-the-art white dwarf model atmospheres. We provide corrections to account for these resolution-induced redshifts in a way that is independent of an assumed mass-radius relation, and we demonstrate that statistical measurements of gravitational redshift with these corrections yield improved agreement with theoretical mass-radius relations. Our results provide a set of best practices for white dwarf radial velocity measurements from low-resolution spectroscopy, including those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the 4-meter Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope, and the Wide-Field Multiplexed Spectroscopic Facility.

#### Leading & Trailing Spiral Arms in a Nearly Broken Protoplanetary Disc
 - **Authors:** Sahl Rowther, Rebecca Nealon, Richard Alexander, Farzana Meru
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04914

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04914

 - **Abstract**
 We perform three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to investigate the formation of spiral arms in misaligned circumbinary discs. In a nearly broken disc the misaligned inner and outer discs interact at two nodes, launching leading spiral arms that do not rotate with the disc. These spirals vanish when the disc is fully broken or aligned. Our results show that the formation of leading spirals is driven by the relative misalignment of the inner and outer disc, and does not depend on the disc physics. With live radiative transfer, the shadows cast by the misaligned inner disc are also able to launch trailing spiral arms that only appear at high misalignments when the discs are disconnected. When the disc is strongly misaligned, leading and trailing spiral arms can both appear and interact with each other. At lower misalignments, the impact of shadows is negligible and leading spiral arms are seen instead. The presence of both leading and trailing spiral arms implies that the rotation of the disc cannot be assumed based on the orientation of the spiral arms alone. Unlike spirals formed by gravitational instability, the spirals in this work can also form in low-mass, gravitationally stable discs.

#### Cosmic string gravitational wave backgrounds at LISA: I. Signal survey, template reconstruction, and model comparison
 - **Authors:** Androniki Dimitriou, Daniel G. Figueroa, Peera Simakachorn, Bryan Zaldivar

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05395

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05395

 - **Abstract**
 We present a catalog of gravitational wave background (GWB) signal templates from cosmic-string networks, based on relevant models proposed in the literature. We classify templates as conventional, based on standard cosmology and Nambu-Goto results (VOS and BOS), and beyond conventional, based on modifications of a) the loop number density (LRS, super, metastable, current-carrying strings), b) the expansion history (non-standard cosmologies, extra degrees of freedom, either thermal or secluded), or c) the loop properties (birth length, power emission). Using the SBI package $\texttt{GWBackFinder}$, we quantify the reconstruction precision of each signal by LISA, scanning over their parameter space, and performing model comparisons. For conventional signals, LISA reconstructs the tension $G\mu$ with an error $\lesssim 10\%$ for $G\mu \gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{-15}$, which decreases down to $2-3\%$ for $G\mu \gtrsim 10^{-12}$. BOS and VOS modelings become distinguishable confidently for $G\mu \gtrsim 5\cdot 10^{-13}$. For beyond-conventional signals, we identify SNR and error-threshold intervals for each parameter, and determine (for few examples) the regions where they can be distinguished from conventional signals. Analogous quality reconstruction studies of cosmic-string GWBs, superimposed over leading astrophysical foregrounds in the LISA window, will be presented in a series of upcoming papers.

#### Constraints on DBI dark energy with chameleon mechanism

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the Dirac Born Infeld chameleon scalar field model in light of the latest cosmological observations, analyzing the model both with the incorporation of the chameleon mechanism and without it. Results from current cosmological observations, such as Pantheon Plus, DES Y5, DESI DR2, and the compressed Planck likelihood, are used to constrain the model. We consider the AdS throat in the form of $f(\phi) = \lambda / \phi^4$ and a potential $V(\phi) = m_0^2 \phi^2 + m_1^2 \phi^4$ .One interesting finding from our analysis is that, without the chameleon mechanism, the mean value of $m_1 \simeq 0$ indicates the self-interaction of the DBI field could potentially be negligible. Constraints on the potential parameters do not appear when considering the chameleon mechanism, but the warp parameter and chameleon coupling parameter are forced to satisfy $\eta \geq 0$ and $\beta \leq 0$. Different choices of $\beta$ render the same background cosmological parameters. The equation of state $w_{\rm DE}$ resides more in the quintessence region in the past. There is no phantom crossing in this model under our assumption of the warp throat and potential. By computing the $\Delta \text{AIC}$ relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model, we study statistical model comparison. The model as a candidate of dynamical dark energy is observationally viable at the cosmological background level.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper demonstrates how the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1) and future baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) analyses can optimally combine overlapping tracers (galaxies of distinct types) in the same redshift range. We make a unified catalog of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) in the redshift range 0.8 < z < 1.1 and investigate the impact on the BAO constraints. DESI DR1 contains ~30% of the final DESI LRG sample and less than 25% of the final ELG sample, and the combination of LRGs and ELGs increases the number density and reduces the shot noise. We developed a pipeline to merge the overlapping tracers using galaxy bias as an approximately optimal weight and tested the pipeline on a suite of Abacus simulations, calibrated on the final version of the DESI Early Data Release. When applying our pipeline to the DESI DR1 catalog, we find an improvement in the BAO constraints of 11% for $\alpha_\mathrm{iso}$ and ~7.0% for $\alpha_\mathrm{AP}$ consistent with our findings in mock catalogs. Our analysis was integrated into the DESI DR1 BAO analysis to produce the LRG+ELG result in the 0.8 < z < 1.1 redshift bin, which provided the most precise BAO measurement from DESI DR1 with a 0.86% constraint on the BAO distance scale and a $9.1\sigma$ detection of the isotropic BAO feature.

 - **Abstract**
 This work explores the gravitational wave echoes (GWEs) from the compact stellar configurations in the backdrop of $f(R,L_{m},T)$ gravity within static and spherically symmetric framework. Our study has utilized the MIT Bag model and color-favour-locked (CFL) phase equations of state (EoS) for matter description. Mass-radius profiles were determined by solving the hydrostatic equilibrium equations. Model parameter variations were used to assess the configuration stability here. TOV solutions helped to evaluate compactness. Our results indicate that MIT bag model and CFL EoS in $f(R,L_{m},T)$ modified gravitational theory are capable of producing GWEs. The calculated wave frequencies lie within the range of $ 7.5-11 $ kHz range. We have also demonstrated that how different gravitational theory parametrization within $f(R,L_{m},T)$ theory affect our star structure and echo frequency characteristics. Surface redshift and adiabatic index analysis confirm the stability of our stellar model here.

#### Quintessence-Chameleon transitions in anisotropic Kiselev model of neutron stars

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a chameleon scalar field dynamically interacting with a Kiselev-type metric, where the static anisotropic fluid part of the metric is replaced by a density-dependent scalar field non-minimally coupled to curvature. This construction enables a transition from screened behavior in high-density regions-where the scalar acquires an effective mass m_\phi\propto\rho^1/2-to unscreened quintessence dynamics at large scales, characterized by a critical screening radius r_\rm crit\propto m_\phi^-1. By solving the modified TOV equations under spherical symmetry, we show that radial scalar gradients \partial_r\phi induce pressure anisotropies \Delta p\propto r^-1 in neutron star envelopes, while deviations from general relativity are suppressed deep in the core r<r_\rm crit\sim 0.03\,\mathrm{km} without destabilizing it. We further demonstrate that increasing the scalar coupling \beta enhances scalar energy density, which counteracts anisotropic pressure support and slightly reduces the maximum mass. The resulting (stable) configurations yield maximum mass M_max\approx 1.75\pm0.280\,M_\odot and radii R\approx11.35\pm1.11\,\mathrm{km}, consistent with conservative upper and lower bounds from multimessenger observations. Scalar contributions induce a modest suppression in the dimensionless tidal deformability \Lambda_\rm ST\Lambda_\rm GR\sim0.137 at 1.4\,M_\odot i.e, 86% suppression compared to typical GR star, falling well within the LIGO/Virgo range 70\lesssim\Lambda_1.4\lesssim 580. These results demonstrate that environmentally screened scalar fields can dynamically generate anisotropies and modify neutron star structure without violating current astrophysical bounds. In particular, percent-level deviations in compactness and tidal response provide falsifiable signatures of short-range scalar forces, offering a novel target for next-generation GW and multimessenger surveys.

#### Four-scalar model and spherically symmetric solution in $f({\cal T})$ theory

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04758

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the construction of spherically symmetric solutions within the framework of modified teleparallel gravity, focusing in particular on $f({\cal T})$ theory, where ${\cal T}$ represents the torsion scalar. Conventional mimetic gravity and its extension with two scalar fields are unable to reproduce general spherically symmetric geometries in $f({\cal T})$ gravity, since consistency requires either a constant torsion scalar or a linear form of $f({\cal T})$, which corresponds to the teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR). To overcome this restriction, we introduce a four-scalar field formulation that generalizes the two-scalar model and enables the realization of arbitrary spherically symmetric spacetimes. We further demonstrate that the model avoids ghost degrees of freedom by imposing appropriate constraints through Lagrange multipliers. As an application of the formalism, we examine a specific spherically symmetric metric and determine the corresponding four scalar fields, analyzing their properties. In the presence of a quadratic extension of the action, ${\cal T} + \tfrac{\alpha}{2}{\cal T}^2$, our approach successfully reconstructs physically viable solutions free from ghost instabilities. These findings highlight the potential of scalar-field-based constructions for generating consistent spacetime geometries in modified gravity theories, thereby extending beyond the standard formulations.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04783

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the accretion of a collisionless, relativistic kinetic gas by a rotating Kerr black hole, assuming that at infinity the state of the gas is described by a distribution function depending only on the energy of the particles. Neglecting the self-gravity of the gas, we show that relevant physical observables, including the particle current density and the accretion rates associated with the mass, the energy, and the angular momentum, can be expressed in the form of closed integrals that can be evaluated numerically or approximated analytically in the slow-rotation limit. The accretion rates are computed in this manner for both monoenergetic particles and the Maxwell-Jüttner distribution and compared with the corresponding results in the non-rotating case. Whereas it is shown that the angular momentum accretion rate vanishes exactly, it is found that the rotation of the black hole has a small but non-vanishing effect on the mass and the energy accretion rates, which is remarkably well described by an analytic calculation in the slow-rotation approximation to quadratic order in the rotation parameter. The effects of rotation on the morphology of the accretion flow are also analyzed.

#### Post-Newtonian expansion of scale-dependent gravity

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.04810

 - **Abstract**
 Scale-dependent gravity is an extension of general relativity in which the Newton and cosmological constants may vary slightly with the energy scale due to remnant low-energy quantum effects. A fundamental feature of this approach is the scale-setting procedure. In a previous work by one of the authors, a covariant expression for the scale, consistent with conservation laws, was established. Here, we apply the full Will-Nordtvedt version of the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism to this framework, assuming that the constants can be expressed as a power series in the scale. We find that a new potential arises at the first post-Newtonian order, which is absent from the standard PPN formalism. This potential modifies the definitions of pressure and internal energy but does not affect center-of-mass orbits and is, therefore, not constrained by Solar System tests.

#### Black holes and wormholes in sourceless three-dimensional conformal Killing gravity

#### Non-stationary wormholes with the presence of scalar fields and modified gravity

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05536

 - **Abstract**
 Some novel regular spacetimes are considered that show a non-stationary wormhole structure. A Simpson-Visser-like procedure is applied to reconstruct these regular spacetimes, free of time-like and space-like singularities. Such a procedure is also applied to describe a regular cosmological expansion, where the universe reaches a minimum scale and then rebounds. This type of regular spacetime is achieved by considering some scalar fields as sources, with the appropriate kinetic term and scalar potential. We show that all these sources turn out to be ghosts due to the wrong sign of the kinetic term. These ghosts can, however, be eliminated by constraints. Nevertheless, the same procedure is also explored in the framework of modified gravities, particularly within the so-called f(R) gravity, where a new wormhole spacetime is also obtained that does not require a ghost scalar field.

#### Explorations of Universality in the Entropy and Hawking Radiation of Non-Extremal Kerr AdS$_4$ Black Holes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05322

 - **Abstract**
 We comprehensively discuss various microscopic approaches to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for rotating, electrically charged, asymptotically AdS$_4$ non-extremal black holes in gauged supergravity. We apply the covariant phase space formalism to the near-horizon region to obtain a Cardy-formula-based microscopic explanation for the entropy, consistent with the Kerr/CFT correspondence. From the dual boundary CFT point of view, we estimate the free partition function in the matrix model approximation in the high-temperature regime and find qualitative agreement with the supergravity answer. All these different approaches match in the appropriate limits and support the universality of AdS black hole entropy even at high temperatures, far away from extremality. Prompted by the consistency of the results of statistical explanations for the AdS$_4$ black hole entropy, we discuss aspects of the rate of Hawking radiation at high temperatures from the CFT$_2$ perspective and found it to be universally proportional to the horizon area.

#### Violating Weak Cosmic Censorship in AdS$_3$ via Gedanken Experiment

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.05384

 - **Abstract**
 The weak cosmic censorship conjecture (wCCC) might not be as robust as one would expect. We present a potential counterexample to the wCCC in a rotating three-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS$_3$) spacetime. We extend the parameter range of the quantum corrected BTZ (qBTZ) black hole. We examine the infall of test particles with large orbital angular momentum into an extremal black hole. Our findings indicate that, under certain conditions -- such as neglecting the self-force effects -- the event horizon can be destroyed, leading to a violation of the wCCC. The results suggest that this solution should either be excluded from the applicability of the wCCC or should be examined with self-force effects incorporated.
