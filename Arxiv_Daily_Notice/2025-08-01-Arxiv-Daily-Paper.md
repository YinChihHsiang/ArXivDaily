 - **Abstract**
 Simulation-based inference (SBI) allows fast Bayesian inference for simulators encoding implicit likelihoods. However, some explicit likelihoods cannot be easily reformulated as simulators, hindering their integration into combined analyses within SBI frameworks. One key example in cosmology is given by the Planck CMB likelihoods. We present a simple method to construct an effective simulator for any explicit likelihood using samples from a previously converged Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) run. This effective simulator can subsequently be combined with any forward simulator. To illustrate this method, we combine the full Planck CMB likelihoods with a 3x2pt simulator (cosmic shear, galaxy clustering and their cross-correlation) for a Stage IV survey like Euclid, and test evolving dark energy parameterized by the $w_0w_a$ equation-of-state. Assuming the $w_0w_a$CDM cosmology hinted by DESI BAO DR2 + Planck 2018 + PantheonPlus SNIa datasets, we find that future 3x2pt data alone could detect evolving dark energy at $5\sigma$, while its combination with current CMB, BAO and SNIa datasets could raise the detection to almost $7\sigma$. Moreover, thanks to simulation reuse enabled by SBI, we show that our joint analysis is in excellent agreement with MCMC while requiring zero Boltzmann solver calls. This result opens up the possibility of performing massive global scans combining explicit and implicit likelihoods in a highly efficient way.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations by JWST reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of rapidly growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe, underscoring the need for improved models for their origin and growth. Employing new full radiative transfer hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, we investigate the local and intergalactic feedback of SMBH progenitors for the Population III.1 scenario, i.e., efficient formation of supermassive stars from pristine, undisturbed dark matter minihalos. Our cosmological simulations capture the R-type expansion phase of these Pop III.1 stars, with their H-ionizing photon luminosities of $\sim10^{53}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ generating HII regions that extend deep into the intergalactic medium, reaching comoving radii of $r_{\rm HII}\sim 1\,{\rm cMpc}$. We vary both the Pop III.1 ionization flux and cosmological formation environments, finding the former regulates their final $r_{\rm HII}$, whereas the latter is more important in setting their formation redshift. We use the results from our radiation-hydrodynamics simulations to estimate the cosmic number density of SMBHs, $n_{\rm SMBH}$, expected from Pop III.1 progenitors. We find $n_{\rm SMBH}\sim10^{-1}\,{\rm cMpc}^{-3}$, consistent with the results inferred from recent observations of the local and high redshift universe. Overall, this establishes Pop III.1 progenitors as viable candidates for the formation of the first SMBHs, and emphasises the importance of exploring heavy mass seed scenarios.

#### XL-Calibur Polarimetry of Cyg X-1 Further Constrains the Origin of its Hard-state X-ray Emission

 - **Abstract**
 The balloon-borne hard X-ray polarimetry mission XL-Calibur observed the Black Hole X-ray Binary (BHXRB) Cygnus X-1 (Cyg X-1) during its nearly six-day Long Duration Balloon (LDB) flight from Sweden to Canada in July 2024. The XL-Calibur observations allowed us to derive the most precise constraints to date of the Polarization Degree (PD) and Polarization Angle (PA) of the hard X-ray emission from a BHXRB. XL-Calibur observed Cyg X-1 in the hard state and measured a $\sim$19-64 keV PD of ($5.0^{+2.7}_{-3.0}$)% at a PA of $-28^{\circ}\pm 17^{\circ}$, with an 8.7% chance probability of detecting larger PDs than the one observed, given an unpolarized signal. The XL-Calibur results are thus comparable to the 2-8 keV PD and PA found by IXPE, with a similar agreement between the hard X-ray PA and the radio jet direction. We also discuss the implications of our polarization measurements in the context of models describing the origin of the broadband X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emission, to which XL-Calibur provides independent constraints on any proposed emission modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) involving supermassive black holes (SMBHs) often exhibit radio emission, yet its physical origin remains uncertain, especially in non-jetted cases. In this Letter, we formulate a general dynamical framework for a radio-emitting shell driven by disk winds and expanding through a power-law ambient medium under the influence of SMBH gravity. We derive and classify power-law-in-time solutions to the governing equations in the adiabatic regime. In particular, a universal $t^{2/3}$ scaling emerges naturally when gravitational energy dominates or is comparable to thermal energy, irrespective of the ambient density profile, whereas the classical Sedov-Taylor solution is recovered when gravity is negligible. Our analysis reveals that, in regimes where SMBH gravity governs the shell expansion, the SMBH mass can be inferred from radio observations of the shell. This approach is independent of and complementary to conventional mass estimators, with direct implications for interpreting radio-emitting TDEs and probing SMBH demographics. Our formalism further predicts that 10-100 GHz monitoring with existing and planned facilities can yield SMBH masses within months of disruption, providing a time-domain analogue to reverberation mapping.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) distort galaxy shapes through the tidal effect, offering a novel avenue to probe the nature of gravity. In this paper, we investigate how extra GW polarizations beyond those predicted by general relativity imprint observable signatures on galaxy shapes. Since galaxy shapes are measured as two-dimensional images projected onto the celestial sphere, we present three-dimensional statistical quantities of the projected tidal tensor sourced by the tensor perturbation. We show that the presence of extra polarization modes modifies both the amplitude and angular dependence of the correlation functions. Furthermore, we identify a distinct observational channel for probing parity violation in helicity-two and helicity-one modes. In particular, we show that if they propagate at different speeds, galaxy surveys can disentangle the source of parity violation. Our findings establish a theoretical framework for using upcoming large-scale galaxy surveys to test modified gravity theories through the polarization content of GWs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the most up-to-date constraints on axion early dark energy (AEDE) from cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements. In particular, we assess the impact of data from ground-based CMB experiments, the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) -- both with and without $Planck$ -- on constraints on AEDE. We also highlight the impact that BAO information from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has on these constraints. From CMB data alone, we do not find statistically significant evidence for the presence of AEDE, and we find only moderate reduction in the Hubble tension. From the latest SPT data alone, we find the maximal fractional contribution of AEDE to the cosmic energy budget is $f_{\rm EDE}\,<\,0.12$ at $95\,$% confidence level (CL), and the Hubble tension between the SPT and SH0ES results is reduced to the $2.3\,\sigma$ level. When combining the latest SPT, ACT, and $Planck$ datasets, we find $f_{\rm EDE}\,<\,0.091$ at $95\,$% CL and the Hubble tension at the $3.3\, \sigma$ level. In contrast, adding DESI data to the CMB datasets results in mild preference for AEDE and, in some cases, non-negligible reduction in the Hubble tension. From SPT+DESI, we find $f_{\rm EDE}\,=\,0.081^{+0.037}_{-0.052}$ at $68\,$% CL, and the Hubble tension reduces to $1.5\,\sigma$. From the combination of DESI with all three CMB experiments, we get $f_{\rm EDE}\,=\, 0.071^{+0.035}_{-0.038}$ at $68\,$% CL and a weak preference for AEDE over $\Lambda$CDM. This data combination, in turn, reduces the Hubble tension to $2.3\, \sigma$. We highlight that this shift in parameters when adding the DESI dataset is a manifestation of the discrepancy currently present between DESI and CMB experiments in the concordance model $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 The X-ray polarimetric observing window re-opening is shedding new light on our current understanding of compact accreting sources. This is true, in particular, for stellar-mass black hole sources observed in the thermally-dominated state, for which the polarization signal is expected to depend on the accretion disk inclination and the black hole spin. Two main effects determine the polarization properties of the accretion disk emission: the absorption and scattering processes occurring before the radiation leaves the disk atmosphere, and the relativistic effects influencing its propagation towards the observer at infinity. In this work, we investigate these effects together considering only the contribution of direct radiation. We analyze how the ionization state of the disk atmosphere, approximated with a constant-density surface layer assumed to be either in collisional ionization equilibrium or photoionization equilibrium, can influence the spectro-polarimetric properties of the radiation at the emitting disk surface. Subsequently we study how these are modified by the propagation in a strong gravitational field.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulated galaxy catalogues have become an essential tool for preparing and exploiting observations from galaxy surveys. They constitute a key ingredient in modelling the systematic uncertainties present in the analysis. However, in order to reach the large volume and high precision required for galaxy surveys, we generally populate dark matter haloes with galaxies following certain theoretical recipes. Such recipes contain free parameters that are calibrated comparing the simulations against observations, but the creation of galaxy mocks is a stochastic process with a large number of free parameters to calibrate. We present a new pipeline, based on the differential evolution algorithm, that can calibrate galaxy mocks in a fully automated way for realistic scenarios with a large parameter space. We apply the pipeline to galaxy mocks built on a combination of halo occupation distribution and sub-halo abundance matching techniques. We show that our pipeline can properly calibrate the galaxy mocks against observations for both $\Lambda$CDM and modified gravity halo catalogues. This type of calibration pipeline provides a new tool for automating the calibration of future massive galaxy mocks.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino-cooled accretion disks can form in the aftermath of neutron-star mergers as well as during the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars (collapsars) and the accretion-induced collapse of rapidly rotating white dwarfs. Due to Pauli blocking as electrons become degenerate at sufficiently high accretion rates $\dot{M}$, the resulting 'self-neutronization' of the dissociated accreting plasma makes these astrophysical systems promising sources of rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis (the r-process). We present a one-dimensional general-relativistic, viscous-hydrodynamic model of neutrino-cooled accretion disks around black holes. With collapsars, super-collapsars and very massive star collapse in mind, we chart the composition of the accretion flow and systematically explore different radiatively efficient and inefficient accretion regimes with increasing $\dot M$, across a vast parameter space of $\dot{M}\sim 10^{-6}-10^6 M_\odot \,\text{s}^{-1}$, black hole masses of $M_\bullet\sim 1 - 10^4 M_\odot$ and dimensionless spins of $\chi_\bullet \in [0,1)$, as well as $\alpha$-viscosity values of $\alpha\sim 10^{-3}-1$. We show that these accretion regimes are separated by characteristic thresholds $\dot{M}_{\rm char}$ that follow power laws $\dot M_{\rm char}\propto M_{\bullet}^\alpha \alpha^\beta$ and that can be understood based on analytic approximations we derive. We find that outflows from such disks are promising sites of r-process nucleosynthesis up to $M_\bullet \lesssim 3000 M_\odot$. These give rise to lanthanide-bearing 'red' super-kilonovae transients mostly for $M_\bullet \lesssim 200-500 M_\odot$ and lanthanide suppressed 'blue' super-kilonovae for larger $M_\bullet$. Proton-rich outflows can develop specifically for large black hole masses ($M_\bullet \gtrsim 100 M_\odot$) in certain accretion regimes, which may give rise to proton-rich isotopes via the $\nu$p-process.

 - **Abstract**
 General relativity treats spacetime as dynamical and exhibits its breakdown at singularities. This failure is interpreted as evidence that quantum gravity is not a theory formulated within spacetime; instead, it must explain the very emergence of spacetime from deeper quantum degrees of freedom, thereby resolving singularities. Quantum gravity is therefore envisaged as an axiomatic structure, and algorithmic calculations acting on these axioms are expected to generate spacetime. However, Gödel's incompleteness theorems, Tarski's undefinability theorem, and Chaitin's information-theoretic incompleteness establish intrinsic limits on any such algorithmic programme. Together, these results imply that a wholly algorithmic "Theory of Everything" is impossible: certain facets of reality will remain computationally undecidable and can be accessed only through non-algorithmic understanding. We formalize this by constructing a "Meta-Theory of Everything" grounded in non-algorithmic understanding, showing how it can account for undecidable phenomena and demonstrating that the breakdown of computational descriptions of nature does not entail a breakdown of science. Because any putative simulation of the universe would itself be algorithmic, this framework also implies that the universe cannot be a simulation.

#### Comment on "Quantum tunneling from Schwarzschild black hole in non-commutative gauge theory of gravity"

 - **Abstract**
 The particle creation via quantum tunneling was recently calculated for the Schwarzschild non-commutative black hole solution in Ref. [Phys. Lett. B 848 (2024) 138335, e-Print: 2310.02445 [gr-qc]]. Nevertheless, it contains inconsistencies in the calculations that need to be properly corrected. In particular, the event horizon was incorrectly determined in that work, which affected all the subsequent calculations. Moreover, the same issue have been repeated elsewhere by the same authors in Refs. [1-4].

 - **Abstract**
 In General Relativity, the static tidal Love numbers of black holes vanish identically. Whether this remains true for time-dependent tidal fields -- i.e., in the case of dynamical tidal Love numbers -- is an open question, complicated by subtle issues in the definition and computation of the tidal response at finite frequency. In this work, we compute the dynamical tidal perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole to quadratic order in the tidal frequency. By employing the Teukolsky formalism in advanced null coordinates, which are regular at the horizon, we obtain a particularly clean perturbative scheme. Furthermore, we introduce a response function based on the full solution of the perturbation equation which does not depend on any arbitrary constant. Our analysis recovers known results for the dissipative response at linear order and the logarithmic running at quadratic order, associated with scale dependence in the effective theory. In addition, we find a finite, nonvanishing conservative correction at second-order in frequency, thereby possibly demonstrating a genuine dynamical deformation of the black hole geometry. We then assess the impact of these dynamical tidal effects on the gravitational-wave phase, which enter at 8th post-Newtonian order, and express the correction in terms of generic $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients, which have to be matched to the perturbative result. Despite their conceptual interest, we argue that such corrections are too small to be observable even with future-generation gravitational wave detectors. Moreover, the corresponding phase shifts are degenerate with unknown point-particle contributions entering at the same post-Newtonian order.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the propagation of gravitational waves over a non-Riemannian spacetime, when a non-minimal coupling between the geometry and matter is considered in the form of contractions of the energy momentum tensor with the Ricci and co-Ricci curvature tensors. We focus our analysis on perturbations on a Minkowski background, elucidating how derivatives of the energy momentum tensor can sustain non-trivial torsion and non-metricity excitations, eventually resulting in additional source terms for the metric field. These can be reorganized in the form of D'Alembert operator acting on the energy momentum tensor and the equivalence principle can be reinforced at the linear level by a suitable choice of the parameters of the model. We show how tensor polarizations can exhibit a subluminal phase velocity in matter, evading the constraints found in General Relativity, and how this allows for the kinematic damping in specific configurations of the medium and of the geometry-matter coupling. These in turn define regions in the wavenumber space where propagation is forbidden, leading to the appearance of typical cut-off scale in the frequency spectrum.

 - **Abstract**
 We employ multiple-scale analysis to systematically derive analytical approximations describing the cosmological propagation of gravitational waves beyond general relativity, in a framework with two interacting spin-2 fields with time-dependent couplings. Such techniques allow us to accurately track the evolution of a system with slowly evolving time-dependent couplings over a large number of oscillation periods. We focus on tensor modes propagating on sub-horizon scales in a universe dominated by dark energy and explicitly derive solutions for a general class of models. To illustrate the possible applications of our general scheme and further corroborate our analytical results, we calculate the evolution of tensor perturbations in some phenomenological toy models and compare them with numerical simulations. We show that, generically, the interactions of independent spin-2 fields lead to non-trivial modifications to the amplitude and phase of the detected waveform, which are different from those obtained in other modified gravity theories with a single graviton. This provides an avenue to test and constrain gravitational models with new fundamental physical fields.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the Hamiltonian formulation of a spherically symmetric spacetime that corresponds to the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole. The resulting phase space involves two independent dynamical variables along with their conjugate momenta. We quantize the associated minisuperspace using the affine quantization method, which is particularly suited for systems with positive-definite configuration variables. We then explore whether the quantum effects encoded in this wave function can lead to the avoidance of classical singularities.

 We shall investigate the inflation for the D-brane model, motivated by the modified gravity $F(\phi,T)$. This gravity has been recently introduced in the literature. The feasibility of the D-brane inflation theory in the $F(\phi,T)$-gravity has been studied in conjunction with the most recent Planck data. We shall analyze the slow-roll inflation in the context of the $F(\phi)T$-gravity, via the D-brane model. Then, we shall calculate the inflation dynamics to obtain the scalar spectral index ``$n_s$'' and the tensor-to-scalar ratio ``$r$''. Besides, we investigate the dynamics of the reheating for this model. Our model accurately covers the left-hand side of the Planck data and the D-brane inflation.

 In this short note we find canonical form of Born-Infeld inspired gravity coupled to scalar fields using Faddeev-Jackiw approach. We show that canonical form of the action splits into two parts: First part has the same form as General Relativity canonical action while the matter part has complicated form as a consequence of the structure of Born-Infeld gravity action.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in noncommutative geometry and string theory have stimulated increasing research on noncommutative gravity. The detection of gravitational waves~(GW) opens a new window for testing this theory using observed data. In particular, the leading correction from noncommutative gravity to the GW of compact binary coalescences appears at the second post-Newtonian~(2PN) order. This correction is proportional to the dimensionless parameter $\Lambda\equiv|\theta^{0i}|/(l_Pt_P)$, where $\theta^{0i}$ denotes the antisymmetric tensor characterizing noncommutative spacetime, and $l_P, t_P$ represent the Plank length and time, respectively. Previous study have used the phase deviation from general relativity at the 2PN order, as measured in GW150914, to constrain noncommutative gravity, resulting in an upper bound of $\sqrt{\Lambda}<3.5$. Another analysis, based on multiple events from the GWTC-1 catalog, has obtained consistent bounds. In this work, we construct the noncommutative gravity waveform in the Parameterized Post-Einsteinian framework. Based on the \texttt{IMRPhenomXHM} template, we incorporate both the dominant (2,2) mode and several higher-order modes, including (2,1), (3,3), (3,2), and (4,4). We first reanalyze the GW150914 with a Bayesian parameter estimation and derive a 95th percentile upper bound on noncommutative gravity, obtaining $\sqrt{\Lambda}<0.68$. We then analyze GW190814 and obtain an even tighter 95th percentile upper bound of $\sqrt{\Lambda}<0.46$. This represent the strongest constraint on noncommutative gravity derived from real GW observations to date.

#### Black Holes as Non-Abelian Anyon Condensates: Nonthermal Spectrum and Implications for the Information Paradox

 - **Abstract**
 We model black holes as condensates of non-Abelian anyons forming a topologically ordered shell at the horizon. Combined with area quantization, the constrained fusion Hilbert space yields a discrete entropy spectrum consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. Assuming a quantized mass spectrum with nonuniform gaps, we derive a nonthermal radiation profile with a corrected Hawking temperature and entropy, including logarithmic and inverse-area corrections. This framework localizes quantum information to the horizon without invoking entanglement across it, offering a unitary evaporation mechanism governed by topological degrees of freedom. This offers a natural setting for resolving the information paradox without recourse to firewalls, remnants, or trans-horizon entanglement. We also show that the Hawking temperature arises from classical equipartition on the shell, explaining the thermal character of the spectrum at leading order. Overall, our results provide a microscopic, algebraic approach to the black hole information paradox and establish a bridge between quantum gravity and topological quantum computation.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed, mathematically rigorous description of the construction procedure of Penrose diagrams for the example of the maximal analytic extension of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. To this end, we first outline the basic idea underlying Penrose diagrams, state the general requirements on the spacetimes to be visualized, and give a definition of Penrose diagrams. We then construct the Penrose diagram of the maximally analytically extended Schwarzschild spacetime and discuss the characteristics and properties corresponding to this particular Penrose diagram. As an application, we work out the differences between the spacetime and null variants of the canonical advanced Eddington-Finkelstein coordinate representations of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime by explicitly constructing and visually analyzing Penrose diagrams equipped with foliations of the level sets of the respective Eddington-Finkelstein time and null coordinates. Throughout the course of the paper, we provide brief accounts of the relevant parts of the seminal publications on the exterior Schwarzschild solution by Schwarzschild himself, Kruskal, Eddington, Finkelstein, and Penrose. This paper is primarily of pedagogical nature aimed at graduate students in physics and applied mathematics (with a background in general relativity and differential geometry), serving mainly as an introduction to Penrose diagrams and coordinate representations of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine whether the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR) can be formulated as a gauge theory in the language of connections on principal bundles. We argue in favor of using either the affine bundle with the Poincaré group or, equivalently, the orthonormal frame bundle with the Lorentz group as the structure group. Following the framework of Trautman--where gauge symmetries are determined using the absolute elements--we set to identify the absolute elements and gauge symmetries of TEGR. The problem of a non-dynamical teleparallel connection raises the question of whether it should be treated as an absolute element. If so, the gauge group of TEGR is potentially some undetermined subgroup of the diffeomorphism group. On the other hand, if the connection is allowed to be non-dynamical but the only absolute element is taken to be the canonical 1-form of the frame bundle, we recover the whole diffeomorphism group as the gauge group of TEGR.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study excited states in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space prepared by local operator insertions of a massive scalar field, corresponding to operator quenches for free fields in AdS. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the time evolution of boundary observables in the dual states. We then introduce a hard wall in AdS Poincare coordinates to impose an infrared cutoff, creating a confining deformation of the dual conformal field theory, and analyze the dynamics of excited states in this confining background. By comparing the evolution of boundary two-point correlation functions in the deformed theory to the statistics of Gaussian random matrix ensembles, we show that for sufficiently heavy operators the fluctuations approach quite close those of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). Finally, we extend our analysis to the compact BTZ black hole and its hard wall deformation, finding qualitatively similar behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have demonstrated that AdS black holes possess the basic characteristics of a standard thermodynamic system. Concurrently, the thermodynamic properties of spacetimes featuring multiple horizons with distinct radiation temperatures have also attracted research interest. In this work, considering the high-order quantum electrodynamics (QED) correction, we initially establish an equivalent thermodynamic system for the coexistence region of black hole and cosmological horizons. On this basis, we conduct a detailed investigation into the thermodynamic properties of this dual-horizon coexistence region. Our results demonstrate that this equivalent thermodynamic system exhibits van der Waals-like thermodynamic behavior. Furthermore, we introduce a nonlinear parameter $\gamma$ to analyze its impact on phase transitions within the equivalent thermodynamic system. Under specific conditions, the system undergoes first- or second-order phase transitions for $\gamma=0$, and zeroth- or second-order phase transitions for $\gamma\neq0$. Finally, by utilizing the generalized off-shell Helmholtz free energy within the thermodynamic topological framework for black holes, we extend this methodology to investigate the topological properties of de Sitter (dS) spacetime. We compute the topological number characterizing the coexistence region of dual horizons in Euler-Heisenberg (EH) dS spacetime using equivalent thermodynamic state parameters. Additionally, we investigate the influence of the nonlinear parameter $\gamma$ on the thermodynamic characteristics of the equivalent system.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the extent to which the Swampland Conjecture can be employed to constrain large-field inflationary models from the perspective of quantum gravity consistency. In particular, we focus on the Swampland Distance Conjecture, which imposes an upper bound on the amplitude of primordial gravitational waves predicted by large-field inflation scenarios. This provides a striking contrast with the well-known Lyth bound, which yields a lower bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio in such models. The two bounds thus play complementary roles in assessing the viability of inflationary scenarios. We demonstrate that, for certain representative large-field inflation models, the Swampland Distance Conjecture alone can impose more stringent upper limits on the tensor-toscalar ratio than current observational constraints from the cosmic microwave background. These findings highlight the utility of Swampland criteria as a theoretical discriminator among competing inflationary models, independent of empirical data.

 - **Abstract**
 Holographic complexity, as the bulk dual of quantum complexity, encodes the geometric structure of black hole interiors. Motivated by the complexity=anything proposal, we introduce the spectral representation for generating functions associated with codimension-one and codimension-zero holographic complexity measures. These generating functions exhibit a universal slope-ramp-plateau structure, analogous to the spectral form factor in chaotic quantum systems. In such systems, quantum complexity evolves universally, displaying long-time linear growth followed by saturation at late times. By employing the generating function formalism, we demonstrate that this universal behavior originates from random matrix universality in spectral statistics and from a particular pole structure of the matrix elements of the generating functions in the energy eigenbasis. Using the residue theorem, we prove that the existence of this pole structure is both a necessary and sufficient condition for the linear growth of complexity measures. Furthermore, we show that the late-time saturation plateau arises directly from the spectral level repulsion, a hallmark of quantum chaos.

#### Entanglement Suppression Due to Black Hole Scattering

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the evolution of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory with a holographic dual. Specifically, we are interested in a class of excited states produced by a combination of pure-state (local operator) and mixed-state local quenches. We employ a method that allows us to determine the full time evolution analytically. While a single insertion of a local operator gives rise to a logarithmic time profile of entanglement entropy relative to the vacuum, we find that this growth is heavily suppressed in the presence of a mixed-state quench, reducing it to a time-independent constant bump. The degree of suppression depends on the relative position of the quenches as well as the ratio of regularization parameters associated with the quenches. This work sheds light on the interesting properties of gravitational scattering involving black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 As an exact count of protected states, the superconformal index provides a powerful probe into holography and quantum aspects of gravity, reproducing the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of supersymmetric AdS black holes in the large-$N$ limit. As a step toward understanding quantum black hole microstates, we study the finite-$N$ index of the 3d ADHM quiver gauge theory, a UV description of the 3d $\mathcal N=8$ SCFT dual to M-theory on AdS$_4 \times S^7$. In this note, we analyze both microcanonical and canonical features of the superconformal index. By computing the index to sufficiently high orders, we identify signatures of quantum black hole states in the finite-$N$ spectrum of the ADHM quiver, which align with the leading large-$N$ contribution reflecting the holographic dual black hole entropy. Furthermore, we introduce the complex-$\beta$ phase diagram of the index, which exhibits distinct peaks potentially associated with different gravitational saddles. To enable high-order computations, we employ the factorized index and also examine its Higgs branch Hilbert series limit. Our results demonstrate that the finite-$N$ index encodes rich information about black hole microstates and their quantum gravitational interpretation.
