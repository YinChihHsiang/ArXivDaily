#### Formation of massive multiple-star systems: early migration and mergers

 - **Abstract**
 Massive stars are often found in multiple systems, yet how binary-star systems with very close separations ($\lesssim$ au) assemble remains unresolved. We investigate the formation and inward migration of massive-star binaries in Solar-metallicity environments using the star-cluster formation simulation of Chon et al. (2024), which forms a $1200\,M_\odot$ stellar cluster and resolves binaries down to 1 au separation. Our results indicate that stars more massive than $2\,M_{\odot}$ predominantly assemble in binary or triple configurations, in agreement with observations, with member stars forming nearly coevally. In most of these systems, the inner binary hardens by one to three orders of magnitude and reaches a steady-state within the first $0.1\,$Myr. Notably, all binaries whose final separations are below 10 au are hardened with the aid of circumbinary discs, highlighting disc-driven migration as a key to produce tight massive binaries. We further find that binaries form with random inclinations relative to the initial rotation axis of the cloud, and that mutual inclinations in triple systems follow an isotropic distribution, implying that stochastic interactions driven by turbulence and few-body dynamics are crucial during assembly and migration. Finally, stars with $M>2\,M_{\odot}$ often undergo repeated merger events during cluster evolution, yielding extreme mass ratios ($q<0.1$). Some of these products may evolve into compact-object binaries containing a black hole or neutron star, including X-ray binaries and systems detectable by Gaia.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel and powerful constraint on the physics of supermassive black hole (BH) accretion disks. We show that in the outer disk (radii $R \gtrsim 0.01\,$pc or $\gtrsim 1000\,R_{G}$), models supported by thermal or radiation pressure predict disk masses which are much larger than the BH mass and increase with radius - i.e. rapidly-rising, extremely non-Keplerian rotation curves. More generally, we show that any observational upper limit to the deviation from Keplerian potentials at these radii directly constrains the physical form of the pressure in disks. We then show that existing maser and broad line region (BLR) kinematic observations immediately rule out the classic thermal-pressure-dominated Shakura Sunyaev-like $\alpha$-disk model, and indeed rule out any thermal or radiation (or cosmic-ray) pressure-dominated disk, as the required temperatures and luminosities of the gas at large radii would exceed those observed by orders of magnitude. We show that models where the pressure comes entirely from turbulence (without thermal, radiation, or magnetic sources) could in principle be viable but would require turbulent Toomre $Q \gtrsim 100$, far larger than predicted by self gravitating/gravito-turbulent models. However, recently proposed models of magnetic pressure-dominated disks agree with all of the observational constraints. These magnetically-dominated models also appear to agree better with constraints on maser magnetic fields, compared to the other possibilities. Observations appear to strongly favor the hypothesis that the outer regions of BH accretion disks are in the 'hyper-magnetized' state.

#### The Role of Interferometric Phase in Measuring Black Hole Photon Rings
 - **Authors:** Sol Gutiérrez-Lara, Daniel C. M. Palumbo, Michael D. Johnson

 - **Abstract**
 The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) captured the first images of a black hole using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). In the near future, extensions of the EHT such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) will allow access to finer-scale features, such as a black hole's ''photon ring.'' In the Kerr spacetime, this image structure arises from strong gravitational lensing near the black hole that results in a series of increasingly demagnified images of each emitting region that exponentially converge to a limiting critical curve. Exotic black hole alternatives, such as wormholes, can introduce additional photon rings. Hence, precisely characterizing multi-ring images is a promising pathway for measuring black hole parameters, such as spin, as well as exploring non-Kerr spacetimes. Here, we examine the interferometric response of multi-ring systems using a series of 1) simple geometric toy models, 2) synthetic BHEX and EHT observations of geometric models, and 3) semi-analytic accretion models with ray-tracing in the Kerr spacetime. We find that interferometric amplitude is more sensitive to the shape of the photon ring, while interferometric phase is more sensitive to its displacement, which is most sensitive to black hole spin. We find that for models similar to Messier 87* (M87*), the relative displacement of the first strongly lensed image from the weakly lensed direct image is approximately $1\,\mu {\rm as}$ per unit dimensionless spin, yielding an expected phase signature on a 25 G$\lambda$ baseline of $\sim44^\circ$ per unit spin.

#### Generalized Bondi Accretion Flow with and without Outflow

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.06397

 - **Abstract**
 The properties of accretion flows are affected by the angular momentum of the accreting gas. M.-G. Park found that the mass accretion rate, specifically, decreases significantly as the gas angular momentum increases. However, R. Narayan & A. C. Fabian found the decrease modest. We investigate global solutions for rotating polytropic flows in a much wider parameter space to understand their general properties within the slim disk approximation and a viscosity description suitable for both low- and high-angular-momentum flows. We find that the mass accretion rate for flows with a small Bondi radius decreases steeply as the gas angular momentum increases, while for those with a large Bondi radius, it decreases gradually. Therefore, the decrease of mass accretion rate due to gas rotation can be significant or mild depending on the Bondi radius. We further investigate global solutions of accretion with outflows using the ADIOS model of R. D. Blandford & M. C. Begelman. Stronger outflows in general slightly increase the mass inflow rate at the outer boundary, but the actual mass accreted into the black hole decreases by orders of magnitude. Stronger outflows also weaken the dependence of the mass accretion rate on the gas angular momentum when the viscosity parameter {\alpha} is small. The intricate dependence of the mass inflow rate at the outer boundary and the mass accretion rate into the black hole on gas angular momentum will have interesting implications for the growth of black holes and their energy output.

#### Ruling Out Compact Jets as the Dominant Source of Radio Emission in Radio-quiet, High Eddington-ratio Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of core radio emission in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is still actively debated. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations often predict the launching of moderately large-scale jets from super-Eddington accretion flows, but this prediction seems at odds with observations indicating most high/super-Eddington AGNs appear radio quiet. Here, we use the ratio of radio to X-ray luminosities as a multiwavelength diagnostic to probe the origin of radio emission in a sample of 69 radio-quiet, high/super-Eddington AGNs with black-hole masses $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5}-10^{9}~M_\odot$. With this wide dynamic range in $M_{\rm BH}$, we adapt existing formalisms for how jetted radio emission and accretion-powered X-ray emission scale with black hole mass into the super-Eddington regime. We find that the radio/X-ray luminosity ratios observed across this $M_{\rm BH}$ range are inconsistent with a jet-dominated model for radio emission. We discuss how our results may instead be consistent with a corona-dominated radio emission origin with a contribution from outflows at higher accretion rates.

#### Constraining Inflation Models with Spinning Voids

 - **Abstract**
 We present a powerful new diagnostics by which the running of scalar spectral index of primordial density fluctuations can be tightly and independently constrained. This new diagnostics utilizes coherent rotation of void galaxies, which can be observed as redshift asymmetry in opposite sides dichotomized by the projected spin axes of hosting voids. Comparing the numerical results from the AbacusSummit of cosmological simulations, we derive a non-parametric model for the redshift asymmetry distribution of void galaxies, which turns out to be almost universally valid for a very broad range of cosmologies including dynamic dark energy models with time-dependent equation of states as well as the $\Lambda$CDM models with various initial conditions. We discover that the universality of this model breaks down only if the running of scalar spectral index deviates from zero, detecting a consistent trend that a more positive (negative) running yields a lower (higher) redshift asymmetry of voids than the model predictions. Given that non-standard inflations usually predict non-zero runnings of the spectral index and that the redshift asymmetry distribution of voids is a readily observable quantity, we conclude that this new diagnostics will pave another path toward understanding the true mechanism of inflation.

#### Impact of a negative cosmological constant on the reconstruction of dark energy in light of DESI BAO data

 - **Abstract**
 An anti-de Sitter vacuum, corresponding to a negative cosmological constant (NCC), might coexist with one evolving positive dark energy component at low redshift and is hinted by the latest DESI observations. In this paper, we use two methods, \textit{redshift-binned} and \textit{Gaussian Process-based} reconstructions to investigate the effect of a NCC on the equation of state (EOS) $w(z)$ of evolving dark energy (DE) component. We find that a NCC is slightly preferred in both the two reconstructions by up to $\simeq1\sigma$. Although the degeneracy between the EOS of evolving DE component and NCC weakens the constraint on the reconstructed $w(z)$, this degeneracy leads to the phantom divide $w=-1$ more consistent with the 1$\sigma$ posterior of $w(z)$.

#### Evaluating the efficacy of a data cube treatment procedure for kinematic analyses: application to NGC 3115 and NGC 4699

 - **Abstract**
 Data cubes have been increasingly used in astronomy. These data sets, however, are usually affected by instrumental effects and high-frequency noise. In this work, we evaluate the efficacy of a data cube treatment methodology, previously proposed by our research group, for analyses focused on the stellar and gas kinematics. To do that, we used data cubes of the central regions of the galaxies NGC 3115 and NGC 4699, obtained with the Integral Field Unit of the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph. For each galaxy, we analysed three data cubes: non-treated, filtered (with the Butterworth spatial filtering) and filtered and deconvolved (with the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution). For each data cube, we performed a dynamical modelling, using Jeans Anisotropic Models, to obtain, among other parameters, the masses of the central supermassive black holes. Both for NGC 3115 and NGC 4699, the values of the parameters provided by the dynamical modelling from the non-treated, filtered and filtered and deconvolved data cubes were compatible, at the 1-$\sigma$ level. However, the use of the Butterworth spatial filtering decreased the uncertainty of the parameters. The additional use of the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution decreased even more the uncertainty of the parameters. The complete data treatment procedure resulted in decreases of 41% and 45% in the uncertainties of the supermassive black hole masses in NGC 3115 and NGC 4699, respectively. These results indicate that our treatment procedure not only does not compromise analyses of data cubes focused on the stellar or gas kinematics, but actually improves the quality of the results.

#### A New Consistency Test for the $Λ$CDM Model using Radial and Transverse BAO Measurements

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.07075

 - **Abstract**
 We present a calibration-free consistency test of spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM based on baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) distance measurements. The method forms ratios of BAO distances -- the Hubble distance $Ð(z)$, the comoving angular diameter distance $\DM(z)$, and the volume-averaged distance $\DV(z)$ -- so that the sound horizon scale cancels, and then maps each observed ratio to an effective flat-$\Lambda$CDM matter density parameter, $\OmL$, defined as the value of $\Omega_{\rm M}$ that reproduces the measured ratio within $\Lambda$CDM. Flat $\Lambda$CDM predicts that $\OmL$ should be independent of redshift and of the particular ratio used. For ratios involving the integrated distances $\DM$ and $\DV$, we associate them with well-defined effective line-of-sight redshift intervals using a redshift-matching strategy based on the integral mean value theorem. We apply the test to BAO measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release~1 and Data Release~2, propagating the full published BAO covariance matrices into all derived ratios and $\OmL$ constraints. Within current uncertainties, the inferred $\OmL$ values are broadly consistent with a redshift-independent constant, providing an internal consistency check of flat $\Lambda$CDM that can be strengthened straightforwardly as BAO measurements improve.

 - **Abstract**
 The high value of the cosmic microwave dipole may be telling us that dark matter is macroscopic rather than a fundamental particle. The possible presence of a significant dark matter component in the form of primordial black holes suggests that dark halo formation simulations should be commenced well before redshift z = 100. Unlike standard CDM candidates, PBHs behave as dense, non-relativistic matter from their inception in the radiation-dominated era. This allows them to seed gravitational potential wells and begin clustering earlier. We find that starting N-body simulations at redshifts even before matter-radiation equality yield galaxy bulk flow velocities that are systematically larger than those predicted by standard LCDM models. The early, high-mass concentrations established by PBHs lead to a more rapid and efficient gravitational acceleration of surrounding baryonic and dark matter, generating larger peculiar velocities that remain coherent over scales of hundreds of Mpc. Furthermore, a sub- population of PBHs in the 10^-20 to 10^-17 solar mass range would lose a non-negligible fraction of their mass via Hawking radiation over cosmological timescales. This evaporation process converts matter into radiation, so a time-varying matter density parameter, Omega_m', is introduced, which behaves like a boosted radiation term in the Friedmann equation. This dynamic term acts to reduce the Hubble tension. A higher effective Omega_r in the early universe reduces the sound horizon at the epoch of recombination. PBH mass loss also influences fits to the equation of state parameter, w, at low redshift. The naive N-body modelling presented here suggests investigation with tried and tested cosmology codes should be carried out, by introducing mass losing PBHs and starting the evolution as early as practicable.

#### Broad line regions behind haze: Intrinsic shape of Br$γ$ line and its origin in a type-1 Seyfert galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 The broad-line region (BLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is an essential component, yet its small size keeps its origin, structure, and kinematics uncertain. Infrared interferometry with VLTI/GRAVITY is now resolving BLR-scale emission, with data for NGC 3783 consistent with a rotating, geometrically thick configuration. However, the processes shaping the spectra remain poorly constrained, and the cloud models are tuned phenomenologically rather than derived from first-principles predictions. We address this by coupling three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of gas around a supermassive black hole with radiative-transfer calculations using Cloudy, comparing the results to the SINFONI Br$\gamma$ profile of NGC 3783. We find that Br$\gamma$ arises from ionized gas in the surface of the rotating thin disk, with electron temperatures of approximately $T_e \approx 10^4$ K and number densities of $n_e \approx 10^8-10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$. However, the intrinsic line profile produced by the RHD kinematics is narrower than observed and displays substructure. An approximate treatment of the electron scattering suggests that scattering in surrounding diffuse ionized gas significantly broadens and smooths the intrinsic Br$\gamma$ profile, making it consistent with the observed profile. This scattering medium has an electron temperature of $10^4 - 10^5$ K, and a number density of $n \lesssim 10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. Although a best-fit viewing angle of $\approx 15$ deg is suggested, the scattered line is notably less sensitive to inclination than the intrinsic line. The observed BLR profiles may be understood as the intrinsic emission viewed through an electron-scattering haze, such that some spectral detail is plausibly redistributed rather than seen directly.

#### Emulator-Based Inference of Cosmological Subgrid Models

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of structure in the Universe at large scales is dominated by gravity, with baryonic physics becoming significant at $\sim{\rm Mpc}$ scales. To capture the impact of baryonic physics, cosmological simulations must model gas dynamics and a host of relevant astrophysical processes. A recent extension of the Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code (HACC) couples its gravity solver with a modern smoothed particle hydrodynamics method. This extension incorporates sub-resolution models for chemical enrichment, black hole and star formation, AGN kinetic and thermal feedback, supernova-driven feedback, galactic winds, and metal-line cooling. We present an inference framework based on high-fidelity emulators to aid in model calibration against observational targets, e.g., the galaxy stellar mass function, radial gas density profiles, and the cluster gas fraction. The emulators are trained on simulation suites comprising 64 boxes with side-length $128\,h^{-1}$Mpc and 16 boxes with side-length $256\,h^{-1}$Mpc with $2\times 512^3$ and $2\times 1024^3$ particles, respectively. Our analysis reveals two distinct AGN kinetic feedback modes -- a low-feedback mode yielding strong agreement with the observed radial gas density profiles of massive X-ray clusters, and a high-feedback mode providing a better fit to cluster gas fraction data, but systematically underestimating gas densities in inner regions.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data reveal deviations from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, conventionally attributed to dynamical dark energy (DE). We demonstrate that these deviations are equally, if not better, explained by interactions between dark matter and dark energy (IDE), without requiring a time-varying DE equation of state. Using a unified framework, we analyze two IDE models--coupled quintessence and coupled fluid--against the latest CMB (Planck, ACT, SPT), DESI BAO, and SN (including DES-Dovekie recalibrated) data. Both IDE scenarios show robust evidence for non-vanishing interactions at the 3-5$\sigma$ level, with marginalized constraints significantly deviating from the $\Lambda$CDM limit. This preference persists even under DES-Dovekie SN recalibration, which weakens dynamical DE evidence. Crucially, for the same number of free parameters, IDE models provide fits to low- and high-redshift data that match or exceed the performance of the CPL dynamical DE parametrization. Our results establish IDE as a physically motivated alternative to dynamical DE, highlighting the necessity of future cosmological perturbation measurements (e.g., weak lensing, galaxy clustering) to distinguish between these paradigms.

#### Modified Gravity and the Origin of the Excess Radio Galaxy Number-Count Dipole

 - **Abstract**
 Recent analyses of wide-area radio-galaxy surveys have reported a statistically significant excess in the cosmic number-count dipole, with an amplitude exceeding the purely kinematic expectation of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by a factor of $\sim 3$--$4$, quoted at a significance level of up to $5.4\sigma$. While residual observational systematics and local-structure effects cannot be definitively excluded, this result motivates the exploration of alternative physical interpretations beyond the minimal $\Lambda$CDM framework. We investigate whether Scalar--Tensor--Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) can provide a consistent explanation for an enhanced large-scale anisotropic dipole without violating existing constraints from early-universe cosmology, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole, galaxy dynamics, weak lensing, or the observed late-time matter power spectrum. The radio number-count dipole probes ultra-large-scale, anisotropic structure and coherent gravitational response, rather than virialized dynamics or linear growth alone. In STVG-MOG, a scale- and time-dependent effective gravitational coupling preserves standard cosmological evolution at early times and on small to intermediate scales, while amplifying gravitational response on gigaparsec scales. This scale-selective enhancement can increase the large-scale structure contribution to the radio dipole without overproducing power on smaller scales. If the observed dipole excess reflects a physical cosmological signal rather than residual systematics, STVG-MOG offers a viable and testable alternative interpretation. It is demonstrated that the radio dipole anomaly provides a novel probe of gravitational physics on the largest observable scales.

#### Uniform models of neutron and quark (strange) stars in General Relativity

 - **Abstract**
 Models of neutron and strange stars are considered in the approximation of a uniform density distribution. A universal algebraic equation, valid for any equation of state, is used to find the approximate mass of a star of a given density without resorting to the integration of differential equations. Equations of state for neutron stars had been taken for degenerate neutron gas and for more realistic ones, used by Bethe, Malone, Johnson (1975). Models of homogeneous strange stars for the equation of state in the "quark bag model" have a simple analytical solution. The solutions presented in the paper for various equations of state differ from the exact solutions obtained by the numerical integration of differential equations by at most $ \sim 20 \%$. The formation of strange stars is examined as a function of the deconfinement boundary (DB), at which quarks become deconfined. Existing experimental data indicate that matter reaches very high densities in the vicinity of the DB. This imposes strong constraints on the maximum mass of strange stars and prohibits their formation at the final stages of stellar evolution, because the limiting mass of neutron stars is substantially higher and corresponds to considerably lower matter densities.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of cosmic rays from outside the Solar system are unknown, as they are deflected by the interstellar magnetic field. Supernova remnants are the main candidate for cosmic rays up to PeV energies but due to lack of evidence, they cannot be concluded as the sources of the most energetic Galactic CRs. We investigate discrete ejecta produced in state transitions of black hole X-ray binary systems as a potential source of cosmic rays, motivated by recent $>100$ TeV $\gamma$-ray detections by LHAASO. Starting from MAXI J1820+070, we examine the multi-wavelength observations and find that efficient particle acceleration may take place (i.e. into a robust power-law), up to $\sim2\times 10^{16}\mu^{-1/2}$ eV, where $\mu$ is the ratio of particle energy to magnetic energy. From these calculations, we estimate the global contribution of ejecta to the entire Galactic spectrum to be $\sim1\%$, with the cosmic ray contribution rising to $\sim5\%$ at PeV energies, assuming roughly equal energy in non-thermal protons, non-thermal electrons and magnetic fields. In addition, we calculate associated $\gamma$-ray and neutrino spectra of the MAXI J1820+070 ejecta to investigate new detection methods with CTAO, which provide strong constraints on initial ejecta size of order $10^7$ Schwarzschild radii ($10^{-5}$ pc) assuming a period of adiabatic expansion.

#### Induced gravitational waves - beyond linear cosmological perturbation theory

 - **Abstract**
 This thesis focuses on gravitational waves (GWs) that arise beyond linear order in cosmological perturbation theory. In recent years, scalar-induced GWs have attracted significant attention because they may serve as the observational signature of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe. The formation of PBHs requires large density perturbations, which can naturally emerge in some models of inflation. When these large density fluctuations couple, they act as a source for scalar-induced GWs at second order. In this work, we extend the existing formalism by including linear tensor fluctuations as an additional source term. This gives rise to two new classes of second-order GWs: those sourced by scalar-tensor couplings (scalar-tensor induced GWs) and those quadratic in tensor modes (tensor-tensor induced GWs). We find that the scalar-tensor contribution becomes significant if first-order tensor modes are enhanced, whilst the tensor-tensor contribution remains subdominant. Moreover, we demonstrate that the spectrum of scalar-tensor induced GWs exhibits an unphysical enhancement in the UV limit when the primordial scalar power spectrum is insufficiently peaked. To investigate whether this can be resolved, we study third-order induced GWs and their correlation with primordial GWs. We find that this new contribution suppresses the overall signal but does not cancel the unphysical enhancement. Possible explanations for this behaviour are discussed and left for future work. Finally, we explore the effect of primordial scalar non-Gaussianity on the spectrum of scalar-tensor induced GWs, building on previous results showing its impact on scalar-induced GWs.

#### Core Scouring Dynamics and Gravitational Wave Consequences: Constraints on Supermassive Black Hole Binary Hardening

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we perform a multi-messenger investigation of the efficiency of stellar scattering in tightening supermassive black hole binaries by jointly comparing models to the observed galaxy stellar core population and to results of nanohertz gravitational wave observations. Our model uses merger trees from the IllustrisTNG cosmological suite of simulations to predict stellar mass deficits in core galaxies. We take into account dynamical friction, stellar scattering, and gravitational wave emission and compare to the observed relation between core mass deficit and galaxy stellar mass. We find that to match observations, binary hardening in the stellar scattering regime must be about 1.6 times faster than N-body experiments suggest. Most importantly we find that, even assuming a full loss-cone, hardening by stellar scattering alone is insufficient to explain the low frequency turnover seen in the gravitational wave background. This strongly suggests that gas-dynamics play an important role in hardening and provides a reason to be optimistic about electromagnetically visible binary AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) are possible sources of a gravitational-wave background (GWB), detectable with the next observing runs of LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA. In case of a detection, it will be crucial to distinguish the possible sources of this GWB. One under-explored possibility is to exploit the duty cycle that quantifies the number of sources present in the time domain signal, which can be very different depending on the nature and population of the sources. We compute the duty cycle for a realistic population of PBH binaries, isolating the shot-noise, popcorn and continuous contributions to the GWB. We identify the dependence of the duty cycle on the signal frequency, duration and amplitude as a crucial metric for distinguishing PBHs from other sources in the GWB and constraining PBH models. Our work motivates the development of specific analysis tools to extract these observables, in order to unlock new cosmological insights with upcoming GW data.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper employs the backward ray tracing method to study the optical images of neutron stars under the conditions of a spherical light source and a thin accretion disk, considering a polynomial equation of state given by $p = K \rho^{1 + 1/n_c}$. By numerically solving the TOV equations, we obtain the interior solutions of neutron stars for different densities. The results indicate that as the polynomial index $n_c$ increases, the mass, radius, and compactness of the neutron star all increase, which has a significant impact on its optical properties. Under the assumption that the light is truncated at the surface of the neutron star, we find that for a spherical light source, an increase in $n_c$ leads to an enlargement of the Einstein ring radius. For a thin accretion disk, the light intensity always reaches its maximum at the surface of the neutron star. The increase in $n_c$ also causes the outline of the neutron star to grow. When the observer inclination angle $\theta_o$ changes, the neutron star's outline deforms from a circular shape to a D shape, with the left side being significantly brighter than the right side. In addition, this paper also investigates the distribution characteristics of the redshift factor. At lower observer inclination angles, gravitational redshift dominates, while at higher inclination angles, the Doppler effect induces noticeable blueshift. Compared to the Schwarzschild black hole, the optical appearance of the neutron star shows significant differences. The study provides a theoretical basis for distinguishing neutron stars from black holes using high-resolution imaging and for constraining the equation of state.

 - **Abstract**
 Testing Lorentz symmetry in strong gravitational fields provides a promising probe of extensions to general relativity. The supermassive black hole Sgr~A* and the orbit of the S-stars offer a laboratory for such tests in a regime beyond weak field limit. We analyze the S2 orbital data focusing on the Schwarzschild-like black hole within bumblebee gravity, where deviations from general relativity are encoded in a single Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$. Using a full 14-dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis under uniform and Gaussian priors, we obtain $\ell = {-8.01 \times 10^{-5}}^{+2.77 \times 10^{-4}}_{-2.09 \times 10^{-4}} $ and $\ell = {1.00 \times 10^{-5}}^{+2.90 \times 10^{-4}}_{-2.91 \times 10^{-4}} $ at $1\sigma$ confidence level, respectively. These constraints are about three orders of magnitude tighter than those from Event Horizon Telescope imaging of Sgr~A*.

 - **Abstract**
 The theory of $f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature (i.e. constant scalar curvature) admits rotating and charged black hole solutions obtained from the Kerr-Newman-(A)dS metrics of general relativity through appropriate rescalings of the metric parameters. In this paper, we focus on the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter case and present a unified analytic treatment of the horizon structure and its physical properties, allowing for a transparent comparison between general relativity and $ f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature. We solve the quartic equation determining the horizon locations and derive closed analytic expressions for the horizon radii. Focusing on extremal configurations, we obtain analytic formulas for the squared rotation parameter $ a^2 $ and the inverse square of the curvature radius $ l^{-2} $ as functions of the horizon location and the electric charge. For generic values of these parameters, the extremality conditions are non-universal, reducing to the familiar Kerr-Newman bound only in the limit of vanishing background curvature. We identify an ultra-extremal configuration in which $ a^2 $ attains its maximal value at zero charge and decreases monotonically to zero as the charge approaches its limiting value, while $ l^{-2 }$ increases correspondingly. As an illustrative example, we show that black holes with charge $ q=M/2 $ necessarily possess a minimum rotation, which emerges naturally as an intersection point in our analytic description of $ a^2 $ and $ l^{-2 }$, when embedded in a universe characterized by a critical value of $ l^{-2} $ (equivalently, the scalar curvature or the cosmological constant). Finally, we demonstrate that when the mass satisfies $ M^2= (a^2+q^2)(1-a^2/l^2)$, the quartic horizon equation factorizes, leading in the extremal regime to a chiral-like horizon structure that allows only the outer-cosmological horizon merger.

 We investigate the impact of gravitational wave (GW) dephasing due to gas accretion on the subtraction of massive black hole (MBH) binary signals over 4 yr of LISA data in the context of the global-fit. Based on state of the art predictions for the population of merging MBHs, we show that imperfect subtraction with vacuum waveform templates leaves a GW residual with an SNR of $3.2^{+5.4}_{-1.9}\times \sqrt{f_{\rm Edd} \langle \dot n \rangle/(20\, {\rm yr}^{-1})}$, where $f_{\rm Edd}$ is the typical Eddington ratio and $\langle \dot n \rangle$ the mean merger rate of LISA MBH binaries. We characterize the dependence of the residual on key population hyper-parameters, provide a simple fitting function and discuss detection and mitigation strategies.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes are among the most compelling predictions of general relativity (GR) and are now strongly supported by observations from gravitational-wave detectors and the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). While standard black hole solutions suffer from central singularities, regular black holes avoid this issue by introducing a nonsingular core. In this work, we extend the Dymnikova regular black hole to higher dimensions using a smooth matter distribution. The resulting spacetime features a de Sitter-like core and two horizons. We analyze photon motion and show that circular photon orbits remain unstable, giving rise to a well-defined black hole shadow. Our results indicate that the shadow size grows with the black hole scale but decreases slightly as the number of dimensions increases. We also investigate thermodynamic properties, including Hawking temperature and energy emission, and find a strong dependence on dimensionality. Finally, we compare our model with EHT observations to place constraints on the parameters and highlight potential observational signatures of higher-dimensional regular black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the concept of quantum atmosphere has been introduced as a potential origin of Hawking quanta. This study investigates the properties of quantum fields by exploring the quantum coherence of a two-mode Gaussian state near a black hole, where Hawking quanta originate from the quantum atmosphere region. It is demonstrated that both physically accessible and inaccessible quantum coherence for continuous variable quantum states distinctly exhibit hallmark features of the quantum atmosphere. Specifically, the quantum coherence for these states varies continuously with changes in the normalized distance; it undergoes rapid decreases (or increases) just outside the event horizon before gradually stabilizing through subsequent increases (or decreases). This behavior contrasts with the behaviors of quantum coherence where originates solely from the black hole's event horizon. The quantum features of the fields distinctly reflect characteristics attributable to the quantum atmosphere, thereby deepening our understanding of the origins of Hawking radiation. We also find that the continuous variable coherence is highly dependent on both the squeezing parameter and field frequency of the prepared state; therefore, appropriately adjusting these values can enhance our ability to detect features within the quantum atmosphere. It is noteworthy to observe that quantum features of fields do not entirely dissipate in the quantum atmosphere region, indicating that tasks related to quantum information processing can still be executed there.

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole singularity problem was proposed by Hawking and Penrose, and regular black holes serve as an important class of models to address this issue. However, the study of regular black hole thermodynamics has long faced a fundamental difficulty: an inconsistency between the Hawking temperature derived from thermodynamics and the geometrically defined Hawking temperature. To address this issue, we systematically investigated the thermodynamics of rotating regular black holes based on the method of thermodynamic phase space reduction. Our research shows that this approach naturally yields a self-consistent and complete thermodynamic description for rotating regular black holes, thereby establishing a universal thermodynamic framework for this type of black hole and laying the foundation for further research on complex thermodynamic phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 Two $F(R)$ gravity models are tested on the basis of their viability during all stages of cosmological evolution. It is shown that these models can describe both the early-time inflationary epoch and the dark energy epoch. The models are confronted with the latest observational data, including the Pantheon+ catalogue with Type Ia supernovae, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations, the Hubble parameter estimations and data from cosmic microwave background radiation. Investigation of the viability conditions for these models, in particular, the condition $\frac{dF}{dR}>0$ required a deep analysis. Both models appeared to be viable during the early-time era, but for the late-time evolution the viability conditions are not fulfilled in definite domains in the parameter spaces of these models. However the best fitted parameters, determined in confrontation with the mentioned observational data, lie far from the forbidden domains for both models. These $F(R)$ gravity models describe the observations with the large advantage over the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model, not only in $\chi^2$ statistics, but also with Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. This success of the two $F(R)$ gravity scenarios is connected with their capability to mimic dynamical dark energy, similarly to models with variable equation of state, that is necessary for describing the latest Pantheon+ and DESI observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 We study a generalized holographic dark energy model in which the infrared cutoff depends on the Hubble parameter and its first two time derivatives. The inclusion of the $\ddot H$ term introduces a finite relaxation timescale for the horizon degrees of freedom, which can be interpreted as an effective entropic inertia of the holographic vacuum energy. The resulting background dynamics admit late--time solutions in which the cosmic expansion gradually halts. In the underdamped regime, the Hubble parameter undergoes exponentially damped oscillations and asymptotically approaches $H\to0$. The scale factor grows monotonically but by a finite amount, while curvature invariants decay exponentially, leading to an asymptotically Minkowski spacetime without future singularities. We confront the full nonlinear background evolution with cosmic chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter and find good agreement with current late--time expansion data, with a reduced chi--squared $\chi^2/\nu\simeq0.52$. At observable redshifts, oscillatory features are strongly suppressed and remain consistent with existing constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 Balance flux laws of asymptotic symmetries in general relativity provide fully non-perturbative constraint equations on gravitational strain. They have proven useful for constructing numerical gravitational waveforms and for characterizing gravitational memory. As the precision of current and future detectors continues to improve, such constraints become increasingly important for high-precision tests of gravity, including searches for deviations from general relativity. This motivates a systematic understanding of analogous balance laws in theories beyond general relativity. In this work, we investigate the existence and structure of flux laws at null infinity in diffeomorphism-invariant extensions of general relativity. Our analysis is based on the covariant phase space formalism and the definition of conserved quantities, as presented by Wald and Zoupas. For a particularly relevant class of Horndeski theories, we derive a general expression for the flux and formulate the corresponding balance equation via the associated non-conserved charges. We cross-check our general results by comparing them with previous studies of Brans-Dicke gravity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the employed methods extend straightforwardly to a broader class of diffeomorphism-invariant theories. The null part of the resulting flux laws associated with null memory is compared with and validated against the alternative derivation based on the Isaacson approach to gravitational radiation. Beyond the specific results obtained, this work is intended to serve as a practical guide for computing balance laws in generic diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity and paves the way for an in-depth comparison between the Isaacson approach and the covariant phase space formalism.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking in bumblebee gravity modifies particle dynamics, thermodynamics, and vacuum energy around a static black hole background. Starting from the optical-mechanical correspondence, we derive a modified dispersion relation that encodes the influence of the Lorentz-violating parameter $\lambda$ on the propagation of massive and massless modes. We analyze the resulting optical properties, including the effective refractive index, group velocity, and energy-dependent time delay, and show how the non-asymptotically flat geometry reshapes signal propagation. From the same dispersion relation, we construct the interparticle potential for massive and massless excitations and evaluate the electron scattering cross section within the Born approximation, identifying characteristic Lorentz-violating corrections. We then develop a statistical-ensemble description based on the deformed energy-momentum relation and obtain analytic expressions for the thermodynamic observables of a massless bosonic gas. The pressure, mean energy, entropy, and heat capacity are examined in three representative regimes--extremely close to the horizon, near the photon sphere, and in the asymptotic region -- where Lorentz violation systematically increase the magnitude of these quantities and leads to finite asymptotic plateaus. Finally, we analyze the vacuum state in the curved background and compute the regularized Casimir energy at zero and finite temperature.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose the gravitational analog of the chiroptical effect for the first time, demonstrating that gravitational waves (GWs) can induce a reversal of photon chirality through the exchange of angular momentum, namely the spin-2-gravitation chiroptical effect. By analyzing the interaction between photon spin angular momentum (SAM) and GWs, we derive the selection rules governing this exchange, which are strictly dictated by the spin-1 and spin-2 nature of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields, respectively. We find that the gravitational chiroptical effect reflects the local nature of SAM which prevents the accumulation of gravitational perturbations over spatial phase windings, and offers a theoretically rigorous tool to probe the chiral structure of GWs. This mechanism provides a novel observational pathway to constrain modified gravity theories, measure the asymmetric properties of compact binaries, and explore parity-violating physics in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Einstein-bumblebee gravity, as a class of massive non-minimally coupled vector-tensor theories, provides a useful framework for constraining Lorentz symmetry breaking through astrophysical observations, largely due to the existence of exact static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions. These solutions are typically obtained under the assumption that the vector-field potential vanishes everywhere once the vector field acquires a nonzero radial vacuum expectation value. However, imposing this assumption globally obstructs the construction of self-consistent compact-star solutions. In this work, we elucidate the origin of this inconsistency through a detailed analysis of the field equations and construct neutron-star configurations by abandoning the global vanishing-potential assumption. Crucially, we show that even without enforcing this condition everywhere, it is violated only in the strong-field interior region and is dynamically restored in the weak-field regime by asymptotic boundary conditions at spatial infinity. As a result, consistency with existing black-hole solutions and observational constraints is preserved. Our results establish massive vector-tensor gravity as a unified, natural, and self-consistent framework for compact objects, significantly extending its astrophysical viability beyond black holes and Solar System tests.

#### A universal lower bound on the photon sphere radius in higher-dimensional black holes

 - **Abstract**
 The photon sphere, a hypersurface of circular null geodesics, plays a fundamental role in characterizing black hole spacetimes, influencing phenomena such as black hole shadows, gravitational lensing, and quasinormal modes. While universal upper bounds on the photon sphere radius have been established for both four-dimensional and higher-dimensional black holes, the question of a corresponding lower bound in higher-dimensional black holes remains less explored. In this work, we derive a universal lower bound for the photon sphere radius in static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes of arbitrary dimension $n\ge 4$. Under the assumptions of the weak energy condition, a non-positive trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and a monotonicity condition on the radial pressure function $|r^{n-1}p_r(r)|$, we prove that the photon sphere radius $r_\gamma$ satisfies $r_\gamma\ge (\frac{n-1}{2})^{1/(n-3)}r_H$, where $r_H$ is the radius of the outer event horizon. For $n=4$, this reduces to the known result $r_\gamma\ge \frac{3}{2}r_H$. Our result generalizes Hod's four-dimensional theorem to higher dimensions, and provides a new geometric constraint on the structure of black holes in extended theories of gravity.

 We model the inspiral and merger dynamics of two co-planar rings in Newtonian mechanics with GR motivated corrections and illustrate their similarity with those of black hole binary systems on the orbital plane. Our simulation reveals a banana-shape deformation of the ``black holes'' involved, and a typhoon-like spiral structure in the merger product. Using an eXact One-Body approach, we compute the full gravitational waveform of this process and qualitatively reproduce results consistent with those of numerical relativity. Our simulation offers a transparent link between the feature of gravitational waveforms and the internal structure of black holes, thus a complementary interpretation of physics behind numerical relativity.

Finally, we examine the periapsis shift and gravitational Larmor precession pointing out differences from the Ernst or Kiselev spacetimes.

 We construct a unified framework of geometrodynamics based on the Finsler geometry to reveal the relationship between spacetime and this http URL Lagrangian of electron in electromagnetic field as the Finsler function gives the Finslerian metric, which modifies spacetime metric in the Finsler-Randers space. The geodesic equation gives the effective mass, forces, and effective (or geometric) fields. Using the Chern connection, we construct the generalized Einstein-Maxwell equations. In the local natural basis, we give generalized Maxwell equations and wave equations. We find that the geometric field couples with electromagnetic field and gives effective charges and currents. We analyze several typical cases, such as flat spacetime, vacuum and Berwald structure. We find that the electromagnetic field vanishes, but there still exists the magnetic potential in the Berwald space. These results provide some hints to understand some puzzles, such as axion and dark energy. These formulations stimulate some clues to explore deeper geometric structures behind physical phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the Hawking evaporation history of low-temperature rotating black holes by taking into consideration the strong quantum fluctuations known to be present in the near-horizon, near-$\mathrm{AdS_2}$ throat region governed by an effective action that includes Schwarzian and two gauge modes. Imposing compatibility of this quantum framework with the semiclassical results creates a novel link between the particle angular momentum and the black hole electric charge before and after emission, leading to a nontrivial interplay between the superradiance effect and other channels. We evaluate single scalar (neutral and charged) emission of Kerr-Newman and single and di-particle emission of photons, gravitons and spinors in the Kerr spacetime. We uncover that quantum corrections may affect late time evaporation rates, which further slows down the whole evaporation process because of the near-balance between the $s$-wave channel and the superradiance channel. Specifically, we find energy decay of the form $E(t)\sim t^{-8/21}$ for scalar emission of a small, slowly rotating and charged black hole which differs from the analogous spherically symmetric quantum correction of $E(t)\sim t^{-2/5}$ already suppressed with respect to the semiclassical rate of $E(t)\sim t^{-1}$. We also discuss the quantum cross section for rotating black holes and point out various new features.

 - **Abstract**
 For the worldline theory of an extremal black hole, extremality amounts to vanishing ground state energy. In light of recent gravity results one would expect much like the ground state degeneracy this fine tuned condition too will not be met. It is unclear though whether this should be a quantum artefact or classical. In this paper we consider a non-BPS extremal four-charge Reissner Nordstrom black hole in N = 8 String theory. It is shown that the microscopic D-brane description fails to admit any extremal state, even classically. This positive energy is expected to destabilize the near horizon AdS2. The positive minimum energy is a direct consequence of the pattern of supersymmetry breaking by the D-branes. The black hole entropy is found to be the logarithm of the number of isolated minima and hence is related to the configurational entropy of the microscopic potential. We also find multiple continua of local minima corresponding to marginally bound states of the constituent D-branes.

 - **Abstract**
 For generic theories of nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) we investigate the restrictions imposed by causality on spherically-symmetric charged black-hole solutions of the Einstein-NLED equations. For a large class of (acausal) Born-type NLED theories, we find that the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) metric is an exact, but unstable, solution for some dyonic black holes. For all causal NLED we show that there are no regular black holes, and that the entropy of extremal black holes is less than the RN entropy for fixed charge. We also find the conditions for a parameter-space transition between RN-type and Schwarzschild-type global structure. For the transition from Schwarzschild-type to naked singularity, which occurs at finite mass, we show that the metric at the transition point is a Barriola-Vilenkin global monopole.
