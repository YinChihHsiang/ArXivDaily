 - **Abstract**
 We present a reverberation mapping analysis of the coronal line [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 emitting region of the quasar COS168 (SDSS J095910.30+020732.2). [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 is known as one of the "coronal lines," which are a species of emission lines present in AGN spectra with high ionization potentials ($\geq$ 100 eV) that can serve as tracers for AGN activity. The spatial extent of the coronal line region has been studied with only spatial resolving techniques that are not sensitive to the innermost regions of AGN. Through our reverberation mapping analysis of [Ne V]$\lambda$3427, we measure a nominal `optimal emission radius' for [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 of $381.1^{+16}_{-22}$ light days (observed-frame). We place the coronal line region in context with other AGN regions by comparing it with the characteristic radius of H$\alpha$, the dust-sublimation radius, and the dusty torus. The coronal line region is located at a larger radius from the black hole than the characteristic radius of the dusty torus, measured using a torus-radius luminosity relationship. The virial product ($v^2 R/G$) of both H$\alpha$ and [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 is consistent within the uncertainties, implying that the coronal line region, as probed by the [Ne V]$\lambda$3427 line, may be in a virialized orbit that is dominated by the gravitational potential of the black hole. This plausibly suggests that coronal lines could be an effective method for estimating black hole masses.

 - **Abstract**
 3C 84 is the brightest cluster galaxy in the Perseus Cluster. It is among the closest radio-loud active galaxies and among the very few that can be detected from low frequency radio up to TeV $\gamma$-rays. Here we report on the first X-ray polarization observation of 3C~84 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer, for a total of 2.2 Msec that coincides with a flare in $\gamma$-rays. This is the longest observation for a radio-loud active galaxy that allowed us to reach unprecedented sensitivity, leading to the detection of an X-ray polarization degree of $\rm\Pi_X=4.2\pm1.3\%$ ($\sim3.2\sigma$ confidence) at an X-ray electric vector polarization angle of $\rm \psi_X=163^{\circ}\pm9^{\circ}$, that is aligned with the radio jet direction on the sky. Optical polarization observations show fast variability about the jet axis as well. Our results strongly favor models in which X-rays are produced by Compton scattering from relativistic electrons -- specifically Synchrotron Self-Compton -- that takes places downstream, away from the supermassive black hole.

#### Tracking optical variability and outflows across the accretion states of the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of the minute-timescale optical variability and spectroscopic outflow signatures in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 during its 2018 outburst and re-brightenings. Minute-cadence, multi-filter optical light curves were obtained with the Las Cumbres Observatory network and the Al Sadeem Observatory (UAE) over 2018-2020, complemented by X-ray data from Swift/BAT, XRT, and MAXI. We also acquired contemporaneous low-resolution optical spectra with the 2.1 m OAN San Pedro Martir and OAGH Cananea telescopes (Mexico) and the 1.5 m G.D. Cassini telescope at Loiano (Italy). The optical fractional rms peaks in the hard state and is dominated by short-timescale flickering that strengthens toward longer wavelengths, suggesting that the variability is jet-driven. In this scenario, inflow fluctuations inject velocity perturbations at the jet base (internal shock model). The variability is quenched in the soft state, with any residual signal likely linked to accretion-flow fluctuations. This behaviour supports the accretion-ejection coupling in black hole binaries and shows that the jet's variability signature extends to optical wavelengths in all hard states. In the faintest hard states, residual optical variability may instead trace cyclo-synchrotron emission from the hot flow. The spectra show double-peaked emission lines and tentative cold-wind signatures during the hard state. Such winds were reported during the main 2018 outburst; here we find evidence of their presence also in later re-brightenings. Their absence in the soft state likely reflects stronger disc ionisation from the higher X-ray flux, suppressing low-ionisation optical features.

#### Updated Cosmological Constraints from 2D BAO Measurements: A New Compilation and Comparison with DESI DR2

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate and update observational constraints on cosmological parameters within the $\Lambda$CDM and dynamical dark energy frameworks, using a new compilation of the transverse (or 2D) BAO data, measurements that provide a relatively model-independent estimate of the BAO angular scale at a given redshift. Firstly, we assess the consistency of this compilation with CMB-Planck data and recent BAO results from the DESI collaboration. After confirming minimal tension with CMB data, we perform a series of joint analyses combining CMB data with the 2D~BAO compilation, as well as with several recent Type Ia supernova (SNIa) samples. In all cases, we compare the constraining power of the 2D~BAO data with that of DESI~DR2 samples. Our results indicate that combining 2D~BAO with CMB and SNIa data provides observational constraints that are competitive with those obtained using DESI~DR2. Although the precision of DESI~DR2 results remains higher, as expected due to the more accurate 3D measurements, the 2D~BAO compilation yields strong constraints. For example, in the $\Lambda$CDM context, we find $H_0 = 68.16^{+0.41}_{-0.37} \,\,\, \text{km s}^{-1}\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ (CMB + 2D~BAO) and $\Sigma m_{\nu} < 0.081~\mathrm{eV}$ (95\%~CL). These results are comparable to analogous analyses using DESI~DR2. Several other cases are analyzed and presented in the main text. Due to these results, we conclude that this new 2D~BAO compilation is both robust and competitive in constraining cosmological parameters, and, importantly, it does not exhibit significant tension with CMB measurements.

#### Accretion and Jet Coupling in Powerful Radio Quasars at Cosmic Noon

 - **Abstract**
 We present bolometric corrections, as a function of wavelength, for powerful radio-loud quasars from the Revised Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Galaxies (3CRR) at 1 < z < 2. The bolometric luminosities are derived by integrating the intrinsic accretion disk spectral energy distributions (SEDs) over the range 1{\mu}m-10keV (excluding reprocessed infrared emission) and integrating over inclination angles (to account for accretion disk emission anisotropy). We use accretion disk models, fitted to observed data, to self-consistently bridge the unobserved wavelength region between the UV and X-rays with no need for far-UV gap repair. The resulting bolometric corrections span a wide range (~1-400) across different wavelengths, showing minimal dependence on redshift, X-ray luminosity, and black hole mass, which is possibly due to a narrow range of these intrinsic AGN parameters in the sample. However, when the sample is divided by Eddington ratio, the X-ray bolometric corrections exhibit distinctly different values, with higher correction factors corresponding to higher Eddington ratios. We also examine the connection between total radio luminosity and accretion disk power. For most 3CRR sources, the radio power constitutes roughly 1%-10% of the accretion disk luminosity. However, quasars with compact jets exhibit higher radio luminosities for a given accretion disk power. This suggests a higher efficiency of conversion of accretion power to radio luminosity in the younger jets. Our results provide physically motivated bolometric corrections for powerful radio quasars that are applicable to powerful radio-loud quasars at any epoch.

#### An Overview of Rossby Wave Instability in Accretion Discs surrounding Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 The Rossby Wave Instability (RWI) has become an important concept in understanding the hydrodynamics (HDs) of accretion discs (ADs), especially in systems around black holes (BHs) where magnetic effects are either weak or absent. This instability is triggered by extrema (or sharp gradients) in the vortensity profile of the disc. Once activated, it leads to non-axisymmetric disturbances that can grow into large-scale vortices. These vortices play a significant role in the outward transport of angular momentum (AM). They may also help explain the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in certain astrophysical systems such as X-ray binaries (XRBs). Here we review the main theoretical ideas behind RWI, as well as findings from more advanced three-dimensional (3D) and relativistic simulations. We also mention how the theory has been extended to include magnetic fields and self-gravity(SG) and what these results might imply for actual observations.

#### How Fast Could Supermassive Black Holes Grow At the Epoch of Reionization?

 - **Abstract**
 Utilizing cosmological hydrodynamic simulations we show that there is a brief super-Eddington accretion phase in typical halos at high redshift, impervious to AGN self-regulation. However, once having attained a black hole mass of $10^4-10^5\msun$, AGN feedback process can self-regulate to guide the SMBHs to grow at a significantly slower, sub-Eddington rate. By redshift $z\sim 10$ the black hole mass with an initial super-Eddington jump-start is caught up by that in the case with a steady Eddington limited case. Thus a continuous Eddington limit case represents the fastest possible route to maximally grow SMBHs. To account for the observed $z=7-10$ quasars with supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses, our analysis establishes firmer ground for the need of seed masses of $10^4-10^5\msun$ that are not grown via an earlier super-Eddington phase.

#### Probing down to early cosmic epochs using limited redshift ($z\lesssim 1$) optical surveys with host galaxy age and lookback time analysis

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed analysis of AGN identification diagnostics and host galaxy evolution using optical spectral diagnostics using ESO-GOODS-S data. We employ traditional Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagrams along with their modern extensions, the Mass-Excitation (MEx) and Colour-Excitation (CEx) diagrams, to classify AGNs from among up to 600+ candidates. We extract the spectral properties utilising an indigenous spectral fitting code. In addition, the code also incorporates inputs from a state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis model (Bruzual and Charlot, 2003, MNRAS, 344, 1000), extracting the host galaxy ages and metallicities as model parameters. Redshift values for all the studied spectra are obtained from the literature. Using these redshift values, we are able to assign a 'lookback time' (using standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters). When this lookback time is combined with the galaxy ages (from spectral fitting), it enables us to study galaxy evolution even up to early cosmological epochs ($\sim$13 Gyr), despite restricting the studied field of galaxies to $z\sim 1$ (lookback time of $\sim$8 Gyr). We conclude that galaxies ultimately evolving into AGN hosts originate earlier ($\sim$8 Gyr ago) than non-AGN host galaxies ($\sim$6 Gyr ago). We relate this fact, that AGN hosts date back to an earlier epoch than non-AGN galaxies, as being likely due to higher cosmic temperatures at that time, probably enhancing black hole accretion. We emphasise that host galaxy age is an additional crucial parameter (apart from cosmological redshift) in defining our understanding of AGN and star formation co-evolution across cosmological time scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Variability studies are a powerful tool for studying the structures of unresolved sources. One such type of variability study, called reverberation mapping (RM), established that the dominant source of infrared radiation from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) was from dust absorption and re-emission, which demonstrated that the optical brightening and fading of light from the accretion disk (AD) around a supermassive black hole was followed by a corresponding (delayed) variation at infrared (IR) wavelengths from the surrounding dust distribution. Since that time a great deal more has been learned about the dust distribution around ADs, both near the AD in the form of a potential torus, as well as extended emission in the form of polar dust outflows. Understanding the dust distribution is vital to understanding how AGNs affect their host galaxy as well as the overall energetics of AGNs as ~50% of energy from an AGN comes out in the IR. Dust RM has been done exclusively in the near-IR (1-5 microns) which traces the inner edge of the dust near the dust sublimation radius. Hence extending RM to the mid-IR, especially to the peak of the dust emission between 25 and 30 microns, allows for an examination of the dust distribution around ADs and potentially traces the source of the polar outflow. RM with the proposed PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) can focus on variability monitoring of a sample of low- to high-luminosity AGNs to trace the 25-30 microns emission that is reverberated from the UV/optical AD emission which will be monitored by other space and ground-based observatories and made available to PRIMA users. Then, by detailed modeling of the response of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths, the distribution of the dust around an AGN will be revealed and can be linked to the accretion disk luminosities.

 - **Abstract**
 The dark matter track at ICRC~2025 showed a field in transition. Direct detection has entered the \emph{neutrino-floor era}, with XENONnT and PandaX-4T now limited by Solar neutrinos. Indirect searches have become truly \emph{multimessenger}, combining $\gamma$-rays, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and radio data under unified likelihoods and shared systematics. Non-WIMP candidates -- axions, sub-GeV particles, primordial black holes, macroscopic relics -- are becoming central. Across all fronts, progress depends as much on new detectors as on the coherence of shared data, methods, and analysis frameworks. Here, I distill the main experimental and conceptual shifts behind these trends, noting how assumptions have evolved since ICRC~2023 and where the next decisive advances are likely to come.

#### Clumpy Outflows from Super-Eddington Accreting Black Holes I: Radiation Hydrodynamics Simulations and Observational Implications

 - **Abstract**
 Recent advances in X-ray spectroscopic observation have enabled researchers to reveal distinct clumpy structures in the super-Eddington outflows from the supermassive black hole in PDS 456 (XRISM Collaboration 2025), initiating detailed investigation of fine-scale structures in accretion-driven outflows. In this study, we conduct high-resolution, two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations with time-varying and anisotropic initial and boundary conditions to reproduce outflows launched from super-Eddington accretion flows and analyze their statistical properties. The resulting clumpy outflows extend across a wide range of radial distances and polar angles, exhibiting typical properties such as a size of ~10 rg (where rg is the gravitational radius), a velocity of ~0.05-0.2 c (where c is the speed of light), and about five clumps along the line of sight. Although the velocities are slightly smaller, these characteristics reasonably resemble those obtained from the XRISM observation. The gas density of the clumps is on the order of 10^{-13}-10^{-12} g cm^{-3}, and their optical depth for electron scattering is approximately 1-10. The clumpy winds accelerated by radiation force are considered to originate from the region within <~300 rg.

#### Godel Universe in $f(Q,T)$ gravity: Exploring causality violation and closed time-like curves

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16090

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, the classical Godel solution from general relativity is extended into the framework of modified gravity theories based on non-metricity $Q$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$ in the context of $f(Q,T)$ gravity. The main feature of the Godel solution is the existence of closed time-like curves, which allow for causality violation and time travel. Since general relativity and its extensions do not demand spacetime to be globally causal, there is good motivation to explore such solutions. We have found classes of solutions with different matter content, like perfect fluid, cosmological constant, massless scalar field, etc. It is observed that, for suitable initial conditions, there is always a possibility of obtaining feasible solutions that violate causality in our setup. The presence of non-metricity in such solutions produces crucial deviations that are noteworthy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the state-of-the-art waveform model WaSABI-C for quasicircular inspirals of spinning black hole binaries with aligned or anti-aligned spins. Our model synthesizes the most up-to-date first- and second-order gravitational self-force results with high-order post-Newtonian expansions through a systematic hybridization procedure. This approach captures both strong-field and weak-field dynamics with high fidelity, enabling accurate modeling of spin-(anti)aligned inspirals across a wide parameter space. The resulting waveforms mark a significant advance in the precision of self-force-based templates, providing critical input for the detection and interpretation of gravitational waves from compact binaries with future observatories such as LISA and ET. We accompany this work with the release of WaSABI (Waveform Simulations of Asymmetric Binary Inspirals), a public package implementing our model for community use and further development.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent progress in gravitational self-force theory has led to the development of a first post-adiabatic (1PA) waveform model for nonspinning, quasicircular compact binaries [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 241402 (2023)]. In this paper, we extend that model to allow for a slowly spinning primary black hole and a generic, precessing spin on the secondary object, restricting to the case of small misalignment between the primary spin and the orbital angular momentum. We demonstrate excellent agreement between our waveforms and fully nonlinear numerical relativity simulations for mass ratios $q\gtrsim 5$ and primary spins $|\chi_1|\lesssim 0.1$ and arbitrary secondary spin $\chi_2 \lesssim 1$. In particular we present the re-summed 1PAT1R waveform model, which significantly improves the accuracy of the original 1PAT1 waveforms for comparable masses and increasing primary spin. Our models are publicly available in the WaSABI package.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we examine the geodesic and thermodynamic properties of a Schwarzschild black hole with a cloud of strings (known as the Letelier black hole) immersed in a King dark matter (KDM) halo under an isotropic configuration. The dynamics of both photons and massive particles are analyzed in detail using the effective potential formalism, including particle trajectories, the photon sphere, black hole shadow, and the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs). Particular emphasis is placed on how the presence of the KDM halo modifies these geometric and dynamical features. Furthermore, we explore the topological characteristics of photon rings by constructing a normalized vector field, following Duan\textquotesingle{}s topological current $\phi$-mapping theory, and demonstrate how this field is influenced by both the string cloud and the KDM halo. In the thermodynamic context, we analyze the impact of the KDM halo and the string cloud on the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, thermal stability, and phase transitions of the black hole. Finally, we examine the thermodynamic topology of the system using a theoretical framework that incorporates a generalized Helmholtz free energy and topological current theory. In both the photon sphere and thermodynamic analyses, we show that the string cloud parameter shifts the location of the zero point of the vector field in the equatorial plane. Specifically, in the photon sphere case, the radius of the photon sphere increases with increasing values of the string cloud parameter, while in the thermodynamic topology, the horizon radius decreases as the string cloud parameter increases.

 - **Abstract**
 Quantum effects are studied in both Schwarzschild spacetime and a spacetime in which a null shell collapses to form a black hole via the vacuum polarization $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ and stress-energy tensor $\langle T_{ab} \rangle$ for a massless minimally-coupled scalar field in two dimensions. For Schwarzschild spacetime, the Boulware, Unruh, and Hartle-Hawking states are considered. For the collapsing null shell spacetime, the \textit{in} vacuum state is used. Instabilities of the Unruh, Hartle-Hawking, and \textit{in} states resulting from the behavior of $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ in the regions inside and outside of the horizon are found. The question of how well the Unruh state for the eternal black hole approximates quantum effects in the interior of a black hole that forms from collapse is addressed.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamics of charged particles around magnetized black holes provide valuable insights into astrophysical processes near compact objects. In this work, we investigate the bound and unbound trajectories of charged particles in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an external, uniform magnetic field. By analyzing the effective potential and solving the corresponding equations of motion, we classify the possible orbital configurations and identify the critical parameters governing the transition between stable and escape trajectories. The influence of the magnetic field strength and particle charge on the orbital structure, energy, and angular momentum is systematically explored. Applications of the obtained results are discussed in the context of the S2 star orbiting Sagittarius A* and the motion of bright hotspots detected near the event horizon, offering a potential interpretation of recent observations in terms of magnetized dynamics. The study contributes to a deeper understanding of charged-particle motion around black holes and its relevance to high-energy astrophysical phenomena in the galactic center.

 - **Abstract**
 With the help of CUDA high-performance numerical codes exploited in machine learning, we investigate the shadow aspect of new rotating and charged black holes using the Dunkl derivative formalism. Precisely, we first establish the corresponding metric function encoding the involved physical properties including the optical character. Exploiting such accelerated simulations, we approach the horizon radius behaviors in order to determine the regions of the module space providing physical solutions. Applying the Hamilton-Jacobi mechanism, we assess the shadow aspect for non-rotating and rotating solutions. Using such an aspect, we evaluate the energy rate of emission. Developing a high-performance CUDA numerical code, we derive strict constraints on the Dunkl deformation parameters in order to establish a link with the shadow observations provided by the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration.

 We investigate the frame dependence of the Lyapunov exponent bound for charged particles in dilatonic Reissner-Nordström-AdS and Kerr-Sen-AdS black hole backgrounds, derived from Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory and the low-energy effective action of heterotic string theory, respectively. The analysis is performed in both the Einstein and string (Jordan) frames to examine the influence of conformal transformations on chaotic behavior. For massless particles, the Lyapunov exponent remains invariant under frame transformations, whereas for massive particles, it exhibits frame dependence owing to coupling to the dilaton field. Our results indicate sensitivity of the bound on chaos to the choice of frame. Depending on various parameters, the bound can be satisfied in the Einstein frame and violated in the string frame, while the opposite situation may occur for different parameter values. Numerical computations corroborate the findings of our analysis and demonstrate modifications in the chaotic behavior of string-inspired black holes induced by the dilaton field and the choice of frame.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper examines the growth of dark matter and dark energy perturbations within a non-canonical scalar field model characterized by an exponential potential. Through dynamical system analysis, we identify critical points and track the background evolution of a spatially flat FLRW universe dominated by dark energy and pressureless dark matter. We systematically derive key cosmological quantities, including the Hubble parameter, deceleration parameter, density parameters, and the scalar field's equation of state, and explore their dependence on model parameters. Within the linear perturbation framework, employing the pseudo-Newtonian formalism, we compute the growth factor of matter density perturbations. To investigate the non-linear regime of structure formation, we employ the spherical collapse model and derive its key parameters. Building on these findings, we compute the function $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$ and the relative number density of halo objects exceeding a given mass threshold. Our results indicate that non-canonical scalar field models can effectively account for both background cosmic evolution and the growth of structure, offering potential insights into observational constraints and large-scale dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive a modified dispersion relation for massive particles within the frameworks of five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory and general relativity, taking into account strong gravitational effects. The resulting effective mass depends on the curvature of the underlying phase space. Notably, in regions with strong gravitational fields, the effective mass may become imaginary, implying the possibility of particle decay induced by spacetime curvature.

 - **Abstract**
 We study electrically charged, slowly rotating black hole solutions in Einstein-Bumblebee gravity coupled to the traceless (conformal) ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics. By adopting a quadratic bumblebee potential that fixes the vacuum expectation value of the Lorentz-violating vector, we derive both the static configuration and its first-order rotating extension and demonstrate how the bumblebee parameter $\ell$ and the ModMax deformation $\gamma$ modify the horizon structure and the effective electric charge. We further investigate the dynamical properties of this spacetime by considering a massive scalar field perturbation. Using two independent numerical techniques, we compute the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra and perform a comprehensive analysis of the influence of all relevant parameters, including the black hole spin, the Lorentz-violating coupling, the ModMax deformation, and the scalar field mass. Our results reveal coherent trends in the QNM frequencies, highlighting the interplay between Lorentz-symmetry breaking and nonlinear electrodynamics effects in black hole dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by recent developments in Lorentz-violating theories of gravity, we obtain new black hole solutions within the framework of bumblebee gravity where the bumblebee vector field has two independent nonzero components and acquires either a lightlike or spacelike vacuum expectation value. Within this framework, we first derive new Schwarzschild-like and Schwarzschild-(A)dS black hole solutions. We first obtain Schwarzschild-like and Schwarzschild-(A)dS-like solutions in this framework. By further introducing a nonminimally coupled electromagnetic field, we obtain new charged black hole solutions. These solutions extend previous results through the inclusion of additional Lorentz-violating parameters. Remarkably, we find that even for lightlike vacuum expectation values, the black hole solutions retain corrections arising from the Lorentz-violating parameter. Furthermore, we present a preliminary analysis of the thermodynamic properties associated with these new solutions. Similar to previous studies that reported a mismatch between the black hole entropy and the Wald entropy in bumblebee gravity with spacelike vacuum expectation values, our solutions with spacelike vacuum expectation values exhibit the same behavior. However, we find that the two entropies coincide in the lightlike case considered here.

 - **Abstract**
 We report evidence for nonlinear gravitational effects in the ringdown signal of gravitational wave event GW250114. Using Bayesian inference, we find that the inclusion of a nonlinear quasi-normal mode (220Q), a second-order harmonic predicted by general relativity, is statistically favored over the standard linear model (440 mode) when analyzing the post-merger oscillations. Specifically, models incorporating the 220Q mode yield higher Bayes factors than those including only the linear 440 mode, and produce remnant black hole parameters (mass and spin) more consistent with full numerical relativity simulations. This suggests that nonlinear mode coupling contributes significantly to the ringdown phase, opening a new avenue to probe strong-field gravity beyond linear approximations.

 - **Abstract**
 Symmetry plays a crucial role in theoretical physics, especially Noether symmetry, which is a powerful approach for identifying the models at the fundamental level. The exact solution is provided within the point-like Lagrangian framework. In this work, we study one of the alternative theories of gravity based on the non-metricity scalar $Q$, namely $f(Q)$ gravity, via Noether symmetry. We utilize Noether symmetry within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity to derive the functional expression for $f(Q)$, which is given by $f(Q)=c(Q-nQ)^{\frac{3}{2-2n}}$. To confirm the exact solution of the model through Noether symmetry, we continue to consider the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology with the dynamical solution of the system using dimensionless variables and show that the accelerated expansion of the universe follows a power law scale factor. In the following, we show that the quantities corresponding to the exact solution for $n<1$ lead to an accelerated expansion universe. Finally, in the framework of $f(Q)$ scalar-tensor cosmology, we apply the Noether symmetry approach to find the cosmological models consistent with the Noether symmetry.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the existence of static, spherically symmetric compact objects within the framework of symmetric teleparallel scalar-tensor gravity. This theory extends the Brans-Dicke and scalar-tensor models within the symmetric teleparallel formalism. We consider a nontrivial connection that allows for genuinely nontrivial solutions in the limit of General Relativity. The field equations admit a minisuperspace description and by applying the method of variational symmetries we construct the corresponding conservation laws in vacuum. The application of these conservation laws enables the reconstruction of analytic black-hole solutions. Finally, we study the interior structure of compact objects matched to an extremal Reissner-Nordström exterior and show that the symmetric teleparallel scalar-tensor theory supports the existence of viable astrophysical objects.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate static configurations of dark energy stars within the framework of Rastall-Rainbow (R-R) gravity, which combines an energy-dependent deformation of spacetime with a nonminimal coupling between matter and geometry. We begin by deriving the modified field equations corresponding to R-R gravity and subsequently reformulate the stellar structure equations to describe hydrostatic equilibrium. The generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations are then solved numerically by adopting the modified Chaplygin equation of state to model the interior matter distribution. The R-R parameters, along with fluid constants, are shown to influence the maximum mass, radii, and stiffness of the star sequences compared to the baseline set by general relativity. We apply observational benchmarks from high-mass pulsars and binary-merger events (e.g., GW170817 and GW190814) to appraise viability within the explored parameter space. The results collectively suggest that stable, causal configurations arise from physically meaningful parameter selections, with deviations from general relativity leading to systematic changes in structural characteristics while adhering to theoretical limits. These findings illustrate that Rastall-Rainbow gravity can support stable, observationally consistent dark energy stars, providing verifiable signatures in strong gravitational fields.

 - **Abstract**
 The upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect up to thousands of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). These sources will spend $\sim 10^5$ cycles in band, and are therefore sensitive to tiny changes in the general-relativistic dynamics, potentially induced by astrophysical environments or modifications of general relativity (GR). Previous studies have shown that these effects can be highly degenerate for a single source. However, it may be possible to distinguish between them at the population level, because environmental effects should impact only a fraction of the sources, while modifications of GR would affect all. We therefore introduce a population-based hierarchical framework to disentangle the two hypotheses. Using simulated EMRI populations, we perform tests of the null vacuum-GR hypothesis and two alternative beyond-vacuum-GR hypotheses, namely migration torques (environmental effects) and time-varying $G$ (modified gravity). We find that with as few as $\approx 20$ detected sources, our framework can statistically distinguish between these three hypotheses, and even indicate if both environmental and modified gravity effects are simultaneously present in the population. Our framework can be applied to other models of beyond-vacuum-GR effects available in the literature.

 In this work, we study a Dark Energy (DE) energy density model which depends on the Hubble parameter squared $H^2$ and on its first, second and third time derivatives $\dot{H}$, $\ddot{H}$ and $\dddot{H}$. Considering a scale factor $a$ with a power-law dependence on the time (with $n$ indicating the power-law index), we obtain some important cosmological quantities as function of the , like the energy densities of Matter $\rho_m$ and of DE $\rho_D$, the fractional energy densities of DM $\Omega_m$ and of DE $\Omega_D$, the Hubble parameter squared $H^2$, the deceleration parameter $q$, the evolutionary form of the fractional energy density of DE $\Omega'_D$, the pressure of DE $p_D$ and the Equation of State (EoS) parameter of DE $\omega_D$, for both non interacting and interacting cases. For the interacting case, we consider 9 different interacting term $Q$, all functions of the Hubble parameter $H$ and/or of $\rho_m$ and $\rho_D$. Finally, we establish a correspondence between the DE model we study and some scalar field theories, including tachyon, k-essence, quintessence, Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI), Yang-Mills (YM) and Nonlinear Electrodynamics (NLED) fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding gravity is at the heart of some of the biggest questions in modern physics. While General Relativity (GR) is a theoretically unique and experimentally well-tested framework, it remains important to question whether it accurately describes gravity at all scales, motivating the exploration of broader theories. Black holes (BHs) provide ideal natural laboratories for testing gravity in the strong-field regime, and the recent advent of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has opened a new observational window into these extreme environments. In particular, the final stage of a compact binary merger$\unicode{x2013}$the ringdown phase$\unicode{x2013}$is of great interest. Here, the study of quasinormal modes (QNMs) offers a powerful tool to probe the fundamental nature of gravity and to extract intrinsic properties of BHs. This thesis investigates BH solutions and their QNM spectra within scalar-tensor theories of gravity$\unicode{x2013}$well-motivated extensions of GR that include an additional scalar degree of freedom. In particular, it focuses on stealth BHs, where scalar hair exists without altering the background metric but can modify the QNM spectrum. By analysing perturbations around such spacetimes, we derive forecasted constraints on beyond-GR parameters for current and future GW detectors. Three main investigations are presented: (i) a novel method to constrain the speed of gravity using ringdown signals alone; (ii) a stability and QNM analysis of BHs with linearly time-dependent scalar hair; and (iii) a general classification of stealth solutions in higher-order scalar-tensor (HOST) theories, including a stability analysis and identification of ringdown observational signatures. Together, these studies contribute new theoretical tools and observational forecasts that advance our understanding on fundamental gravitational physics in the era of GW astronomy

 In this paper, we discuss the Unruh state for a free scalar quantum field on Kerr-de Sitter under the assumption of mode stability. We summarise the proof of its Hadamard property that was previously given in [Klein:2023] for sufficiently small black-hole rotation and cosmological constant and show how it can be generalised to any subextreme black-hole angular momentum in the same range of the cosmological constant. This is done by extending a geometric analysis of the trapped set of the Kerr spacetime [Häfner, Klein:2024] to Kerr-de Sitter. Moreover, we discuss the application of this state in the numerical study of quantum effects at the inner horizon [Klein, Soltani, Casals, Hollands:2024], and describe a universality result for these effects [Hintz, Klein: 2024].

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we investigate the dynamics of a phantom scalar field with an arbitrary potential, focusing on accelerating scaling solutions of cosmological relevance. We consider both uncoupled and coupled cosmological scenarios. In the latter case, the coupling between phantom dark energy and dark matter is motivated by the warm inflationary paradigm, with the dissipation coefficient assumed to be either constant or variable. The evolution equations of our coupled and uncoupled cosmological models are written in the form of autonomous systems, whose stability is studied using methods of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. For this analysis, the only requirement imposed on the phantom scalar-field potential is that a specific dynamical variable, defined in terms of the potential and its derivative, must be invertible. We show that the uncoupled phantom cosmological model cannot accommodate any accelerated scaling solution, while such solutions do exist in the coupled scenario, for both constant and variable dissipation coefficients. Although there is a limitation to these scaling solutions $-$ specifically, the current stage of accelerated expansion is not preceded by a long enough matter-dominated era $-$ our results show that the existence of a direct coupling between phantom dark energy and dark matter yields great potential for addressing the cosmic coincidence problem.

#### Exorcising ghosts with gravitational waves: cases of ghostful and ghost-free fourth-order gravity

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17789

 - **Abstract**
 General Relativity (GR) is an effective field theory valid in the infrared regime. Quadratic curvature extensions intended to probe ultraviolet physics generically propagate a massive spin-$2$ ghost and are therefore non-unitary. One route to remove ghost is by enlarging the geometric sector (torsion, non-metricity). We investigate the infrared phenomenology of both the standard (ghostful) and ghost-free fourth-order gravity theories by computing Gravitational Wave (GW) emission and confronting the results with observations such as the orbital-period decay of quasi-stable binaries such as PSR B1913+16 and PSR J1738+0333 and the chirp-mass evolution of GW170817. In the ghostful theory, besides the theoretical inconsistency due to non-unitarity, there are also phenomenological problems: the massless spin-$2$ GW flux cancels the combined GW fluxes of the massive spin-$2$ ghost and massive spin-$0$ scalar in the vanishing-mass limit, so the GR quadrupole formula is not recovered at the leading order. As a result, we obtain the GW constraint on the ghostful theory as $m\gtrsim 10^{-11}~\mathrm{eV}$, where $m$ is the mass of the massive modes. By contrast, the ghost-free theory smoothly reproduces the Newtonian potential and GR quadrupole formulae when the two coupling constants $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ vanish, independently of the mass $m$. Therefore, GW observations put mass-dependent upper bounds on the size of the coupling constants. For example, if we assume $\alpha_1\simeq\alpha_2$ for simplicity, then we obtain $\alpha_{1,2}\lesssim 4.2\times 10^{83}$ for $m\sim 3\times 10^{-16}\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $\alpha_{1,2}\lesssim 1.3\times 10^{75}$ for $m\sim 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{eV}$. To our knowledge, these are the first astrophysical-scale bounds reported for ghostful and ghost-free fourth-order gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 Near-extremal black holes are known to contain strong quantum fluctuations in their near-horizon near-AdS$_2$ throat region governed by an effective action that includes Schwarzian modes. These fluctuations lead to one-loop corrections in the gravitational path integral that are essential in understanding the thermodynamics of near-extremal black holes at low temperatures where they become more dominant that the semi-classical answer. We explore the implications of these quantum fluctuations for near-extremal asymptotically AdS$_4$ black branes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We note that at one-loop level there is a coupling of the shear gravitational fluctuations to one of the would-be zero modes. This coupling affects the retarded Green's function in a way that leads to a low temperature violation of the shear viscosity to entropy density bound.

 - **Abstract**
 The BTZ black hole provides a tractable (2+1)-dimensional example for investigating string dynamics in curved spacetime. However, a systematic and robust analysis of the solution space of strings in the near-horizon region of BTZ black holes remains elusive in the literature. This work aims to fill this gap by employing the string-Carroll expansion. This formalism provides a natural setting for working with the near-horizon region, because near-horizon expansions for non-extremal black holes match string-Carroll expansions. Using this formalism, and expanding the string action and pullback fields in powers of an effective speed of light, we study the dynamics of closed bosonic strings in the near-horizon, non-extremal BTZ spacetime. Our approach classifies the general characteristics and further reveals some novel features of the families of string solutions.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct the phase diagram of supersymmetric ground states in AdS$_4\times S^7$ supergravity. BPS black holes exist only when the conserved charges satisfy a certain non-linear constraint. For other charge sectors, we propose two component configurations comprised of a core black hole that carries macroscopic entropy, and a gas that carries a macroscopic fraction of the charge. The superconformal index counts ground states only modulo a linear constraint on the charges. Each index line includes a pure BPS black hole but we find that, when differences between R-charge exceed a certain threshold, the index is dominated by a two component configuration. We illuminate this result by studying the gravitational path integral in Euclidean signature, as function of supersymmetric boundary conditions. We find that a pure BPS black hole saddle dominates the index when the R-charges are comparable, but not when they differ sufficiently. The region where the Euclidean path integral becomes unstable is precisely where two component configurations dominate the index. We show that the KSW criteria are insensitive to this instability.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive an explicit BRST-exact operator identity for the bulk Hamiltonian in quantum gravity, working within a BRST-invariant quantization of General Relativity, treated as a low-energy effective field theory. We show that, up to a boundary term, the Hamiltonian can be written elegantly as the anticommutator of the BRST charge and the temporal ghost field. This form makes manifest that the Hamiltonian flow acts as a time-reparameterization on the correlation functions of the physical degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that the BRST-exactness of the bulk Hamiltonian does not trivialize the time evolution of gravitational backgrounds or bulk correlators, nor does it trivialize scattering amplitudes.

 We investigate the short-interval expansion of the subsystem fidelity in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2D CFTs) using the operator product expansion (OPE) of twist operators. We obtain universal contributions from general quasiprimary operators valid for arbitrary 2D CFTs, along with specific results in free massless boson and fermion theories. The analytical predictions demonstrate excellent agreement with established analytical results in field theories and numerical calculations in integrable models. Furthermore, we extend the method to holographic CFTs, where subsystem fidelity serves to analyze the distinguishability of black hole microstates through the AdS/CFT correspondence. This work establishes a unified framework for quantifying quantum state distinguishability across various 2D CFTs, bridging quantum information techniques with applications in quantum gravity.

 We present the new version of FeynGrav, a package that provides a set of tools to work with Feynman rules for gravity models. The new version addresses two principal issues and includes changes that improve user experience. Firstly, we present a more sophisticated implementation of the BRST formalism for general relativity and quadratic gravity, which results in a finite set of interaction rules between ghosts and gravitons. We also implement a realisation of a higher derivative gauge fixing term for quadratic gravity. Secondly, we implement Feynman rules for Cheung-Remmen variables. These variables present the general relativity action in a polynomial form and produce a finite set of Feynman rules. Lastly, we introduce some minor quality-of-life changes to the package to improve the user experience.

 - **Abstract**
 Fractonic phases of matter, a class of states in which collective excitations with constrained mobility exist, have recently emerged as a novel avenue for ergodicity breaking and garnered broad interest in condensed matter physics. In this work, we consider a (3+1)-dimensional holographic model of fractonic solids and investigate the low-energy collective dynamics systematically. By computing the quasinormal modes of black holes, we obtain all the hydrodynamic excitations on the boundary, including two acoustic phonons, a longitudinal diffusive mode as well as a fractonic subdiffusive mode with the dispersion $\omega \sim-ik^4$. In addition, it is found that the fracton mode remains gapless when translational symmetry is explicitly broken. These results suggest that fractonic excitations are inherently protected by the crystal-dipole symmetry in solids and are qualitatively unaffected by broken spacetime symmetries.

 - **Abstract**
 We employ the island rule to study the radiation entropy in the background of asymptotically AdS black holes within f(Q) gravity. Through an analysis based on the Euclidean action, we find that within this framework the area term of the generalized entropy must be modified, leading to a corrected island rule. Using this rule to compute the radiation entropy in the eternal case shows that, although the result is time-independent, it diverges as the cutoff surface moves outward, indicating the breakdown of the s-wave approximation. For a collapsing black hole, the radiation entropy is dominated by the area term, with a logarithmic correction proportional to the area, which is consistent with the predictions of quantum gravity theories. Furthermore, both the radiation entropy and the Page time are ultimately influenced by the choice of the f(Q) model, implying that information about the underlying gravitational model is encoded in the final radiation entropy.
