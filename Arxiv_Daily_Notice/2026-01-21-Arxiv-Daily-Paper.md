 - **Abstract**
 The transient and variable optical sky is relatively poorly characterised on fast ($<$1$\,$hr) timescales. With the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), the Deeper, Wider, Faster programme (DWF) probes a unique parameter space with its deep (median of $g\sim22.2$ AB mag), minute-cadence imaging. In this work, we present DWF's first data release which comprises high cadence photometry extracted from $\sim$12000 images and 166 hours of telescope time. We present a novel data processing pipeline, $\texttt{dwf-postpipe}$, developed to identify sources and extract their light curves. The accuracy of the photometry is assessed by cross-matching to public catalogues. In addition, we injected a population of synthetic GRB afterglows into a subset of the DWF DECam imaging to compare the efficiency of our pipeline with a standard difference imaging approach. Both pipelines show performance and reliably recover injected transients with peak magnitudes $g<22$ AB mag with an efficiency of $97.24^{+0.7}_{-1.0}$ percent for \texttt{dwf-postpipe} and $96.14^{+0.9}_{-1.1}$ percent for a difference imaging approach. However, we find that $\texttt{dwf-postpipe}$ is less likely to recover transients appearing in galaxies that are brighter or comparable in brightness to the transient itself. To demonstrate the power of the data in this release, we conduct a search for uncatalogued variable stars in a single night of DWF DECam imaging and find ten pulsating variables, two eclipsing binaries and one ZZ ceti. We also conduct a search for variable phenomena in the Chandra Deep Field South, a Rubin deep drilling field, and identify two flares from likely UV ceti type stars.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. We investigate the physics of black hole accretion flows, particularly focusing on phenomena like magnetic reconnection and plasmoid formation, which are believed to be responsible for energetic events such as flares observed from astrophysical black this http URL. We aim to understand the influence of radiative cooling on plasmoid formation within black hole accretion flows that are threaded by multi-loop magnetic field this http URL. We conducted two- and three-dimensional two-temperature general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. By varying the magnetic loop sizes and the mass accretion rate, we explored how radiative cooling alters the accretion dynamics, disk structure, and the properties of reconnection-driven plasmoid this http URL. Our results demonstrate that radiative cooling suppresses the transition to the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state by reducing magnetic flux accumulation near the horizon. It significantly modifies the disk morphology by lowering the electron temperature and compressing the disk, which leads to increased density at the equatorial plane and decreased magnetization. Within the current sheets, radiative cooling triggers layer compression and the collapse of plasmoids, shortening their lifetime and reducing their size, while the frequency of plasmoid events increases. Moreover, we observe enhanced negative energy-at-infinity density in plasmoids near the ergosphere, with its peaks corresponding to plasmoid this http URL. Radiative cooling plays a critical role in shaping both macroscopic accretion flow properties and microscopic reconnection phenomena near black holes. This suggests that radiative cooling may modulate black hole energy extraction through reconnection-driven Penrose processes, highlighting its importance in models of astrophysical black holes.

#### Searching for Galaxy Cluster-Scale Strong lenses from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy cluster-scale strong gravitational lensing systems are rare yet valuable tools for investigating the properties of dark matter and dark energy, as well as providing the opportunity to study the distant universe at flux levels and spatial resolutions that would otherwise be unavailable. Large-scale imaging surveys present unprecedented opportunities to expand the sample of cluster lenses. In this study, we adopt a deep learning-based approach to identify cluster lenses from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, utilizing the catalog of galaxy cluster candidates identified by Zou et al. (2021). Our lens-finder employs a ResNet-18 architecture, trained with mock images of cluster lenses as positives and observational images of cluster scale non-lenses as negatives. We do an iterative operation to increase the completeness of our work, namely adding the found true positive samples back to the training set and training again for several times. Human inspection is conducted to further refine the candidates, categorizing them into grades (A, B, C) according to the significance of the strongly lensed arcs. Reviewing all 540,432 objects in Zou's catalog, we discover 485 high-confidence cluster lens candidates with a cluster $M_{500}$ range of $10^{13.67\sim14.97}M_{\odot}$ and a Brightest Central Galaxy (BCG) redshift range of $0.04\sim0.89$. After excluding the lens candidates listed in previous studies, we identify 247 newly discovered cluster lens candidates, including 16 grade A, 90 grade B, and 141 grade C. This catalog of cluster lens candidates is publicly available online, and follow-up observations are encouraged to confirm and conduct thorough investigations of these systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations of Lyman-$\alpha$ emission at $z \sim 11-6$ indicate a rapid reionization of the intergalactic medium within the first $\sim700$ Myr. The required Lyman continuum (LyC) photon budget may naturally arise from the unexpectedly high galaxy number densities revealed by JWST, reducing the need for scenarios invoking very high LyC escape fractions ($f_{\rm esc}\gtrsim0.2$) or dominant contributions from ultra-faint galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}>-15$) in the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework. In this work, we model the reionization history under the Early Dark Energy (EDE) paradigm -- originally proposed to ease the Hubble tension -- which also explains the observed over-abundance of high-$z$ galaxies without extreme star formation efficiencies. The EDE model yields reionization histories consistent with current constraints while requiring only moderate LyC escape fractions and UV luminosity densities ($f_{\rm esc}\sim 0.05-0.1$, $M_{\rm UV}\lesssim -17$ to $-15$). Our results suggest that, once key astrophysical parameters are better constrained, the reionization history could serve as an independent and complementary probe of EDE cosmologies.

#### Discovery of a gas-enshrouded broad-line AGN at z $\sim$ 7

 - **Abstract**
 The Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) absorption profile in star-forming galaxies serves as a powerful tracer of the extended, dense neutral hydrogen in their surroundings during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We report a unique galaxy, A2744-z7DLA, at $z\approx 6.87$ gravitationally lensed by the foreground galaxy cluster Abell 2744, which exhibits both moderate Ly$\alpha$ emission and damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption, suggesting the presence of a dense neutral hydrogen environment. Our analysis suggests that the UV continuum turnover near Ly$\alpha$ is more likely shaped by a damped Ly$\alpha$ system rather than nebular continuum from two photon process. We analyze the physical properties of A2744-z7DLA with spectroscopic and photometric data from the JWST and the HST. The galaxy shows a compact morphology ($r_e \sim 0.3\ {\rm kpc}$) and a broadened H$\alpha$ emission line, suggesting possible AGN activity. The broad component of H$\alpha$ has a FWHM of $2721 \pm 200\ {\rm km\ s^{-1}}$, corresponding to a black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH}=2.90^{+2.35}_{-1.28}\times 10^7 M_\odot$ and a black hole-to-stellar mass ratio of $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm stellar}) = -1.58^{+0.45}_{-0.34}$. The Balmer decrement ($\rm H\alpha/H\beta$) yields a dust attenuation of $\rm A_V \approx 1.15 \pm 0.23$, indicating that this system is less dust-rich than some "little red dots". Furthermore, we perform SED fitting using both stellar and AGN models. The results show that the UV and optical wavelengths are dominated by star-forming regions, while the AGN component contributes primarily at longer wavelengths. This work provides new insights into the interplay between star formation, neutral gas, and potential AGN activity in galaxies during the EoR.

#### Little Red Dots as Hidden Neutrino Sources

 - **Abstract**
 Little Red Dots (LRDs) are enigmatic, compact, red galaxies at high redshift, $z\sim 4$-$7$, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope. Broad emission lines in the absence of X-ray and radio counterparts suggest that they host accreting supermassive black holes embedded in dense gaseous envelopes. This black-hole-envelope configuration facilitates efficient photohadronic interactions and neutrino production. Remarkably, their observed source number density and luminosity are compatible with the energetics of the diffuse neutrino background. We consider that relativistic jets and outflows are launched from the black hole and propagate through low-density polar funnels within envelopes, where particle acceleration and neutrino emission occur. This leads to LRDs being effectively hidden sources. Our analytic and numerical calculations show that, in an optimistic scenario, LRDs can contribute $\sim 30\%$ of the observed diffuse background at TeV$-$sub-PeV energies, predominantly through photomeson production. At high neutrino energies, $\gtrsim 10^{5.5}~{\rm GeV}$, inverse-Compton cooling of muons modifies the resulting flavor ratio, providing a distinctive diagnostic for IceCube-Gen2 and other upcoming neutrino telescopes.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11270

 - **Abstract**
 The influences on the cluster number counts from the coupling between dark energy and dark matter with momentum transfer are investigated. We find that the extrapolated linear density contrast computed from the spherical collapse model is suppressed when the strength of momentum transfer is increased. Using the Sheth-Tormen mass function, the cluster number counts are computed. The minimum mass limit in the mass integration for each redshift bin is determined by matching the predicted number counts from the $\Lambda$CDM model with the result from eROSITA surveys. We find that the number of clusters is maximal at a higher redshift bin, and the number of clusters in a maximum redshift bin is enhanced when the strength of momentum and energy transfers increases due to the reduction of extrapolated linear density contrast. Setting the parameters of the dark energy model with momentum coupling according to the observational constraints in \cite{bestfit}, the predicted number counts from the coupled dark energy is larger than the result from eROSITA surveys. The statistical analysis yields a $p$-value of 0.189 for the proposed model relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Consequently, there is no statistically significant evidence of an improved fit over the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework based on the eROSITA cluster number counts.

 - **Abstract**
 Although the migration of hot Jupiters is not yet fully understood, measurements of the projected spin-orbit angle {\lambda} help shed light on the processes involved. Here we present Doppler tomography of three known hot Jupiters to determine their {\lambda} orientation: HAT-P-49 b, HAT-P-57A b, and XO-3A b. Our analysis explores the impact of cross-correlation processing methods on the detectability and characterization of the planet's Doppler shadow using up to three independent routines for cross-correlation functions extraction; those being: Yabi, iSpec and IRAF. After accounting for differences among the results obtained with the various routines, we report: first, the HAT-P-49 system is a case of a hot Jupiter on a polar orbit with {\lambda}=-85.3{\pm}1.7°, second, HAT-P-57A indicates practically no deviation of the planet's projected orbit from the host's equatorial plane with {\lambda}=-0.4^{+1.4}_{-1.9}°, and third, the XO-3A system with the measured value of {\lambda}=38{+3}_{-4}° lies in between an aligned and a perpendicular orientation, which is a less populated region of the spin-orbit distribution. Our findings highlight both the diversity of spin-orbit angles among close-in giant planets and the potential discrepancies in their measurement that can arise from different approaches to constructing the cross-correlation functions.

#### Central flashes during stellar occultations. Effects of diffraction, interferences, and stellar diameter

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11380

 - **Abstract**
 Central flashes occur during stellar occultations by solar system objects. We catalog diffraction effects on the flash with point-like stars, monochromatic waves and spherical transparent atmosphere. Diffraction involves the Huygens principle, the Sommerfeld lemma and the stationary phase method, while finite stellar diameter cases involve Clausius' theorem. For point-like stars, the central flash shape is that of the classical Poisson spot, but with larger height. For tenuous atmospheres that cannot focus the stellar rays at shadow center, the flash is amplified by the factor (R_0/r_0)^2 compared to the Poisson spot, where R0 and r0 are the object and the shadow radii, respectively. For denser atmospheres that can focus the rays at shadow center, the flash peaks at 2[(pi*R/lambda_F})^2]*phi0, where R is the central flash layer radius, lambda_F is the Fresnel scale and phi0 is the flux that would be observed at shadow center without focusing. For isothermal atmospheres with scale height H, the height is 2(R*H)(pi/lambda_F)^2. Fringes surrounding the central flash are separated by lambda_P=lambda_F^2/R, related to the separation between the primary and secondary stellar images. For a projected stellar diameter D*>lambda_P, the flash is described by complete elliptic integrals, and has full width at half maximum of 1.14D* and peak value 8H/D*. For Earth-based occultations by Pluto and Triton observed in the visible with point-like stars, diffraction causes flashes with very large heights ~10e4-10e5, spread over a very small meter-sized region in the shadow plane. In practice, the flash is usually smoothed by the stellar diameter, but still reaches high values of ~50 and ~200 during Pluto and Triton occultations, respectively. Diffraction dominates when using millimeter wavelengths or longer. Effects of departure from sphericity, atmospheric waves and stellar limb darkening are discussed.

#### Pseudo Little Red Dot: an Active Black Hole Embedded in a Dense and Dusty, Metal-Poor Starburst Galaxy at z=5.96

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11466

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study of Pseudo-LRD-NOM (Pseudo little red dot with no metal lines), a highly magnified low-mass galaxy behind the lensing cluster Abell 370 at z=5.96. We classify this object as a pseudo-LRD because its red rest-frame optical colour is mainly driven by a prominent Halpha line (with EW0 >~ 800 Angstroms) present in its JWST NIRSpec spectrum. Halpha is dominated by a narrow component and also has a minor broad component indicative of an active black hole with M_BH = 2.9x10^6 Msun. A narrow Hbeta emission line is also detected (with S/N = 8), producing a Balmer decrement (narrow) Halpha/Hbeta = 11. The rest-frame UV spectral slope is beta_UVspec = -1.2. All these features can be ascribed to high dust attenuation. However, no [OIII]5007 or any other metal lines are detected in the spectrum, so [OIII]5007/Hbeta < 0.25, at odds with a simple dust-attenuation explanation. Accounting for all the spectral properties requires the model of a starburst with moderate colour excess E(B-V)=0.18-0.45, high gas density (n_H >~ 10^6 cm^{-3}) and extremely low gas/stellar metallicities (Z = 0.01-0.1 Zsun). The demagnified stellar mass is 1.62^{+1.54}_{-0.79} x10^7 Msun and the stellar-mass surface density is Sigma* = 418^{+725}_{-310} Msun/pc^2, similar to that of massive/nuclear star clusters. Pseudo-LRD-NOM provides evidence of massive black-hole growth occurring in a high-density, dusty starburst which is at the early stages of its chemical enrichment, and is likely a precursor to a real LRD.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole has been recently introduced as a geodesically complete spacetime featuring a signature shift at the event horizon where causal geodesics are precluded from reaching the central $r=0$ singularity. In this paper, we investigate the shadows produced by this geometry to identify deviations from the standard Schwarzschild solution. Our analysis reveals an excess intensity in the inner shadow region that points to a potential observational signature of the novel behavior of light rays propagating near the event horizon. This excess could be a probe for horizon-scale modifications of black hole geometries. Furthermore, although the horizon surface of the Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole continuously accumulates photons and energy, we show that its backreaction response differs from that of stable light rings found in various exotic compact objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive the master equations governing axial and polar gravitational perturbations of a generic static and spherically symmetric black hole spacetime within the framework of the revised Deser--Woodard nonlocal gravity theory. We then apply our general formalism to a one-parameter family of black hole solutions recently obtained by the present authors, representing small first-order deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry. We provide well-motivated arguments that allow us to render the analysis analytically tractable. Our results provide the first complete perturbative characterization of nonlocal black holes and lay the groundwork for future investigations.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute, at the first self force accuracy level, the radiated energy from a radially infalling particle released from rest in a Schwarzschild spacetime. We examine both the cases of a scalar particle and that of a massive particle, in the context of gravitational perturbations. Our findings are accompanied by Post-Newtonian checks. In spite of the specific interest for this kind of computations, we outline the building blocks for future higher-order Post-Newtonian computations as well as for extending these results to other interesting situations out of the black hole case.

#### Rapid inference of gravitational-wave signals in the time domain using a heterodyned likelihood

 - **Abstract**
 Parameter estimation of gravitational wave signals is computationally intensive and typically requires millions of likelihood evaluations to construct posterior probability distributions. This computational cost increases significantly in the time domain, which requires non-diagonal covariance matrices to compute the likelihood. Consequently, parameter estimation of long-duration gravitational wave signals, such as binary neutron star mergers, becomes computationally infeasible in time domain. In this work, we detail a framework for the heterodyned likelihood that enables rapid inference in the time domain. Our method is applicable to signals with arbitrary mode content, and leverages the smoothness of the ratio of complex-valued waveform modes, approximating the ratio as a linear function within appropriately chosen time bins. This allows downsampling of the waveform modes and a reformulation of the likelihood, such that it depends only on the bin edges. We demonstrate that this likelihood recovers posteriors that are indistinguishable from those obtained using the standard likelihood in the time domain. We also observe dramatic improvement in speed - for a 128 seconds-long gravitational wave signal, our method is at least $\sim 400$ times faster than the standard time-domain analysis, reducing the wall clock time to just a few hours. We also demonstrate the reliability and unbiasedness of the likelihood using percentile-percentile tests for binary black hole and binary neutron star injections. We use the Gohberg-Semencul representation of the inverse of Toeplitz covariance matrix to accelerate matrix-vector products, which has potential applications even in non heterodyned time-domain inference.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the long-duration time-domain simulations of scalar-field tails in Kerr spacetimes driven by \emph{outgoing} multipolar sources. Extending the recent work in the literature from Schwarzschild to rotating black holes, we evolve sources with $\ell'=\{0,1,2,3,4\}$ on backgrounds with dimensionless spin $a/M=\{0.0, 0.8, 1.0\}$ and extract the late-time decay rates of measured modes $\ell\le4$ for a nonlinearity-inspired outgoing source with a $1/r^2$ fall-off. In all cases we find the inverse power-law index $p_{\ell\ell'}$ to be larger than the source-free Price law values by one unit, i.e. $p^{\text{sourced}}_{\ell\ell'} = p^{\text{Price}}_{\ell\ell'} + 1$. We also include a power-law index value computation for a similar source-driven gravitational wave case $(\ell,m)=(4,4)$ and confirm closely related results in the recent literature.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a large number of exact solutions of three-dimensional gravity with heavy matter particles that generalize the construction of Antonini, Sasieta, and Swingle (AS${}^2$), argued to define CFT states dual to a spacetime with a closed baby universe cosmology. Our construction starts with an arbitrary heavy-particle closed universe cosmology of the type constructed in arXiv:2503.12227, and via a gluing procedure adds an arbitrary number of AdS tubes connecting the past and future conformal boundaries of the associated Euclidean wormhole solution. With our construction, it is straightforward to produce examples where the cosmology is approximately homogeneous and isotropic. We describe a necessary condition for the cosmological wormhole saddle to dominate the Euclidean path integral with the specified boundary conditions. We argue that the original AS${}^2$ construction usually does not meet this condition, and describe alternative saddles that are likely to dominate. We discuss various possibilities for how the cosmological saddle might be made to dominate in our generalized construction.

#### Confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in holography: a smooth switch-off

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the holographic description of the thermal first order phase transition of N=4 SYM compactified on a spatial circle. At the transition, the dominant bulk saddle exchanges between a geometry with a compact spatial circle and one with a compact Euclidean time circle. We construct a one-parameter family of Euclidean geometries that describes the unstable branch of the transition, completing the swallow-tail structure of the free energy. Although these configurations are thermodynamically unstable, they provide a continuous interpolation between the confining soliton and the deconfined black hole phases. Using probe fundamental strings, we show that the theory remains confining along the unstable branch, with a string tension that decreases smoothly and vanishes only in the black hole limit. Introducing fundamental matter via probe D5-branes, we find that chiral symmetry breaking follows the same pattern: the condensate decreases continuously and switches off precisely where confinement disappears. We discuss the implications for the confinement and chiral symmetry breaking mechanisms at large Nc.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we develop an algebraic description of the Page transition, a key feature in black hole evaporation where the entropy of Hawking radiation follows a unitary Page curve instead of monotonically increasing. By applying concepts from approximate quantum error correction with complementary recovery, we characterize the Page transition as a phase transition in channel recovery. We then generalize the description to infinite-dimensional settings using algebraic relative entropy, which remains valid even in type III factors. For type I/II factors, explicit probes based on relative entropy differences are derived, serving as indicators for the transition at the Page time.
