 - **Abstract**
 String theory naturally leads to the expectation that dark energy is not stable, and may be evolving as captured by the Swampland de Sitter conjectures. Moreover, motivated by the distance conjecture a unification of dark sector has been proposed, where the smallness of dark energy leads to one extra dimension of micron size with dark matter being the KK graviton excitations in this extra dimension. We consider the natural possibility that the radius of the dark dimension varies as the dark energy decreases, leading to the variation of the dark matter mass. This correlates the decrease of the dark energy with the variation of the dark matter mass as they depend on the variations of a scalar field $\phi$ controlling the radius of the extra dimension. A simple realization of this idea for small range of $\phi$ is captured by choosing a potential which is locally of the form $V=V_0\ {\rm exp}(-c\phi)$ and dark matter mass $m_{\rm DM}=m_0\ {\rm exp}(-c' \phi)$ where the sign of $\phi$ is chosen such that $c'\geq 0$ while we have two choices for the sign of $c$ depending on whether the dark dimension expands or shrinks when the dark energy dominates. We find excellent agreement with recent experimental data from DESI DR2 combined with SN measurements and reproduces the same significance as CPL parametrization with the added benefit of providing a natural explanation for the apparent phantom behavior ($w<-1$) reported by DESI and DES based on a physical model. Regardless of the SN dataset, there is a preference for non-zero values of $c'$ and $c$ that are in the expected $O(1)$ range in Planck units as suggested by the Swampland criteria. In particular, there is a remarkable consistency with $c'\simeq 0.05 \pm 0.01$ for all dataset combinations including SN, and close to the experimental upper bound of $c'\lesssim 0.2$ demanded by the lack of detection of fifth force in the dark sector.
#### The Rise of Ionized Gas Filaments in Early-Type Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Multiphase filamentary nebulae are ubiquitous in the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) of cool-core clusters, providing key insights into the cycle of baryons and the feeding and feedback of supermassive black holes. However, BCGs account for less than 1% of all early-type galaxies (ETGs). To broaden our understanding of how multiphase filamentary nebulae form in ETGs and connect to the greater picture of galaxy evolution, it is crucial to explore ETGs that are outside of the dense centers of galaxy clusters or groups. We present VLT-MUSE IFU observations of 126 nearby non-central ETGs, detecting warm ionized gas in 54 of them. 35 out of 54 display rotating disks that are morphologically and kinematically aligned with their stellar components, suggesting stellar mass loss as the origin of their warm gas. The remaining 19 host filamentary nebulae that are decoupled from the stellar components, resembling those observed in BCGs. These filamentary sources display unique emission line properties that cannot be fully explained by photoionization from post-asymptotic giant branch stars, active galactic nuclei, or fast gas shocks. For the eight filamentary sources that have been observed with Chandra, their soft X-ray emission indicates the presence of hot gas. We posit that their emission lines may be powered by EUV and X-ray radiation from the cooling of the hot gas, similar to cool-core clusters, but the detailed mechanisms and physical conditions may be different. As a detailed study case, we investigate NGC 4374, a non-central ETG with extensive Chandra observations, and find that its warm filaments are over pressured compared to the hot filaments - opposite with what is observed in cool-core clusters.
#### Little Red Dots from Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the possibility that the recently identified population of high-redshift, obscured quasars - known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) - originates from early black hole seed formation driven by ultra-strongly self-interacting dark matter (uSIDM). In this framework, dark matter halos undergo gravothermal core collapse due to large self-interaction cross sections, resulting in the rapid formation of massive black hole (BH) seeds with masses $\gtrsim 10^{5} M_\odot$ at redshifts $z \gtrsim 5$. We develop a semi-analytic model that tracks the evolution of the dark matter halo population, the redshift of collapse $z_{\rm coll}$, and the corresponding BH mass function. Black hole growth is modeled stochastically via a log-normal Eddington ratio distribution and a finite duty cycle. We find that the uSIDM scenario naturally reproduces key observed properties of LRDs, including their abundance, compactness, and characteristic BH masses, while offering a mechanism for early, obscured black hole formation that is difficult to achieve in standard CDM-based models. The predicted SMBH mass function at $z \sim 5$ shows excellent agreement with LRD observational data and SIDM merger-tree simulations, particularly at the high-mass end $(m_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 10^{7} M_\odot)$. These results suggest that LRDs may serve as powerful observational tracers of exotic dark sector physics and that SMBH formation in the early universe could be significantly shaped by non-gravitational dark matter interactions.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, an abundance of information from neutron-star observations, nuclear experiments and theory has transformed our efforts to elucidate the properties of dense matter. However, at high densities relevant to the cores of neutron stars, substantial uncertainty about the dense matter equation of state (EoS) remains. In this work, we present a semiparametric EoS framework aimed at better integrating knowledge across these domains in astrophysical inference. We use a Meta-model at low densities, and Gaussian Process extensions at high densities. Comparisons between our semiparametric framework to fully nonparametric EoS representations show that imposing nuclear theoretical and experimental constraints through the Meta-model up to nuclear saturation density results in constraints on the pressure up to twice nuclear saturation density. We show that our Gaussian Process trained on EoS models with nucleonic, hyperonic, and quark compositions extends the range of EoS explored at high density compared to a piecewise polytropic extension schema, under the requirements of causality of matter and of supporting the existence of heavy pulsars. We find that maximum TOV masses above $3.2 M_{\odot}$ can be supported by causal EoS compatible with nuclear constraints at low densities. We then combine information from existing observations of heavy pulsar masses, gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers, and X-ray pulse profile modeling of millisecond pulsars within a Bayesian inference scheme using our semiparametric EoS prior. With current astrophysical observations, we find a favored pressure at two times nuclear saturation density of $P(2\rho_{\rm nuc}) = 1.98^{+2.13}_{-1.08}\times10^{34}$ dyn/cm$^{2}$, a radius of a $1.4 M_{\odot}$ neutron star value of $R_{1.4} = 11.4^{+0.98}_{-0.60}$\;km, and $M_{\rm max} = 2.31_{-0.23}^{+0.35} M_{\odot}$ at the 90\% credible level.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate redshift measurements are essential for studying the evolution of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and their role in cosmic structure formation. While spectroscopic redshifts provide high precision, they are impractical for the vast number of sources detected in large-scale surveys. Photometric redshifts, derived from broadband fluxes, offer an efficient alternative, particularly when combined with machine learning techniques. In this work, we develop and evaluate a neural network model for predicting the redshifts of QSOs in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Early Data Release spectroscopic catalogue, using photometry from DESI, the Widefield Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Galactic Evolution Explorer (GALEX). We compare the performance of the neural network model against a k-Nearest Neighbours approach, these being the most accurate and least resource-intensive of the methods trialled herein, optimising model parameters and assessing accuracy with standard statistical metrics. Our results show that incorporating ultraviolet photometry from GALEX improves photometric redshift estimates, reducing scatter and catastrophic outliers compared to models trained only on near infrared and optical bands. The neural network achieves a correlation coefficient with spectroscopic redshift of $0.9187$ with normalised median absolute deviation of $0.197$, representing a significant improvement over other methods. Our work combines DESI, WISE and GALEX measurements, providing robust predictions which address the difficulties in predicting photometric redshift of QSOs over a large redshift range.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmologically coupled black holes (CCBHs) are alternative black hole models whose masses evolve as $M \propto a^3$ on cosmological scales. This characteristic suggests that CCBHs could contribute to the accelerated expansion of the Universe. In this paper, I consider a CCBH model in which the cosmological constant is effectively induced, while the baryonic mass is conserved within conventional black holes. This model is motivated by the theoretical framework of Schwarzschild - de Sitter black holes. Assuming that the accelerated cosmic expansion is caused by CCBHs, I perform a cosmological parameter estimation using datasets including Planck 2018 CMB, CMB lensing, BAO, and supernovae. The analysis reveals notable shifts in cosmological parameters, such as $H_0 = 72.24^{+0.34}_{-0.35} \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, compared to the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$. My $H_0$ constraint is consistent with the value $H_0 = 73.04 \pm 1.04 \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ reported by SH0ES within $1 \sigma$. However, the overall fit to the data worsens, with a total $\chi^2 = 2884.12$ for the CCBH model, compared to $\chi^2 = 2836.12$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model. I show that the effect of cosmological coupling is suppressed by a factor of $10^{-16}$ at $\sim$pc scales, rendering it negligible compared to the standard black hole mass in local astrophysical phenomena, although the CCBH model can explain the accelerated expansion.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a comprehensive wide-band ($3-100$keV) spectro-temporal analysis of 13 outbursting BH-XRBs, using data (quasi)simultaneous with radio observations to unravel the complex disc-jet connection. RXTE observations are analyzed for XTEJ1859+226, GX339-4 (2002, 2006, and 2010 outbursts), 4U1543-47, H1743-322 (2003 and 2009 outbursts), XTEJ1550-564, XTEJ1752-223, XTEJ1650-500, SwiftJ1753.5-0127, XTEJ1748-288, and GROJ1655-40. For SwiftJ1727.8-1613 and MAXIJ1535-571, we utilize HXMT data, while both AstroSat and HXMT observations are analyzed for SwiftJ1658.2-4242. Type-C QPOs observed in harder states (LHS, HIMS; $F_{nth}\ge0.4$) exhibit positive lag for low-inclination sources ($i<50^{\circ}$), whereas it generally exhibits negative lag for high-inclination sources ($i>60^{\circ}$), except XTEJ1550-564, SwiftJ1727.8-1613, H1743-322 (2003 outburst) and GROJ1655-40. Notably, type-A QPOs exhibit negative lags ($\sim1-10$ms) regardless of source inclination, while type-B QPOs show positive lags in low-inclination sources, and both positive and negative lags ($\sim1-15$ms) in high-inclination sources, typically occurring in SIMS ($F_{nth}\lesssim0.45$). Systematic appearance of type-A QPOs preceding radio flares in several sources suggests that type-A QPOs indicate telltale signs of jet ejection, while type-B QPOs are closely linked with radio flares (i.e., transient jets). Present findings suggest the corona evolves from a radially extended to a vertically elongated structure during the type-C to type-B transition via type-A QPOs, with type-B QPOs linked to radially compact or vertically extended coronal geometries, resembling jet ejection. The strong radio-X-ray luminosity correlation seems to provide compelling evidence of accretion-powered jets. Finally, we find that jets in SIMS are moderately relativistic in nature with velocities $\gtrsim 0.3-0.8c$ in BH-XRBs under consideration.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether the latest combination of DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (Planck 2018 + ACT), and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) compilations (Pantheon+, Union3, and DES Y5) favor a dynamical dark energy component, and explore if such a scenario can simultaneously help resolve the Hubble tension. We contrast two frameworks: the widely used phenomenological $w_0 w_a$CDM model, and bimetric gravity, a fundamental modification of general relativity that naturally gives rise to phantom dark energy. The $w_0 w_a$CDM model is moderately preferred over $\Lambda$CDM, at the $2$-$4 \, \sigma$ level, when fitting DESI DR2 + CMB + SNe Ia, but it exacerbates the Hubble tension. By comparison, bimetric gravity provides a modest improvement in fit quality, at the $1 \, \sigma$ level, but, by inferring $H_0 = 69.0 \pm 0.4 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, it partially eases the Hubble tension, from a $5 \,\sigma$ discrepancy to a $3.7 \, \sigma$ tension. Including locally calibrated SNe Ia brings the overall preference for the bimetric model over $\Lambda$CDM to the $2 \, \sigma$ level, comparable to that of the $w_0 w_a$CDM model when including the local SN Ia calibration.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the results of our long-term multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) study on the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 279 during the $\sim14$ years (2008--2022) of {\sl Fermi}-LAT (Large Area Telescope) observing period. The {\sl Fermi}-LAT data were complemented with data in other wavebands obtained from {\sl Swift}-XRT/UVOT, Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT), along with other optical and radio data from several observatories. Different activity states were identified from the weekly binned $\gamma$-ray light curve, and it was possible to create 168 high-quality and quasi-simultaneous broadband SEDs. We modeled the SEDs using a one-zone leptonic scenario, including the emission region outside the broad-line region (BLR), involving synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton, and external Compton mechanisms. Such extensive broadband modeling is essential for constraining the underlying multiwavelength radiative mechanisms in the 3C 279 jet and permits to estimate the physical parameters and explore their evolution in time. Our SED modeling study suggests that the increase in the Doppler beaming factor along with the variation of the emitting electrons is the cause for the flares in this source. The multiwavelength emission of 3C 279 was found to be well explained by the scenario in which the emission region is outside the BLR at a distance of $\sim6.42\times10^{3} R_S$. However, for two of the very bright $\gamma$-ray states, the emission region was found to be close to the outer boundary of the BLR at a distance of $\sim1.28\times10^{3} R_S$ from the central black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic search for spatial association between a high-confidence sample of 3,166 morphologically selected galaxy mergers detected through SDSS imaging and the 4FGL-DR4 catalog of gamma-ray sources detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Using a conservative 4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold and a Poisson-based statistical framework, we identify 21 statistically significant associations with match probabilities $p < 0.05$. Among these are known classes of gamma-ray emitters such as flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacertae objects (BLL), and radio galaxies bolstering the hypothesis that merger-driven processes can fuel high-energy activity. Intriguingly, five of the associated sources remain unclassified in 4FGL-DR4, hinting at a possible link between galaxy mergers and a hitherto unrecognized population of gamma-ray sources. The dominance of AGN-like matches supports the scenario in which mergers trigger accretion onto central supermassive black holes, initiating AGN activity observable at gamma-ray energies. Moreover, the recurrent presence of unassociated sources among secure matches underscores the potential of merger catalogs as physically motivated priors in gamma-ray source identification efforts. This work constitutes the first dedicated effort to explore associations between gamma-ray sources and a large, morphologically selected sample of galaxy mergers, opening new avenues for understanding the role of interactions in high-energy astrophysics. We additionally examined the sample of 70 galaxy pairs from the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and found no statistically significant matches, with $p < 0.05$ within the 4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold.
#### A systematic study of binary neutron star merger rate density history using simulated gravitational wave and short gamma-ray burst observations

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the merger rate density history of binary neutron stars (BNS) can greatly aid in understanding the history of heavy element formation in the Universe. Currently, second-generation Gravitational Wave (GW) detectors can only measure the BNS merger rate density history at low redshifts ($z$ $\sim$ 0.1). Short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) may trace the BNS merger to higher redshifts ($z$ $\sim$ 3). However, not all BNS mergers result in sGRBs, and it is not certain that all sGRBs originate from BNS mergers. In this study, we simultaneously utilize simulated BNS merger GW signals detected by the advanced LIGO design and sGRB signals detected by {\it Fermi}/GBM to constrain the BNS merger rate density history up to $z$ $\sim$ 3. The results indicate that with $\sim$ 8 GWs and 571 sGRBs, the BNS merger rate density can be measured with an accuracy of about 50\% through $z=0$ to $z=1$. The ratio of the jet opening angle-corrected sGRB event rate density to the BNS merger rate density, denoted as $\eta$, can be constrained to a relative uncertainty of 45\%. With $\sim$ 21 GWs and 761 sGRBs, the BNS merger rate density can be measured to approximately 35\% and 40\% at $z=0$ and $z=1$, respectively. Meanwhile, $\eta$ can be constrained to a relative uncertainty of 28\%. Additionally, in our parameterized simulation, we find that at least approximately $\sim$550 sGRBs are needed to constrain the characteristic delay time in the star formation rate model, given a relative error of 50\% in the estimated redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 The Nuclear Stellar Disk (NSD), together with the Nuclear Stellar Cluster and the supermassive black hole Sgr A*, forms the central region of the Milky Way. Galactic X-ray background emission is known to be associated with the old stellar population, predominantly produced by accreting white dwarfs. In this work we characterize the X-ray emission of the Galactic Center (GC) region using wide-field observations with the ART-XC telescope on board the SRG observatory in the 4-12 keV energy band. Our analysis demonstrates that the X-ray emission of the GC at a spatial scale of a few hundred parsecs is dominated by the regularly shaped NSD aligned in the Galactic plane, and characterized by latitudinal and longitudinal scale heights of approximately 20 pc and approximately 100 pc, respectively. The measured flux, 6.8 (+0.1, -0.3) x 10^-10 erg/s/cm^2 in the 4-12 keV band, corresponds to a luminosity of 5.9 (+0.1, -0.3) x 10^36 erg/s, assuming the GC distance of 8.178 kpc. The average mass-normalized X-ray emissivity of the NSD, 5.6 (+0.5, -0.7) x 10^27 erg/s/M_sun, exceeds the corresponding value of the Galactic ridge by a factor of 3.3 (+0.4, -0.5), confirming other studies. We also perform a deprojection of the observed NSD surface brightness distribution in order to construct a three-dimensional X-ray luminosity density model, which can be directly compared to the existing three-dimensional stellar mass models. The emissivity of the NSD as a function of distance to Sgr A* reveals a centrally concentrated maximum, indicating an enhanced radiative output per unit stellar mass in the inner NSD region. Finally, we conclude that the observed spatial properties of the NSD are fully consistent with the stellar mass density distribution, leaving only a small room for a possible diffuse component.

 - **Abstract**
 The next generation of cosmology surveys will probe the matter distribution of the universe to unparalleled precision. To match this level of precision in cosmological parameter estimation, we need to use information at small scales of $\sim$ 1 Mpc, which requires an accurate model of baryonic feedback. In this paper, we employ the Dark Matter + Baryon (DMB) model, a flexible halo model that is well-fit to various hydrodynamical simulations, to extract information on baryonic feedback from galaxy cluster observables. Using a sample of thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) selected galaxy clusters from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) - with masses calibrated via weak lensing from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) - we develop a robust end-to-end pipeline that directly models the calibrated observables. Our analysis demonstrates that the tSZ Y-M relation can constrain several DMB model parameters, providing key insights into baryonic feedback effects on cosmic shear at the several percent level. We find a preference for intermediate to strong levels of feedback, which is both consistent with several hydrodynamic simulations and competitive with similar analyses performed on complementary probes. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of current and upcoming cosmic shear surveys.
#### Delensing CMB B-modes using galaxy surveys: the effect of galaxy bias and matter clustering non-linearities

 - **Abstract**
 The B-mode of polarization of the CMB is a uniquely powerful probe of gravitational waves produced in the very early Universe. But searches for primordial B-mode anisotropies must contend with gravitational lensing, which induces late-time B-modes not associated with gravitational waves. These lensing B-modes can be removed -- i.e., delensed -- using observations of the E-modes and a proxy of the matter fluctuations along the line of sight that caused the deflections. The number density and redshift reach of galaxy surveys such as the upcoming Rubin observatory offer attractive prospects for using them to delens B-mode data from CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory, LiteBIRD or CMB-S4. However, stochasticity and non-linear galaxy bias may in principle decorrelate the galaxy field from the matter distribution responsible for the lensing effect, thus hindering efforts to delens B-modes. In addition, non-linear gravitational evolution and bias introduce non-Gaussianities in the large-scale structure which further complicate the modelling. We quantify these effects by populating an N-body simulation with a magnitude-limited, photometric sample of galaxies similar to Rubin's gold selection, and using them to delens CMB maps lensed by the same matter distribution. We find that pipelines that treat the galaxy overdensity as a Gaussian field will incur negligible bias on the inferred tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. Moreover, we show that even in a highly conservative scenario where only the linear bias of the galaxies can be determined, the bias on r arising from this simplification is well within statistical uncertainties for a cosmic-variance limited scenario where Rubin-like galaxies are used for delensing.

 - **Abstract**
 The corona is an integral component of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) which can produce the X-ray emission. However, many of its physical properties and the mechanisms powering this emission remain a mystery. In this work, we study the coronal X-ray variabilities of 13 AGNs by Gaussian Process. 2-10 keV light curves of 13 AGNs can be successfully described by the damped-random walk (DRW) model. The extracted coronal X-ray timescales range from 3 to 50 days. In the plot of variability timescale versus black hole mass, the coronal X-ray timescales of four sources occupy almost the same region as the optical timescales of the accretion disk, with the latter matching the predicted thermal instability timescale of the disk. In contrast, the X-ray timescales of the remaining sources exhibit a systematic offset toward lower values. We propose that the coronal X-ray variability may be driven by internal processes within the corona itself (such as thermal conduction). On the other hand, it may also be triggered by local thermal instabilities occurring in different regions (close to the central black hole) of the accretion disk, which propagate to the corona via disk-corona coupling.

 - **Abstract**
 We evaluate global asymmetry in the luminosities of neutrinos emitted from rapidly-rotating proto-neutron stars (PNS's). We build axisymmetric models of PNS's in mechanical equilibrium with rotation by adding prescribed angular momentum distributions by hand to non-rotational PNS models, which are extracted from a one-dimensional (spherically symmetric) PNS cooling calculation at different times: \(t=2, 6, 10, 20, 30\)s after a supernova explosion. We then conduct two-dimensional (spatially axisymmetric) neutrino transport calculations on top of them with the matter profiles (and the spacetime geometry) fixed. We find for the rapidly-rotating models with \(T/|W|\sim 5\times 10^{-2}\) that the neutrino luminosity changes by \(\sim 3 \% \) depending on the observer position. We give detailed analyses of the neutrino-hemispheres as well as the neutrino luminosities that are defined observer-wise. We also calculate the low-frequency (\(\lesssim 1{\rm Hz}\)) gravitational waves produced by the neutrinos radiated asymmetrically. We find that those gravitational waves, if emitted from the Galactic center, can be detected by planned detectors such as B-DECIGO, DECIGO and AILA. Finally, we look for crossings in the energy-integrated angular distributions in momentum space for the electron neutrino sector, a signature of the fast flavor conversion. We find them near the PNS surface in all models.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of CHIME J1634+44, a Long Period Radio Transient (LPT) unique for two aspects: it is the first known LPT to emit fully circularly polarized radio bursts, and it is the first LPT with a significant spin-up. Given that high circular polarization ($>90$\%) has been observed in FRB~20201124A and in some giant pulses of PSR~B1937+21, we discuss the implications of the high circular polarization of CHIME J1634+44 and conclude its emission mechanism is likely to be ``pulsar-like''. While CHIME J1634+44 has a pulse period of 841 s, its burst arrival patterns are indicative of a secondary 4206 s period, probably associated with binary activity. The timing properties suggest it has a significantly negative period derivative of $\dot{P}=-9.03(0.11)$ s s$^{-1}$. Few systems have been known to spin-up, most notably transitional millisecond pulsars and cataclysmic binaries, both of which seem unlikely progenitors for CHIME J1634+44. If the period was only associated with the spin of the object, then the spin up is likely generated by accretion of material from a companion. If, however, the radio pulse period and the orbital period are locked, as appears to be the case for two other LPTs, the spin up of CHIME J1634+44 could be driven by gravitational wave radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galaxy mergers with separations $<$ 1kpc are crucial to our understanding of SMBH growth, galaxy evolution, and the evolution of SMBH binaries. Despite their importance, there are less than a handful known, and most have been discovered serendipitously. In this work, we employ a new selection method to systematically pre-select candidate advanced mergers likely to contain unresolved substructure at sub-arcsecond scales. By exploiting the large survey area and astrometric precision of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we have identified a sample of 48 nearby advanced mergers that have red WISE colors ($W_1-W_2>0.5$) indicative of accretion activity and significant sub-arcsecond offsets between their optical and infrared coordinates as measured by SDSS and WISE. We conducted high resolution adaptive optics (AO) observations of this sample with the Keck NIRC2 camera in the $K_p$ band ($2.124 ~ \mu m$, $\Delta\lambda = 0.351 \mu m$) to search for evidence of previously unresolved substructure suggested by the optical-to-infared offsets. We find that a significant fraction (20/48 or 42%) of the sample shows substructure tracing the SDSS/WISE offset and unresolved by SDSS, demonstrating that our methodology is a promising pathway to find dual AGN in follow-up spectroscopy. Archival optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging reveals that substructure identified with Keck is often missed in the optical or erroneously identified due to partial obscuration, underscoring the importance of carrying out studies of late-stage mergers in the infrared.

 - **Abstract**
 It has recently been revealed that charged scalar clouds, spatially regular matter configurations which are made of linearized charged massive scalar fields, can be supported by spinning and charged Kerr-Newman black holes. Using analytical techniques, we establish a no-short hair theorem for these stationary bound-state field configurations. In particular, we prove that the effective proper lengths of the supported charged massive scalar clouds are bounded from below by the remarkably compact dimensionless relation $\ell/M>\ln(3+\sqrt{8})$, where $M$ is the mass of the central supporting black hole. Intriguingly, this lower bound is universal in the sense that it is valid for all Kerr-Newman black-hole spacetimes [that is, in the entire regime $\{a/M\in(0,1],Q/M\in[0,1)\}$ of the dimensionless spin and charge parameters that characterize the central supporting black holes] and for all values of the physical parameters (electric charge $q$, proper mass $\mu$, and angular harmonic indexes $\{l,m\}$) that characterize the supported stationary bound-state scalar fields.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of future trapping horizons through the dynamics of the Misner-Sharp mass using ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. Our analysis shows that an integral formulation of Hayward's first law governs much of the evolution of general spherically symmetric spacetimes. To account for the accretion backreaction, we consider a near-horizon approximation, yielding first-order corrections of a Vaidya-dark energy form. We further propose a systematic perturbative scheme to study these effects for an arbitrary background. As an application, we analyze an accreting Reissner-Nordström black hole and demonstrate the horizon shifts that are produced. Finally, we compute accretion-induced corrections to an extremal configuration. It is shown that momentum influx and energy density produce distinct effects: the former forces the splitting of the extremal horizon, while the latter induces significant displacements in its position, computed up to first-order perturbative corrections. These results highlight how different components of the stress-energy tensor significantly affect horizon geometry, with potential implications for broader areas of research, including black-hole thermodynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 The anisotropies induced by Lorentz-violating fields pose significant challenges for the search for compact objects in non-vacuum environments. In this work, we demonstrate that introducing couplings between Lorentz-violating fields and matter facilitates the formation of traversable wormholes. Specifically, we introduce additional couplings in the Lagrangian of a phantom scalar field and derive Ellis-Bronnikov spacetime analogs in three distinct Lorentz-violating scenarios: (I) modifications arising from the vacuum expectation value of the bumblebee field, (II) contributions from the vacuum expectation value of an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor field, and (III) a combined scenario incorporating both fields. In the latter case, despite the distinct nature of the fields, their non-zero vacuum expectation values contribute additively to the overall effect on the phantom distribution and on the resulting line element. Moreover, we consider scalar waves to probe the effects of the Lorentz violation in these spacetimes. Notably, the additional Lorentz-violating couplings can alter scalar field dynamics such that perturbations propagate as if in a General Relativity background, which allows for some traits of Lorentz violation to be hidden. We compute the quasinormal mode spectra of these perturbations using three methods: direct integration, 6th-order WKB approximation, and the Prony method, finding strong agreement among the results.

 Recently the modified teleparallel gravity models attracted a lot of interests. In this paper we consider more extensions to the New General Relativity (NGR) model with parity violations. This extended NGR model differs from the normal NGR model by the inclusion of additional parity-odd term that is quadratic in the torsion tensor. By investigating its cosmological perturbations of this model, we find that this model can avoid ghost instabilities in certain regions of the parameter space, where the coefficient of the parity-odd term does not vanish.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) offer a promising avenue to test extra-dimensional physics through gravitational wave (GW) observations. In this work, we study equatorial eccentric EMRIs around a spherically symmetric braneworld black hole, focusing on the influence of a tidal charge parameter arising as extra dimensions. Using the fact of tr-symmetry of the spacetime under consideration, we implement the Modified Teukolsky Equation (MTE) framework and compute observables, as well as compare the results with those from the standard Teukolsky formalism for general relativity (GR). Our analysis reveals significant deviations in dephasing and mismatch values, especially for the higher eccentricities. These findings highlight not only the observational potential of future low-frequency detectors like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) but also the necessity of using the MTE framework for accurately modeling binaries in theories beyond GR.
#### Scattering of a point mass by a Schwarzschild black hole: radiated energy and angular momentum

 - **Abstract**
 The radiated energy and angular momentum from a point mass on a hyperbolic-like orbit about a Schwarzschild black hole are computed for the first time in the framework of the first-order self-force theory. The analytical expressions for the fluxes are obtained through the standard method of Mano, Suzuki and Takasugi in the form of combined post-Minkowskian (PM) and post-Newtonian (PN) expansions. The reached PM accuracy for the energy and angular momentum losses is $O(G^5)$ and $O(G^4)$, respectively, and 7PN for both. The radiative losses (energy, angular momentum and linear momentum) are currently known in PN-expanded form up to the (fractional) 3PN order [D. Bini et al., Phys. Rev. D \textbf{107}, 024012 (2023)]. Exact PM results valid for arbitrary values of the velocity are limited to $O(G^4)$ for the energy and $O(G^3)$ for the angular momentum. An exact expression for the radiated energy at $O(G^5)$ has been recently obtained in [M. Driesse et al., Nature \textbf{641}, 603-607 (2025)] in the first-order self force limit, whereas the $O(G^4)$ radiated angular momentum has been partially determined in [C. Heissenberg, Phys. Rev. D \textbf{111}, 126012 (2025)]. The results of this work are in agreement with the state of the art of both energy and angular momentum losses, also completing the knowledge of the 4PM radiated angular momentum up to the reached PN accuracy. The expressions for radiative losses are then used to get the 5PM radiation-reacted scattering angle, which should also serve as a cross-check of ongoing calculations by other methods.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the dynamics and relativistic precessions of massive particles on spherical orbits around Kerr-MOG black holes in scalar-tensor-vector gravity (STVG). By employing the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, we derive conserved quantities and analyze how the MOG parameter $\alpha$ and orbital tilt angle $\zeta$ influence the innermost stable spherical orbits (ISSOs) and orbital stability. We compute the nodal and periastron precession frequencies, finding that nodal precession increases monotonically with both black hole spin and MOG parameter, while periastron precession exhibits a more complex behavior: MOG amplifies curvature-induced effects, which can be partially counteracted by spin. Furthermore, to complement the orbital analysis, we examine the Lense-Thirring spin precession of a gyroscope and demonstrate its sensitivity to the MOG parameter, spin, and orbital tilt angle. These results reveal distinctive signatures of modified gravity in orbital dynamics and provide a potential observational probe to test deviations from general relativity near rotating black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the energetics and thermodynamics of spacetimes with no horizons, but endowed with a preferred timelike junction surface. They could arise as a limiting case of the gravastar and other constructions regularizing the interior of the horizon of a black hole, or from the conceptual cutting of a portion of a non-asymptotically flat space and gluing it with flat space. We find that such surfaces can be made to have zero energy, so that the energetics of such spaces is not encumbered by them. They do have a transverse pressure, fixed by the jump in surface gravity. A peculiar matter thermodynamics then follows, with well defined entropy, temperature and surface pressure, constrained by specific relations arising from the zero energy condition. This is confirmed by the Euclidean path integral, with the proviso that the Tolman-Ehrenfest temperature should be used. The entropy of the space is then the area of the timelike surface in units of a fundamental area, and the matter temperature is proportional to the transverse pressure and so the jump in surface gravity. However, when the gravitational action is added, the free energy of the surface is also zero. The fact that for some such spaces the temperature comes out negative raises interesting questions regarding the third law of thermodynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultralight bosonic fields around a rotating black hole can extract energy and angular momentum through the superradiant instability and form a dense cloud. We investigate the scenario involving two scalar fields, $\phi$ and $\chi$, with a coupling term $\frac{1}{2}\lambda\phi\chi^2$, which is motivated by the multiple-axion framework. The ultralight scalar $\phi$ forms a cloud that efficiently produces $\chi$ particles non-perturbatively via parametric resonance, with a large mass hierarchy, $\mu_\chi \gg \mu_\phi$. Rather than escaping the system as investigated by previous studies, these $\chi$ particles remain bound, orbiting the black hole. Moreover, the particle production occurs primarily at the peak of the cloud's profile, allowing $\chi$ particles in quasi-circular orbits to pass repeatedly through resonant regions, leading to sustained amplification. This selective process naturally forms a dense ring of $\chi$ particles, with a mass ratio to the cloud fixed by $(\mu_\phi/\mu_\chi)^2$. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for generating bound-state particles via parametric resonance, which also impacts the evolution of the cloud. This process can be probed through its imprint on binary dynamics and its gravitational-wave signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the thermodynamical properties of accelerated charged Anti-de Sitter black holes in the context of rainbow gravity. Concretely, we compute the corresponding quantities needed to study the thermal stability and the critical behaviors including the phase transitions. Linking the acceleration parameter $A$ and the horizon radius $r_h$ via a constant parameter $a$, we discuss the $P$-$v$ criticality behaviors by calculating the critical pressure $P_c$, the critical temperature $T_c$ and the critical specific volume $v_c$ in terms of $a$ and the rainbow gravity parameter $\varepsilon$. As results, we reveal that the ratio $ \dfrac{P_{c}v_{c}}{T_{c}}$ is an universal number with respect to the charge. In small limits of the external parameters, we recover the Van der Waals fluid behaviors.

 - **Abstract**
 A common feature of regular black hole spacetimes is the presence of an inner Cauchy horizon. The analogy to the Reissner-Nordström solution then suggests that these geometries suffer from a mass-inflation effect, rendering the Cauchy horizon unstable. Recently, it was shown that this analogy fails for certain classes of regular black holes, including the Hayward solution, where the late-time behavior of the mass function no longer grows exponentially but follows a power law. In this work, we extend these results in a two-fold way. First, we determine the basin-of-attraction for the power-law attractor, showing that the tamed growth of the mass function is generic. Second, we extend the systematic analysis to the Bardeen geometry, the Dymnikova black hole, and a spacetime arising from a non-singular collapse model newly proposed in the context of asymptotically safe quantum gravity. Remarkably, in the latter solution, the Misner-Sharp mass at the Cauchy horizon remains of the same order of magnitude of the mass of the black hole, since its growth is just logarithmic.

 The Dymnikova black hole (BH) is a regular solution that interpolates between a de Sitter core near the origin and a Schwarzschild-like behavior at large distances. In this work, we investigate the properties of a Dymnikova BH immersed in a quintessential field, characterized by the state parameter $\omega$ and a normalization constant $c$. We explore the thermodynamic behavior, null geodesics, scalar quasinormal modes and shadow profiles for this model. Our analysis shows that the presence of quintessence alters the Hawking temperature and specific heat, leading to parameter-dependent phase transitions. The null geodesics and corresponding black hole shadows are also found to be sensitive to the model parameters, especially $\omega$ and $c$. This sensitivity influences light deflection and shadow size. Furthermore, we compute the scalar quasinormal modes and observe that quintessence tends to enhance the damping of the modes, indicating greater stability under perturbations.

 - **Abstract**
 Thermodynamic systems admit multiple equivalent descriptions related by transformations that preserve their fundamental structure. This work focuses on exact isohomogeneous transformations (EITs), a class of mappings that keep fixed the set of independent variables of the thermodynamic potential, while preserving both the original homogeneity and the validity of a first law. Our investigation explores EITs within the extended Iyer--Wald formalism for theories containing free parameters (e.g., the cosmological constant). EITs provide a unifying framework for reconciling the diverse formulations of Kerr-anti de Sitter (KadS) thermodynamics found in the literature. While the Iyer--Wald formalism is a powerful tool for deriving first laws for black holes, it typically yields a non-integrable mass variation that prevents its identification as a proper thermodynamic potential. To address this issue, we investigate an extended Iyer--Wald formalism where mass and thermodynamic volume become gauge dependent. Within this framework, we identify the gauge choices and Killing vector normalizations that are compatible with EITs, ensuring consistent first laws. As a key application, we demonstrate how conventional KadS thermodynamics emerges as a special case of our generalized approach.

 - **Abstract**
 In the early 1970s, Jacob Bekenstein proposed that black holes possess an entropy proportional to the area of their event horizon, introducing the Generalized Second Law of thermodynamics. Stephen Hawking initially objected to this idea, but his subsequent analysis of quantum field theory in curved spacetime led to the prediction of Hawking radiation and the concept of black hole temperature. This study offers a concise overview of the development of black hole thermodynamics between 1972 and 1975, highlighting the theoretical evolution of both Bekenstein's and Hawking's contributions. The work also reflects on the lasting impact of these developments on modern theoretical physics and quantum gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a generalized power-law dark energy equation of state of the form \( p = w\rho - \beta\rho^m \) in a flat FLRW universe, analyzing its dynamical stability and thermodynamic consistency. The model exhibits a rich phase space structure, with an effective cosmological constant \(\rho^* = [(1+w)/\beta]^{1/(m-1)}\) emerging as a stable attractor for \((w < -1,~ m > 1)\). Notably, the universe evolves from an early de Sitter phase (\(w \to -1\)) to a late-time de Sitter-like one with phantom crossing (\(w(z) < -1\)), aligning with DESI observations. Dynamical analysis reveals that the \(m > 1\) regime avoids ghost instabilities while accommodating phantom behavior, with \(m = 2\) providing particular theoretical advantages. Thermodynamically, the Generalized Second Law holds when the null energy condition \(\rho + p \geq 0\) is satisfied, which naturally occurs for \(\rho \geq \rho^*\). The model's compatibility with both observational data and fundamental thermodynamic principles suggests it as a viable framework for describing late-time cosmic acceleration, resolving tensions associated with phantom crossing while maintaining entropy dominance of the cosmological horizon.

 - **Abstract**
 We have investigated the bright ring-like features and polarization structures in the Kerr-Sen black hole's images based on general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) simulations, which are illuminated by the 230 GHz thermal synchrotron emission from the radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAF). Using the REx method, we extracted the bright ring from the black hole images and found that both the bright ring and black hole shadow shrink as the dilation parameter increases. Combing with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data of SgrA*, we present the allowed ranges of black hole parameters for different observed inclinations and disk thicknesses. Our results show that effects of the disk thickness on the allowed parameter space are more strong than those of the observed inclination. We also probe the rotational symmetry of EVPA in the polarization structure of the black hole images by analyzing the coefficient $\beta_2$. The dilaton parameter results in that the real part $Re\beta_2$ increases and the imaginary part $Im\beta_2$ decreases, but the magnitude $|\beta_2|$ generally exhibits a declining trend. Finally, we find that effects of the disk thickness on $\beta_2$ are much weaker than those from the dilaton parameter.

 This study discusses the development of some particular static wormhole models in the background of an extended $f(Q)$ gravity theory. Wormhole solutions are derived by considering the radial pressure to admit an equation of state corresponding to Chaplygin gas. The Chaplygin gas equation of state is taken into consideration in two different forms: $p_{r}=-\frac{Bb(r)^{u}}{\rho^{a}}$, $p_{r}=-\frac{B}{\rho^{a}}$. Wormhole models are also generated assuming that a variable barotropic fluid may explain the radial pressure given by $p_{r} =-\omega\rho b(r)^u$. For every model, the shape function $b(r)$ is the function that can be derived from the wormhole metric in any scenario. The stability analysis of the wormhole solutions and the shape function viability for each situation are then this http URL each wormhole model is shown to violate the null energy condition (NEC), it can be understood that these wormholes are traversable. More generally, we investigate whether the model is stable under the hydrostatic equilibrium state condition using the TOV this http URL physical characteristics of these models are shown under the same energy circumstances. The typical characteristic is the radial pressure $p_{r}$ near the wormhole throat, which violates the NEC $(\rho+P_{r} \geq0)$. In some models, it is possible to meet the NEC at the neck and yet violate the DEC $(\rho - P_{r}\geq0)$. In summary, precise wormhole models may be generated, provided that $(\rho\geq0)$, and there may be a potential breach of the NEC at the wormhole's throat.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the photon orbits around a Kerr-like black hole in Einstein-Bumblebee gravity, where Lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken. By solving the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, we derive a sixth-order polynomial that governs the photon motion, explicitly dependent on the rotation parameter $u$, the Lorentz violation parameter $\ell$, and the effective inclination angle $v$. We analyze photon orbit configurations in polar, equatorial, and general inclined planes, identifying significant deviations from the Kerr solution. In the polar and equatorial planes, we identify distinct photon orbit configurations and analyze their dependence on model parameters. For general inclined orbits, we find a critical inclination angle $v$ that determines the number and location of photon orbits in both extremal and non-extremal cases. All photon orbits are radially unstable, and the critical impact parameter decreases with increasing Lorentz violation, potentially providing observable signatures to differentiate Einstein-Bumblebee gravity from general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 We conducted a theoretical analysis of the violation of the equivalence principle within a broad class of scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories that exhibit spontaneous scalarization. Beginning with the Jordan frame, we performed a conformal mapping to identify the equivalent model in the Einstein frame. This approach revealed that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling introduces a mixed term that links the Einstein tensor to the kinetic terms, along with an additional kinetic term associated with the box operator, echoing characteristics of Horndeski-like theories. Our findings confirm a violation of the weak equivalence principle, as the geodesic equation incorporates an extra term that, in the non-relativistic limit, leads to a modified Newtonian equation. This result was further corroborated using Eardley's methodology. We also examined the violation of the strong equivalence principle through the Nordtvedt effect within the framework of an extended parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism. We provide a concrete example of scalarized theories featuring extended PPN parameters that deviate from general relativity, comparing these results against observational constraints from the Cassini mission, the MESSENGER mission, and the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment. While the Cassini bounds remain the most stringent, the constraints on the Nordtvedt parameter offer significantly better restrictions on the parameter space than those derived from the precession rate of Mercury's perihelion.

 The introduction of General Relativity (GR) in 1915 revolutionized our understanding of gravity, but over time, its limitations in explaining phenomena like dark energy, dark matter, and quantum gravity have motivated alternative theories. Early modifications, such as Weyl's 1919 proposal, focused on adding higher-order terms to the Einstein-Hilbert action. GR's non-renormalizability further strengthened the case for extending it. A central theme of modern gravity research is modifying the geometric structure, often by changing the gravitational Lagrangian. This leads to theories such as teleparallel and symmetric teleparallel gravity, utilizing torsion or non-Levi-Civita connections, with differential geometry providing the essential framework. This thesis explores several modified gravity models. Chapter 1 introduces necessary mathematical tools. Chapter 2 develops a novel parametrization of the deceleration parameter, constrained using MCMC and observational data, and applies it to f(Q) gravity. Chapter 3 embeds the LambdaCDM model into f(Q, L\_m) gravity with non-minimal coupling, producing analytic solutions and matching observations through cosmographic analysis. Chapter 4 considers Bianchi-I spacetime in f(R, L\_m) gravity with observational constraints to measure anisotropy. Chapter 5 presents wormhole solutions in f(Q, T) gravity with conformal symmetries. Chapter 6 explores wormholes in f(R, L\_m) with non-commutative geometry, analyzing shape functions, energy conditions, and stability. Chapter 7 studies Big Bang Nucleosynthesis in f(T) gravity, constraining hybrid models using early- and late-time data, and validating intermediate epochs via cosmography.

 - **Abstract**
 The merger of binary neutron stars (BNSs) is a remarkable astrophysical event where all four fundamental forces interplay dynamically across multiple stages, producing a rich spectrum of multi-messenger signals. These observations present a significant multiphysics modeling challenge but also offer a unique opportunity to probe the nature of gravity and the strong nuclear interaction under extreme conditions. The landmark detection of GW170817 provided essential constraints on the properties of non-rotating neutron stars (NSs), including their maximum mass (M_{max}) and radius distribution, thereby informing the equation of state (EOS) of cold, dense nuclear matter. While the inspiral phase of such events has been extensively studied, the post-merger signal holds even greater potential to reveal the behavior of matter at supranuclear densities, particularly in scenarios involving a transition to deconfined quark matter. Motivated by the recent gravitational wave event GW190814 (2.5-2.67 M_{\odot}), we revisit the modeling of high-mass compact stars to investigate their internal structure via a generalized polytropic EOS. This framework incorporates a modified energy density profile and is coupled with the TOV equations. We explore mass-radius (M-R) relationships within both GR and the minimal geometric deformation (MGD) approach. Specifically, we constrain the radii of four massive compact objects PSR J1614-2230 (1.97^{+0.04}_{-0.04}\,M_{\odot}), PSR J0952-0607 (2.35^{+0.17}_{-0.17}\,M_\odot), GW190814 (2.5-2.67\,M_\odot), and GW200210 (2.83^{+0.47}_{-0.42}\,M_\odot) and demonstrate that our theoretical M-R curves are consistent with observational data. These findings provide meaningful constraints on the EOS and underscore the potential of alternative gravity models to accommodate ultra-massive compact stars within a physically consistent framework.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of cosmic structures within the framework of modified gravity, specifically focusing on theories described by the function $f(R, L_m)$, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $L_m$ is the matter Lagrangian. This class of models introduces a non-minimal coupling between geometry and matter, leading to modifications in the dynamics of density perturbations. We derive the linear growth equation and compute the observable growth rate $f\sigma_8(z)$, which is directly accessible from redshift-space distortion (RSD) data. Using recent observational constraints from galaxy surveys such as eBOSS and DESI, we perform a comparative analysis between predictions from $f(R, L_m)$ gravity and the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our results indicate that while $\Lambda$CDM remains broadly consistent with current data, the $f(R, L_m)$ framework can accommodate subtle deviations in structure growth, offering a possible resolution to existing tensions in large-scale structure observations. We also outline the implications of our findings for future surveys, including Euclid and LSST.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04083

 - **Abstract**
 Independently from the formation mechanism of primordial black holes in the early universe, their generation is accompanied by a ringdown phase during which they relax to a stationary configuration and gravitational waves under the form of quasinormal modes are emitted. Such gravitational waves generate an irreducible and unavoidable stochastic background which is testable by current and future experiments. In particular, the presence of a primordial black hole ringdown allows to significantly constrain the idea of extremely supermassive black holes to comprise the entire dark matter of the universe.

Overall, we find that deviations from the Kerr metric grow with spin.
#### Optimal Detection Bands for Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Binaries: Prospects for LISA and AMIGO in General Relativity and $f(R, T)$ Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We present a semi analytic forecast for the detection of intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) binaries with the space based detectors LISA (millihertz band) and AMIGO (deci hertz band). A redshift dependent population model is built from extrapolated black hole mass functions and realistic pairing and merger time scales. Folding this population through the instrument sensitivities yields event rates of about 1e4 mergers for LISA in four observing years and between 1e2 and 1e3 mergers for AMIGO in three years, with complementary optimal detection bands in total mass and redshift. We then incorporate the minimal matter coupled modified gravity model f(R,T) = R + 2 lambda T. In this scenario the strain amplitude is rescaled by (1 - lambda / 8 pi)^(5/6) while the waveform phasing is unchanged at leading order. For Solar System compatible couplings abs(lambda) <= 2 x 10^-3, the peak detection redshift shifts by less than one percent and the total number of events changes by less than five percent. Combined statistics from LISA and AMIGO therefore provide a consistency check on f(R,T) gravity without spoiling standard IMBH forecasts.

 - **Abstract**
 Compact binaries with large mass asymmetries - such as Extreme and Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals - are unique probes of the astrophysical environments in which they evolve. Their long-lived and intricate dynamics allow for precise inference of source properties, provided waveform models are accurate enough to capture the full complexity of their orbital evolution. In this work, we develop a multi-parameter formalism, inspired by vacuum perturbation theory, to model asymmetric binaries embedded in general matter distributions with both radial and tangential pressures. In the regime of small deviations from the Schwarzschild metric, relevant to most astrophysical scenarios, the system admits a simplified description, where both metric and fluid perturbations can be cast into wave equations closely related to those of the vacuum case. This framework offers a practical approach to modeling the dynamics and the gravitational wave emission from binaries in realistic matter distributions, and can be modularly integrated with existing results for vacuum sources.
#### Suppressed Intrinsic Curvature Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We consider various mechanisms of modifying the effect of intrinsic curvature in gravity with respect to general relativity. Two primary approaches are studied. First, by considering a Lagrange multiplier or an auxiliary field. Second, by non-minimal coupling between a scalar field and the intrinsic curvature scalar. We reproduce the basic solutions of FLRW cosmology, black hole solutions, Lense-Thirring effect, and gravitational waves. The speed of gravitational waves is modified in comparison to the speed of light. A certain limit of our theory corresponds to the lowest-order Carroll gravity. Hence, our theory is a different UV completion of Carroll gravity, compared to the usual expansion of a small speed of light. Carroll gravity limit also has an enhanced symmetry, making the reduced or vanishing extrinsic curvature technically natural. Although the intrinsic curvature and its modification may depend on the foliation, we use the covariant formalism and show that such a foliation always exists. Perhaps the most important outcome is that in the non-minimal coupling approach, the intrinsic curvature appearing in Einstein's field equations can defer from the one appearing in the geodesic equation potentially leading to important observational consequences.

 - **Abstract**
 The theory controlling the Universe's evolution in the classical regime has to be motivated by particle physics reasoning and should also generate inflation and dark energy eras in a unified way. One such framework is $F(R)$ gravity. In this work we examine a class of exponential deformations of $R^2$ gravity motivated by fundamental physics of scalaron evolution in a de Sitter background. As we show this class of models describe both inflation and the dark energy era in a viable way compatible with the Planck constraints on inflation and the cosmological parameters. Regarding the inflationary era, the exponentially deformed $R^2$ model also yields a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term which remarkably does not affect the dynamics and the inflationary evolution is identical to that of an $R^2$ model. The dark energy era is also found to be viable and mimics the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model. More importantly, this class of $F(R)$ gravity exponential $R^2$ deformations also has an important characteristic, and specifically it yields total equation of state oscillations deeply in the matter domination era, for redshifts $z\sim 3400$, so near the matter-radiation equality. These total equation of state deformations at such a large redshift may directly affect the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves. Indeed as we show, the effect is measurable and it leads to an enhancement of the tensor perturbations energy spectrum for low frequencies probed by the future LiteBIRD mission. This enhancement might have a measurable effect on the $B$-modes of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation and thus may be detectable by the LiteBIRD mission. Only a handful of theoretical frameworks can generate the gravitational wave pattern generated by the class of exponentially deformed $R^2$ models we presented.
#### Geodesic completeness, curvature singularities and infinite tidal forces

 - **Abstract**
 We report some new findings regarding the subtle relations among geodesic completeness, curvature singularities and tidal forces. It is well known that any particle may be torn up near a singularity at the center of a black hole due to the divergent tidal force. However, we find that singularity is not the only cause of tidal force divergence. Even on the surface of the Earth, the tidal force experienced by a particle could be arbitrarily large if the particle moves arbitrarily close to the speed of light in a nonradial direction. Usually, a curvature singularity implies geodesic incompleteness since in many cases the metric cannot be defined at the location of the singularity. Counterexamples have been found in recent years, suggesting that geodesics could pass through curvature singularities. By taking into account the fact that any real particle is an extended body, we calculate the tidal force acting on the particle in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime. We explicitly show that an infinite tidal force always occurs near such a singularity. Therefore, no particle can actually reach the curvature singularity even if the metric is well defined at that point. We also show that the tidal acceleration along a null geodesic at the coordinate origin is divergent. For a wormhole solution that has a curvature singularity at the throat but possesses a regular metric, we show that the tidal force on any particle passing through the throat is divergent.
#### Improved Binary Black Hole Search Discriminator from the Singular Value Decomposition of Non-Gaussian Noise Transients

 - **Abstract**
 The sensitivity of current gravitational wave (GW) detectors to transient GW signals is severely affected by a variety of non-Gaussian and non-stationary noise transients, such as the blip and tomte "glitches". These glitches share some time-frequency resemblance with GW signals from massive binary black holes. In earlier works [Joshi et al., Phys. Rev. D 103, 044035 (2021); Choudhary et al., Phys. Rev. D 110, 044051 (2024)], the authors presented a method for constructing a $\chi^2$-distributed optimized statistic, based on the unified formalism of $\chi^2$ discriminators [Dhurandhar et al., Phys. Rev. D 96, 103018 (2017)], to distinguish the blip and tomte glitches from the compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals. Unlike past works, the new $\chi^2$ discriminator is constructed from the most significant singular vectors obtained from the singular-value decomposition (SVD) of glitches in real detector data. We find that the chi-square developed in this work performs as efficiently as in Choudhary et al. [Phys. Rev. D 110, 044051 (2024)], which used sine-Gaussian basis vectors. This result supports past empirical findings that the blips and tomtes are well-modeled by sine-Gaussians. It also introduces a method for constructing signal- and glitch-based $\chi^2$ discriminators by directly using real data containing the glitches and, thus, holds promise for extensions to glitches that are captured less well by sine-Gaussians or other analytical functions.

 - **Abstract**
 Strong self-gravitational fields enable the realization of macroscopic odd-parity quantum objects. Using ray-tracing methods, we systematically analyze the shadow features of rotating black holes with parity-odd scalar hair and contrast them with those of Kerr black holes. Our results demonstrate measurable distinctions between scalar-haired black hole shadows and their Kerr counterparts. Notably, even for tiny scalar charge and negligible scalar hair mass contributions, these differences remain quantitatively resolvable. These findings provide critical theoretical benchmarks for future observational campaigns targeting scalar-field dark matter candidates through black hole shadow imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamic topology of black holes within the framework of Tsallis statistics. By integrating Tsallis non-extensive statistics with topological thermodynamics, we analyze the local and global stability of various black hole solutions, including Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, and higher-dimensional black holes. The introduction of Tsallis entropy, parameterized by the non-extensive parameter delta, results in distinct thermodynamic behaviors depending on its value. Employing Duan's phi-mapping theory, we classify the thermodynamic topology of four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes and non-charged higher-dimensional black holes into three distinct classes based on their topological number W: stable (W = +1), unstable (W = -1), and critical (W = 0). Additionally, the thermodynamic topology of Reissner-Nordstrom and charged higher-dimensional black holes is categorized into two classes, where W = +1 indicates a stable class and W = 0 represents a less stable class. Our study further demonstrates that the number of dimensions does not affect the topological thermodynamics within the context of non-extensive statistics. This approach provides novel insights into the interplay between Tsallis statistics and black hole thermodynamics, underscoring the pivotal role of topology in understanding black hole physics.

 The LISA mission is an international collaboration between ESA, its member states, and NASA, for the detection of gravitational waves from space. It was adopted in January 2024 and is scheduled for launch in the mid-2030's. It will be a constellation of three identical spacecraft forming a near-equilateral triangle in an heliocentric orbit, transferring laser beams over $2.5 \cdot 10^6$ km long arms. Laser interferometry is used to track separations between test masses, thus measuring spacetime strain variations as a function of time. LISA Science Objectives tackle many open questions in astrophysics, fundamental physics and cosmology, including ESA's Cosmic Vision questions "What are the fundamental laws of the universe?" and "How did the universe originate and of what is it made?". In this contribution, based on the LISA Red Book, we present a summary of the LISA Science Objectives relevant for the European Strategy for Particle Physics.
#### Regular Magnetically Charged Black Holes from Nonlinear Electrodynamics: Thermodynamics, Light Deflection, and Orbital Dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the thermodynamic properties, light deflection, and orbital dynamics of regular magnetically charged black holes (NRCBHs) arising from nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) coupled to general relativity. The metric function $f(r)$ ensures complete regularity at the origin while maintaining asymptotic flatness, with the extremal magnetic charge limit reaching $q_{\text{ext}} \approx 2.54M$, significantly exceeding the Reissner-Nordström value. Using the quantum tunneling framework, we derive the Hawking temperature and incorporate generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) corrections, showing $T_{\text{GUP}} = (f'(r_h)/4\pi)\sqrt{1-2\beta m_p^2}$. The weak deflection of light is analyzed through the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT), revealing charge-dependent behavior where large $q$ values lead to negative deflection angles due to electromagnetic repulsion. Plasma effects further modify the deflection through the refractive index $n(r) = \sqrt{1 - \omega_p^2(r)f(r)/\omega_0^2}$. Keplerian motion analysis demonstrates that the angular velocity $\Omega(r)$ exhibits charge-sensitive maxima related to quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in accretion disks. Finally, we examine Joule-Thomson expansion (JTE) properties, finding that the coefficient $\mu_J$ indicates cooling behavior for higher charges and larger event horizons. Our results provide comprehensive insights into the observational signatures of NRCBHs, with implications for gravitational lensing, X-ray astronomy, and tests of nonlinear electromagnetic theories in strong gravitational fields.

 - **Abstract**
 A new class of exact spacetimes in Einstein's gravity, which are Kerr black holes immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field that is asymptotically uniform and oriented along the rotational axis, is presented. These are axisymmetric stationary solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations such that the null directions of the Faraday tensor are not aligned with neither of the two principal null directions of the Weyl tensor of algebraic type D (unlike the Kerr-Melvin spacetime). Three physical parameters are the black hole mass $m$, its rotation $a$, and the external field value $B$. For vanishing $B$ the metric directly reduces to standard Boyer-Lindquist form of the Kerr black hole, while for zero $m$ we recover conformally flat Bertotti-Robinson universe with a uniform Maxwell field. For zero $a$ the spacetime is contained in the Van den Bergh-Carminati solution which can be understood as the Schwarzschild black hole in a magnetic field. Our family of black holes with non-aligned Maxwell hair - that can be called the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black holes - may find application in various studies ranging from mathematical relativity to relativistic astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 A Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field $\phi$, responsible for the late-time cosmic acceleration and interacting with a coherent scalar field $\psi$ through an interaction potential $W(\phi,\psi)$, is considered from the point of view of particle physics for two different models. The non-minimal coupling between the GB curvature term and the field $\phi$ leads to a time-dependent speed of gravitational waves (GWs), which is fixed to unity in order to be consistent with current GW observations, rendering the GB coupling function model-independent. We investigate the dynamical stability of the system by formulating it in the form of an autonomous system, and constrain the model parameters using various sets of observational data. We find that both models are physically viable and closely follow the $\Lambda$CDM trend. We also use the updated Roman mock high redshift data to further constrain the parameters of the two models.

 - **Abstract**
 Overlapping gravitational wave (GW) signals are expected in the third-generation (3G) GW detectors, leading to one of the major challenges in GW data analysis. Inference of overlapping GW sources is complicated - it has been reported that hierarchical inference with signal subtraction may amplify errors, while joint estimation, though more accurate, is computationally expensive. However, in this work, we show that hierarchical subtraction can achieve accurate results with a sufficient number of iterations, and on the other hand, neural density estimators, being able to generate posterior samples rapidly, make it possible to perform signal subtraction and inference repeatedly. We further develop likelihood-based resampling to accelerate the convergence of the iterative subtraction. Our method provides fast and accurate inference for overlapping GW signals and is highly adaptable to various source types and time separations, offering a potential general solution for overlapping GW signal analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic evolution is the most sensational topic among researchers of modern cosmology. This article explores cosmic evolution in 4D Einstein Gauss Bonnet (EGB) gravity, focusing on mass accretion of compact objects (black holes and wormholes) by dark energy (DE). Three DE models Chevallier Polarski Linder (CPL), Jassal Bagla Padmanabhan (JBP), and Barboza Alcaniz (BA) parameterizations are studied within 4D EGB gravity, with their Hubble parameters derived and compared against observational data (Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and CMB). Bayesian analysis favors the CPL and BA models, with CPL providing the best fit. For black holes, mass accretion of CPL and JBP DE shows transitions between quintessence and phantom eras, while BA and LambdaCDM strictly exhibit quintessence-like behavior, driving cosmic acceleration. In contrast, wormholes exhibit the opposite trend, favoring a phantom-dominated era for the BA and LambdaCDM models. The study highlights the dynamic nature of DE in 4D EGB gravity and its role in cosmic expansion.
