#### Introducing RAFIKI: Refining AGN Feedback in Kinetic Implementations

 - **Abstract**
 Modern cosmological simulations have now matured to the point of reproducing the evolution of realistic galaxy populations across cosmic time. These simulations rely on feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) to quench massive galaxies, yet the details of this process remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we introduce RAFIKI (Refining AGN Feedback In Kinetic Implementations), a novel suite of simulations built upon SIMBA-C that vary the mass loading of AGN-driven winds. Unlike the fiducial SIMBA-C simulation, RAFIKI separates the efficiencies of the two kinetic feedback modes, enabling a detailed study of their impact on galaxies, black holes, and the circumgalactic medium. We explore a range of galaxy and baryon properties in the RAFIKI runs and find that even with enhanced mass loading, the lower-velocity, quasar-type mode cannot quench massive galaxies. However, it plays a significant role in regulating black hole growth and star formation in intermediate-mass galaxies. We also uncover degeneracies in the parameter space that highlight the limited current constraints on AGN feedback. RAFIKI provides a controlled framework to disentangle these degeneracies using current and upcoming observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) have in recent years been recognized as possible sites for gravitational wave sources, leading to a series of numerical studies on the evolution of disk-embedded black hole binaries. The majority of these works have been carried out so far using the shearing box, a local Cartesian domain co-rotating with the binary center-of-mass around the supermassive black hole. The local nature of this framework allows for focusing computational power close to the binary at the expense of detaching the gas flow around the binary from the global dynamics. In this paper, we provide a framework to assess the applicability of the shearing box for studying the long-term evolution of the orbital elements of the embedded binary in viscous hydrodynamic disks. We accomplish this by identifying the conditions under which relevant global timescales are longer than the gas-induced evolution timescale of the embedded binary across various AGN disk models. For black hole masses of interest, we report the existence of radii beyond which the global influence of the disk may be reasonably neglected, supporting the use of the shearing box. More generally, we introduce a systematic approach to link local simulations with the global problem they aim to approximate while providing a way to gauge their accuracy. This will prove to be essential as we seek to add additional physics, such as magnetic fields and radiative transport, to develop more realistic models for black hole binary mergers and their potential electromagnetic signatures in AGN disks.

 - **Abstract**
 In a recent arXiv post, Hawkins & Garcia-Bellido raised doubts on the results of 20-yr long OGLE photometric monitoring, which did not find a large number of gravitational microlensing events in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds. These results implied that primordial black holes and other compact objects with masses from 10^{-8} to 10^3 M_solar cannot comprise a substantial fraction of the Milky Way dark matter halo. Unfortunately, the Hawkins & Garcia-Bellido post contained a number of scientific misrepresentations of our work. Here, we demonstrate that their arguments lack a solid basis or are simply incorrect. As we show below, "and yet they are not found" - compact objects (including primordial black holes) in the dark halo of the Milky Way remain undetected, despite extensive searches.

#### Living on the edge: Testing for compact population features at the edges of parameter space

 - **Abstract**
 Many astrophysical population studies involve parameters that exist on a bounded domain, such as the dimensionless spins of black holes or the eccentricities of planetary orbits, both of which are confined to $[0, 1]$. In such scenarios, we often wish to test for distributions clustered near a boundary, e.g., vanishing spin or orbital eccentricity. Conventional approaches -- whether based on Monte Carlo, kernel density estimators, or machine-learning techniques -- often suffer biases at the boundaries. These biases stem from sparse sampling near the edge, kernel-related smoothing, or artifacts introduced by domain transformations. We introduce a truncated Gaussian mixture model framework that substantially mitigates these issues, enabling accurate inference of narrow, edge-dominated population features. While our method has broad applications to many astronomical domains, we consider gravitational wave catalogs as a concrete example to demonstrate its power. In particular, we maintain agreement with published constraints on the fraction of zero-spin binary black hole systems in the GWTC-3 catalog -- results originally derived at much higher computational cost through dedicated reanalysis of individual events in the catalog. Our method can achieve similarly reliable results with a much lower computational cost. The method is publicly available in the open-source packages gravpop and truncatedgaussianmixtures.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM gives an unprecedented view of the ``central engine'' in active galactic nuclei, providing unique insights into black hole accretion and feedback. We present an analysis of the first XRISM/Resolve spectrum of the Seyfert-1 galaxy Mrk 279, known for its complex line profiles and variability. The data reveal velocity components within the Fe K$_{\alpha}$ emission line that can be associated with the inner face of the molecular torus ($r \geq 10^{4}~GM/c^{2})$, the broad line region (BLR; $r = 1650^{+5780}_{-1480}~GM/c^{2}$), and the inner accretion disk ($r = 81^{+280}_{-75}~GM/c^{2}$). We find evidence of low-velocity, highly ionized gas that contributes an H-like Fe XXVI emission line at 6.97 keV, confirming suggestions from prior low-resolution spectra. The data do not show slow winds in absorption, but two pairs of lines - consistent with He-like and H-like Fe shifted by $v\simeq 0.22c$ and $v\simeq 0.33c$ - improve the fit, and could represent an ultra-fast outflow (UFO). Their addition to the model only reduces the Akaike Information Criterion by 3.6 and 3.5, respectively, signaling modest support. Additional observations are needed to definitively test for the presence of fast X-ray winds in Mrk 279. We discuss these results in the context of the geometry of the central engine in AGN, emerging trends in XRISM studies of AGN, and the nature of the potential UFOs.

#### MG-NECOLA: Fast Neural Emulators for Modified Gravity Cosmologies

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of the large-scale structure (LSS) provide a powerful test of gravity on cosmological scales, but high-resolution N-body simulations of modified gravity (MG) are prohibitively expensive. We present MG-NECOLA, a convolutional neural network that enhances fast MG-PICOLA simulations to near-N-body fidelity at a fraction of the cost. MG-NECOLA reproduces QUIJOTE-MG N-body results in the power spectrum and bispectrum with better than 1% accuracy down to non-linear scales ($k \simeq 1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), while reducing computational time by several orders of magnitude. Importantly, although trained only on $f(R)$ models with massless neutrinos, the network generalizes robustly to scenarios with massive neutrinos, preserving accuracy to within 5% at non-linear scales. This combination of precision and robustness establishes MG-NECOLA as a practical emulator for producing large ensembles of high-fidelity simulations, enabling efficient exploration of modified gravity and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmologies in upcoming surveys.

#### Exploring Joint Observation of the CSST Shear and clustering of astrophysical gravitational wave source measurements

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive forecast for cosmological constraints using the joint observation of the cosmic shear signal from the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) and the clustering signal from the next-generation gravitational wave (GW) detector networks, e.g. Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). By leveraging the angular clustering of astrophysical gravitational wave sources (AGWS) from the third-generation detectors and CSST's weak lensing surveys, we develop a theoretical framework to compute auto- and cross-angular power spectra of AGWS clustering, cosmic shear, and their cross-correlation. Mock datasets are generated by considering the detector-specific selection functions, uncertainties in luminosity distance, and weak lensing systematics. We employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to constrain the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ cosmological parameters, AWGS bias parameters, and star formation rate (SFR) parameters under three detector configurations. Our results demonstrate that the joint observation can achieve sub-$5\%$ precision on $H_0$ ($2.19\%$) and $w$ ($5.7\%$). Besides, the AGWS clustering bias parameters can be constrained to the precision of $4\%-5\%$, enabling the differentiation between stellar-origin compact binaries and primordial black hole scenarios. This multi-messenger approach can also be helpful to resolve mass-redshift degeneracies in the dark siren methods, providing independent validation for the Hubble tension. Our work indicates that the joint observation of the third-generation GW detectors and the CSST can be a powerful probe of the large-scale structure and the cosmic expansion history.

 - **Abstract**
 The hierarchical nature of galaxy formation in the {\Lambda}CDM framework often leads to multiple supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the galactic nuclei. The timescale over which galaxies merge, plays a crucial role in shaping the dynamical evolution and the merger dynamics of their central SMBHs. While binary SMBH evolution is well studied, the long-term dynamics of triple SMBH systems, particularly in non-spherical potentials, remain less understood. We investigate the role of triaxiality in the evolution and dynamics of triple SMBHs with initial conditions drawn from the ROMULUS25 cosmological simulation, using high-resolution gravitodynamical N-body simulations. We explore different orbital configurations and host shapes, tracking the evolution from galactic inspiral to hard binary formation at sub-parsec scales. In all cases, the two most massive SMBHs form a rapidly hardening binary that coalesces within a fraction of a Hubble time, while the third forms a stable hierarchical triple system with the heavier binary, or remains on a wide orbit.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are known to correlate with many properties of their host galaxies, but we do not fully understand these correlations. The strengths (tightness) of these correlations have also been widely debated. In this work, we explore SMBH-host relations in three state-of-the-art cosmological simulations: Illustris, TNG, and EAGLE. Using a variety of machine learning regressors, we measure the scaling relations between black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and galaxy properties including stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), stellar mass ($M_{\star}$), dark matter halo mass ($M_{\rm Halo}$), and the Sersic index. We find that machine learning regressors provide predictive capabilities superior to linear regression in many scaling relations in simulations, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor has the strongest performance. SMBH-host relations have different strengths in different simulations as a result of their sub-grid models. Similar to the observations, the $M_{\rm BH} $-$\sigma$ relation is a strong correlation in all simulations, but in TNG, the $M_{\rm BH} $-$M_{\star}$ relation is even tighter than $M_{\rm BH} $-$\sigma$. EAGLE produces the weakest SMBH-host correlations among all simulations. Low mass SMBHs tend to be poorly correlated with their host galaxies, but including them can still help machines better grasp the correlations in Illustris and TNG. Combining galaxy properties that strongly correlate with $M_{\rm BH} $ but poorly correlate with each other can improve MLP's performance. $M_{\rm BH} $ is most accurately predicted when all galaxy properties are included in the training, suggesting that SMBH-host correlations are fundamentally multi-dimensional in these simulations.

#### Multi-messenger constraints on LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational wave binary black holes merging in AGN disks

 - **Abstract**
 While the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) gravitational wave (GW) detectors have detected over 300 binary black hole (BBH) mergers to date, the first confirmation of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to such an event remains elusive. Previous works have performed searches for counterpart candidates in transient catalogs and have identified active galactic nuclei (AGN) flares coincident with GW events; existing theory predicts that such flares may arise from the interaction of the merger remnant with the embedding accretion disk environment. We apply a statistical formalism to measure the significance of coincidence for the catalog as a whole, measuring that less than 3\% (90\% credible interval) of LVK BBH mergers give rise to observable AGN flares. This result still allows up to $\sim 40\%$ of BBH mergers to originate in AGN disks. We also examine the individual coincidences of each merger/flare pairing, determining that in all cases the flares are more likely to belong to a background population of flares not associated with GW events. Our results are consistent with theoretical predictions accounting for the observability of EM counterparts in AGN disks, as well as based on the fact that the most massive AGNs (such as those included in the search) are not expected to harbor the majority of the BBHs. We emphasize that developing both the means to distinguish BBH counterpart flares from background AGN flares and an understanding of which BBHs are most likely to produce AGN flares as counterparts is critical to optimize the use of follow-up resources.

 - **Abstract**
 SS\,433 is one of the most extreme Galactic X-ray binaries, exhibiting semi-relativistic jets and super-critical accretion, and harboring a compact object, likely a black hole. Despite decades of observation and modeling, the precise nature of its progenitor binary remains uncertain. To estimate the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) properties of binaries that evolve into SS\,433-like systems, we apply simulation-based calibration to Bayesian inference and convolve a multivariate Gaussian likelihood constructed from six measured binary parameters of SS\,433 with the isolated binary evolution model \textsc{COSMIC}. Employing the dynamic nested sampler of \texttt{dynesty}, we perform posterior inference over a ten-dimensional progenitor parameter space defined by the masses, orbital parameters, mass transfer possibilities, and natal kick velocity. We find that SS\,433-like systems arise from specific regions of binary evolution parameter space depending on key assumptions, such as the mass transfer rate and uncertainty taken from observations. Our simulation-based calibration framework, implemented with a suite of machine learning algorithms and scored by a heuristic reliability metric, allows us to iteratively build posterior distributions of the progenitors of SS\,433-like systems. This analysis reveals 90\% confidence intervals for the ZAMS primary mass $(8, 11)$ M$_\odot$, secondary mass $(32, 40)$ M$_\odot $, orbital period $(136, 2259)$ days, eccentricity $(0.26, 0.6)$, common envelope evolution efficiency $(0.44, 0.76)$, accreted fraction in stable mass transfer $(0.22, 0.6)$, and black hole natal kick velocity magnitude $(5, 68)$ km/s. These results demonstrate the feasibility of direct probabilistic inference of X-ray binary progenitors to offer new insights into the evolution of high-accretion-rate systems such as SS\,433.

#### Time-Dependent Black Hole Lensing and the Unified Weak-to-Strong Deflection Framework

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19849

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19849

 - **Abstract**
 We present a fully analytical framework that unifies weak-field and strong-deflection lensing of light in a time-dependent, perturbed Schwarzschild spacetime. The spacetime dynamics are modeled by a single, axisymmetric, even-parity quasinormal mode with $\ell=2$, $m=0$ and complex frequency $\omega$. Working to first order in a small perturbation amplitude while keeping background null geodesics exact, we derive a time-dependent line-of-sight (Born) expression for the screen-plane deflection measured by a static observer at large radius. From the same integral, an asymptotic expansion yields the familiar weak-field $1/b$ law with a ringdown-frequency correction that drives a harmonic centroid wobble, whereas a near-photon-sphere expansion produces a time-dependent generalization of the logarithmic strong-deflection limit with modulated coefficients, including a small oscillation of the critical impact parameter. An observer tetrad built from the background static frame ensures that all screen-plane quantities like centroid motion, multi-image hierarchy, and time delays, and photon-ring morphology are gauge-safe at first order. We provide explicit matching across regimes, showing that the near-critical coefficients governing spacing and ring-radius modulations are encoded in the same Born kernel that controls the weak-field correction. The result is a coherent, purely theoretical account of how ringdown physics imprints on imaging observables without numerical ray tracing.

#### Statistical Constraints on Anisotropic Bianchi-III Cosmology in $f(R,T)$-Gravity Using MCMC Methods

 - **Abstract**
 Anisotropic Bianchi type-III cosmology is examined within the framework of f(R,T) gravity, where R denotes the Ricci scalar and T the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. In this work, we investigate the statistical constraints on anisotropic Bianchi type-III cosmology within the framework of f(R,T) gravity. The specific choice $f(R,T)=R+2f(T)$ is considered and exact solutions are derived for the background dynamics of the model. The physical parameters, such as the Hubble parameter H(z), spatial volume V(z), energy density $\rho(z)$, and pressure p(z), are derived and their evolutionary behaviors are analyzed. To examine the observational viability of the model, we employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and perform a comprehensive statistical analysis using the latest observational datasets, including the Hubble parameter measurements, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the Pantheon compilation of type Ia supernovae. The combined data analysis provides constraints on the free parameters of the model and allows a comparison with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our results show that the anisotropic Bianchi-III universe in f(R,T) gravity can successfully accommodate current observational data, offering new insights into the role of matter-geometry coupling in the late-time cosmic acceleration.

#### Simple Analytic Estimate of Black Hole Shadow Size in an Expanding Universe

 - **Abstract**
 The apparent shadow of a black hole provides one of the most direct probes of strong-field general relativity. While the shadow size in asymptotically flat spacetimes is well understood, the influence of cosmic expansion on its apparent angular diameter remains less explored. In this work, we present a simple analytic framework to estimate the shadow size of a non-rotating black hole embedded in an expanding universe. By combining the local Schwarzschild geometry with large-scale cosmological dynamics through the McVittie and Kottler metrics, we derive a compact relation between the shadow angular size and the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$. This approach captures the essential dependence on cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, while remaining analytically tractable. We further perform numerical estimates to quantify the redshift dependence of the apparent shadow size, showing that the effect of cosmic expansion is negligible for nearby sources but becomes relevant for high-redshift black holes. Our results demonstrate a clear conceptual connection between strong-gravity optics and cosmological expansion, providing a pedagogically transparent and physically motivated extension of black hole shadow theory to a cosmological context.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore how inflationary features shape the early stages of cosmic structure formation. Using the transfer function formalism, we trace the evolution of primordial perturbations, showing how causal physics and oscillatory signatures from inflation influence the matter power spectrum. The variance of smoothed density fields is then applied to model the collapse of overdense regions and predict dark matter halo abundances through the Press-Schechter framework. Extending to the baryonic sector, we analyze primordial gas collapse in minihalos, emphasizing molecular hydrogen cooling and the thermochemical pathways leading to Population III star formation. Finally, we examine primordial black holes as potential seeds for early galaxies, connecting their accretion-driven growth to the stellar masses and disk properties of high-redshift systems. Our results indicate that oscillatory features from inflation can leave measurable imprints on halo abundances and early galaxy properties, providing a testable link between high-energy physics and astrophysical observations with JWST

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole spectroscopy allows to infer the properties of the remnant of a binary black hole coalescence. Motivated by the recent proposal that a black hole's information load can alter its classical response to small perturbations, an effect known as the swift memory burden, we develop a minimal phenomenological framework to analyze the ringdown of a binary black hole merger and confront it with the data from the GW250114 event. We perform a Bayesian analysis combining the frequencies of the (220) and (440) quasi-normal modes and obtain a lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 2$, where $p$ controls how the gaps reopen when the black hole's master mode occupation departs from the critical value. Moreover, using a Fisher information matrix (high signal-to-noise ratio) approximation, we forecast the lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 5$ for a GW250114-like event observed with Cosmic Explorer. Our results disfavour rapid gap reopening, shedding light on how the swift memory burden effect can be probed with current and next-generation detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 Scalar fields of masses between $10^{-21}\rm{eV}/c^2$ and $10^{-11} \rm{eV}/c^2$ can exhibit enhanced gravitational interactions with black holes, and form scalar clouds around them. Such a cloud modifies the dynamics of a coalescing black-hole binary, and the resulting gravitational waves may provide a new channel to detect light scalar fields, such as axion-like particles or wave-like dark matter candidates. In this work we simulate a series of black-hole mergers with mass ratios $q=1$ and $q=1/2$, immersed in an scalar field overdensity with masses in the range $M\mu_{\rm{S}} \in[0,1.0]$. To do so, we implemented a constraint-satisfying initial data solver based on the puncture method, we improved the accuracy of our open-source software Canuda to eighth order finite differences, and we reduced the initial orbital eccentricity. We investigate the impact of the scalar mass on the gravitational and scalar radiation. We find that binaries can undergo a delayed or an accelerated merger with respect to the vacuum. Our study highlights the challenge and importance of accurately modeling black-hole binaries in dark matter environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the thermodynamics of a novel solution for the Reissner-Nordström-Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole, uniquely incorporating the Gauss-Bonnet term. Unlike previous studies that primarily focused on standard General Relativity or other modifications, this inclusion allows for a modified entropy formulation, facilitating the computation of key thermodynamic quantities such as Gibbs free energy, the first law of thermodynamics, the equation of state, and Hawking temperature. We identify critical points and graphically represent the relationship between temperature and Gibbs free energy as a function of the horizon radius. Ultimately, we assess the thermal stability of the Reissner-Nordström-AdS black hole within the framework of Gauss-Bonnet gravity, emphasizing the influence of the Gauss-Bonnet term unlike previous studies that primarily focused on standard General Relativity or other modifications. As a result, it is found that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling significantly alters the thermodynamic behavior and stability structure of the black hole, revealing richer phase transition phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we further develop a recently proposed theory of time based on wavefunction collapse in general relativity. It is based on the postulations that quantum states, which violate the momentum and Hamiltonian constraints, represent instances of time, and stochastic fluctuations of the lapse and shift generate the time evolution under which an initial state gradually collapses toward a diffeomorphism-invariant state. Under the wavefunction collapse, the scale factor monotonically increases, thus acting as a clock. The scalar, vector, and tensor gravitons arise as physical excitations, and the arrow of time for their evolution is set by the initial state. In the long-time limit, the tensor gravitons exhibit emergent unitary dynamics. However, the extra modes are strongly damped due to the non-unitary dynamics that suppress the constraint-violating excitations. The vector mode is uniformly suppressed over all length scales, but the decay rate of the scalar is proportional to its wave vector. This makes the latter a viable candidate for dark matter; excitations with large wavelengths survive over long periods, contributing to long-range interactions, while the fast decay of short-wavelength modes renders them undetectable without sufficient temporal resolution. These are demonstrated for the cosmological constant-dominated universe through semi-classical and adiabatic approximations, which are controlled in the limit of large space dimension.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit our earlier work and investigate the bound state perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. The bound sates are defined as the perturbations in the interior of the black hole with an imaginary spectrum which are regular at the center of black hole while their time-dependent profile falls off exponentially on the event horizon. Using the scale factor in the expanding direction in the interior of the black hole as the clock, we rewrite the corresponding Regge-Wheeler equation and solve it semi-analytically as well as numerically. We confirm that the bound state solutions exist for scalar, vector and axial tensor perturbations. It is shown that for a given value of $\ell >s$, there are total $\ell-s$ such bound states. We obtain the universal lower bound $2 G M \omega_I >1$ for the spectrum of bound state which is asymptotically saturated in the large $\ell$ limit. Furthermore, we obtain an upper bound on the spectrum of axial perturbations which for large $\ell$ scales like $2 G M \omega_I \lesssim 0.04\, \ell^4 $. As observed recently, these bound states have the curious property that the profile of the total wave function has a non-zero magnitude near the future event horizon.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, some of us have obtained exact charged spherically symmetric black hole solutions within the framework of bumblebee gravity, where the Lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken due to the nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the bumblebee field. In this work, we investigate the quasinormal modes of this black hole. We compute the quasinormal frequencies corresponding to the scalar perturbation and the gravito-electromagnetic coupled perturbation using both the continued fraction method and the asymptotic iteration method. A detailed comparison of the results obtained from the two approaches is presented to evaluate their accuracy and efficiency in this Lorentz-violating background.

 - **Abstract**
 Within a framework requiring a well-defined event horizon and matter obeying the weak energy condition, we employ gravitational decoupling method to construct non-singular hairy black holes: spherically or axially symmetric. These solutions arise from a deformation of the Minkowski vacuum, where the maximum deformation can yield the Schwarzschild metric for the static case, and the Kerr geometry for the stationary case, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational weak lensing of neutrinos in the presence of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Dehnen-type dark matter halo is investigated. The event horizon structure is explored, and the existence of the BH is studied in two different slices of the parameter space. Additionally, we derive analytic expressions for the oscillation phase and transition probabilities for both radial and non-radial neutrino propagation. Finally, we use a two-flavor toy model, and numerically analyze how the dark matter halo parameters as density and scale radius, affect oscillation probabilities and examine the role of decoherence. The results show that the presence of a dark matter halo modifies the oscillation phase and damping factor, leading to measurable deviations from the standard Schwarzschild BH case. These findings suggest that neutrino oscillations could, in principle, serve as a probe for dark matter distributions around compact astrophysical objects.

 - **Abstract**
 It is common knowledge that black holes necessarily contain a region where general relativity breaks down, due to the inevitable formation of either a curvature singularity or a Cauchy horizon. In this work we challenge this view by analyzing a charged spherically symmetric black hole formed through gravitational collapse and evaporating via Hawking radiation. We show that the electromagnetic repulsion and the violation of energy conditions due to the presence of Hawking radiation are be sufficient to avoid the formation of both a singularity and a Cauchy horizon. We argue that a similar mechanism may apply to astrophysical black holes in which the role of the electric charge is replaced by the angular momentum.

 - **Abstract**
 For a unitary description of an evaporating black hole, one usually chooses the time slices that cover only outside of the event horizon, which is mostly problem-free because the event horizon is not encountered. However, is there any justification for avoiding time slices that cover inside the event horizon? To answer the question, we investigate the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, where the time slices can cover both inside and outside the event horizon. We find that one can reasonably construct a wave packet that covers outside, but the wave function must be annihilated near the event horizon. This observation strongly suggests that we cannot choose a coherent state for a spacelike hypersurface that crosses the event horizon. To explain the unitary time evolution, we must keep the slices as coherent states; hence, they must always be outside the event horizon. In contrast, inside the horizon, we cannot have a single coherent state of a classical spacetime. Hence, the interior must be a superposition of several coherent states, which implies that there exists a horizon-scale uncertainty and a black hole should be viewed as a highly quantum macroscopic object. We provide a synthetic approach to understanding the information loss paradox from this perspective.

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of gravitational waves and advances in black hole imaging have opened new opportunities to probe exotic physics in strong-field regimes. Building upon a recent black hole solution in Einstein gravity coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics and exotic matter sources-specifically a cloud of strings and a quintessence field--we study the perturbative dynamics, thermodynamic behavior, and quantum transmission characteristics in anti-de Sitter spacetime. The black hole, defined by its mass, nonlinear magnetic charge, string cloud, and quintessence parameters, exhibits modified spacetime geometry, horizon structure, Hawking temperature, and effective potentials governing field propagation. We derive Schrödinger-like equations for massless scalar, electromagnetic, and fermionic perturbations, exploring how these sources jointly shape the potential barriers. The Hawking temperature shows strong dependence on the horizon radius and nonlinear charge, differing markedly from asymptotically flat cases due to the cosmological constant. Greybody factors, describing Hawking radiation transmission probabilities, are computed for all field spins via turning point analysis. A notable result arises in the fermionic sector: positive and negative helicity modes attain maximal transmission at distinct quintessence normalization values, revealing helicity-dependent coupling absent in bosonic channels. This asymmetry suggests a potential observational signature of spin-exotic matter interactions, offering new insights into detecting quintessence through black hole radiation spectra. Our results extend previous perturbative analyses by incorporating nonlinear electrodynamics, cosmic strings, and quintessence effects--linking quantum radiation studies to gravitational wave astronomy and early-universe cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Three dimensional hyperbolic manifolds have accumulation points in the spectrum of their volumes, leading to a divergence in the sum over topologies. The limit points are cusped hyperbolic manifolds, and we propose to renormalize the sum by including the cusped manifold as a counterterm. This gives a reinterpretation of the zeta-function regularization procedure used by Maloney and Witten in the sum over SL(2,Z) black holes. For pure N = 1 supergravity, cusps with even spin structure can be used in a similar way. Cusps with odd spin structure are not needed to cancel any divergence, but they find an application by making the index nonzero.

 - **Abstract**
 The covariant phase space formalism in general relativity is a covariant method for constructing the symplectic two-form, Hamiltonian and other conserved charges on the phase space of solutions to the Einstein equation with classical matter. In this note, we consider a generalization of this formalism to the semi-classical Einstein equation coupled to quantum matter. Given a family of solutions in semi-classical gravity, we define the semi-classical symplectic two-form -- a natural generalization of the classical sympelctic two-form -- as the sum of the gravitational symplectic form and the Berry curvature associated to the quantum state of matter. We show that the semi-classical symplectic two-form is independent of the Cauchy slice, and satisfies the quantum generalization of the classical Hollands-Iyer-Wald identity. For small perturbations, we also extend our discussion to gauge-invariantly defined subregions of spacetime, where the quantum contribution is replaced by the Berry curvature of certain special purifications involving the Connes cocycle. In the AdS/CFT context, the semi-classical symplectic form defined here is naturally dual to the Berry curvature in the boundary CFT.

#### Thermodynamics and topological classifications of static non-extremal four-charge AdS black hole in the five-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$, $STU-W^2U$ gauged supergravity

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate thermodynamical aspects of a novel static non-extremal black hole solution in the five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space carrying four independent electric charge parameters and with a negative cosmological constant, within the framework of $D=5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets specified by the pre-potential $\mathcal{V} = STU -W^2U \equiv 1$. A central outcome of our work is the demonstration that the thermodynamics of this solution consistently satisfies both the differential and integral forms of the first law of black hole thermodynamics. When the fourth charge is set to zero, our configuration reduces to the known three-charge static non-extremal AdS$_5$ black hole within the gauged $STU$ model, and its thermodynamic behavior connects smoothly to that limit. Finally, we also provide a brief discussion about topological classifications of its thermodynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes exist all over our Universe, possessing a very wide range of masses. At the moment, they serve as a probe to test general relativity at astrophysical scales, but in the future they may also give us information about gravity at the microscale. Black holes seem to have thermodynamic properties, such as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, which are important when considering black holes with size of a few centimeters or smaller. Since entropy in statistical mechanics is related to the number of microstates of a system, several questions arise: what gives rise to the black hole entropy? Can it be explained by a quantum description of gravity? In order to further study these questions, the connection between thermodynamics and gravity must be explored at the microscale. In this doctoral thesis, we aim to understand this connection using two descrip-tions that yield the thermodynamics of curved spacetimes. We start by imposing the first law of thermodynamics to a charged self-gravitating matter thin shell in higher dimensions and choose equations of state which allow the study of the black hole limit and the recovery of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we use the Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity to construct statistical ensembles of black hole spacetimes and self-gravitating matter, in order to study semiclassically the phase transitions between hot matter and black holes. We show the power of the formalism in obtaining the thermodynamic properties of curved spacetimes. Namely, we study the canonical and grand canonical ensemble of charged black holes inside a cavity, which may have a finite or infinite radius. We construct ensembles of a self-gravitating matter thin shell, both in anti-de Sitter and in asymptotically flat spaces, in order to understand the thermodynamic features of the shell and the possible phase transitions to black hole configurations.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a symmetry argument for the vanishing and non-renormalization of static Love numbers for spherically symmetric black holes at full nonlinear order in four-dimensional General Relativity. The symmetry is realized both in full GR and in the worldline EFT, allowing for a unified treatment and proving both vanishing and non-renormalization to all orders. This closes some loop-holes in previous arguments that neglected nonlinearities in the worldline EFT, and extends previous vanishing results to all nonlinear static tides. When extended to higher-dimensional gravity, these arguments also explain the pattern of vanishing and running static Love numbers of electric and tensor type, and predict new results at the nonlinear order. We also apply our findings to the tidal response of shift-symmetric scalar fields, predicting the vanishing of even order nonlinear static Love numbers and unifying these statements with the no-hair theorem (and its violations).

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a general framework for electromagnetic potential-charge contributions to the first law of black hole mechanics, applicable to dynamical first-order perturbations of stationary black objects with possibly non-compact bifurcate Killing horizons. Working in the covariant phase space formalism, we derive both comparison and physical process versions of the first law. We consider generic diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity in $D$ spacetime dimensions, containing non-minimally coupled abelian $p$-form gauge fields. The pullback of the gauge field to the horizon is allowed to diverge while its field strength remains smooth, yielding gauge-invariant electric potential-charge pairs in the first law. We further extend the construction to include magnetic charges by developing a bundle-covariant, gauge-invariant prescription that fixes the Jacobson-Kang-Myers ambiguity in the improved Noether charge. Electric and magnetic charges are, respectively, associated with non-trivial $(D - p - 1)$- and $(p + 1)$-cycles of the horizon cross-section, whose homology classes determine the number of independent potential-charge pairs through the Betti numbers $b_{D - p - 1}$ and $b_{p + 1}$. Further, the dynamical gravitational entropy entering the first law is identified with the gauge-invariant part of the improved Noether charge, giving a gauge-invariant extension of the recent proposal by Hollands, Wald and Zhang. We illustrate our framework with dyonic AdS black holes, dipole black rings, and charged black branes.

#### Theta-term in Russian Doll Model: phase structure, quantum metric and BPS multifractality

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the phase structure of the deterministic and disordered versions of the Russian Doll Model (RDM), which is a generalization of Richardson model of superconductivity in a finite system with time-reversal symmetry breaking parameter $\theta$. It is one of the simplest examples of the cyclic RG where $\log N$ plays the role of the RG time. The deterministic model is integrable and shares the same Bethe Ansatz (BA) equations with the inhomogeneous twisted XXX spin chain. We analyze the quantum metric, the Berry curvature, and the fractal dimension in the sector with a single Cooper pair. A rich phase structure in the $(\theta,\gamma)$ parameter plane is found, where $\gamma \log N$ quantifies the hopping term. For the deterministic RDM we clearly identify the extended domain of non-ergodic multifractal phase on the $(\theta,\gamma)$ parameter plane supporting the reentrance transitions between the localized, ergodic, and multifractal phases. We find the pattern of phase transitions in the global charge $Q(\theta,\gamma)$, which arises from the BA equation. In particular, in the multifractal phase in the deterministic model $Q(\gamma)$ exhibits the analogue of "charge concentration" and fortuity phenomena discussed in the context of black hole microstates at finite $N$. The BA equations in RDM exactly coincide with the equations defining the ground states in the theory on the worldvolume of the vortex strings in $N_F=2N_C$ ${\cal N}=2$ SQCD at a strong coupling point $\frac{1}{g_{YM}^2}=0$ with identification $\theta_{RDM}= \theta_{4D}-\pi$. We conjecture that the Hamiltonian of the RDM model describes the mixing in particular 2d-4d BPS sector of the Hilbert space. Our findings provide an example of the BPS multifractality regime for the probe operator in the sector of Hilbert space, and we comment on the possible application to dense QCD with $\theta$ term.
