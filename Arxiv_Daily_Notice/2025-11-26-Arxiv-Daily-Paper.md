#### Estimating the masses of Narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies using damped random walk method

 - **Abstract**
 Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) are a subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), commonly associated with rapidly accreting, relatively low-mass black holes ($10^6$ - $10^8 M_\odot$) hosted in spiral galaxies. Although typically considered to have high Eddington ratios, recent observations, particularly of $\gamma$-ray-emitting NLSy1s, have raised questions about their true black hole masses, with some estimates approaching those of Broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLSy1) systems. In this work, we present the recalibrated mass estimations for a large sample of NLSy1s galaxies with z $<0.8$. We apply the damped random walk (DRW) formalism to a comparison set of 1,141 NLSy1 and 1,143 BLSy1 galaxies, matched in redshift and bolometric luminosity using SDSS DR17 spectroscopy. Our analysis employs a multivariate calibration that incorporates both the Eddington ratio and the rest-frame wavelength to refine the mass estimates. We obtain median DRW-based black hole masses of $\text{log}(M_{\text{BH}}^{\text{DRW}}/M_\odot) = 6.25 \pm 0.65$ for NLSy1s and $7.07 \pm 0.67$ for BLSy1s, in agreement with their respective virial mass distributions. Furthermore, we identify strong inverse trends between the variability amplitude and both optical luminosity and FeII emission strength, consistent with a scenario where higher accretion rates suppress long-term optical variability. These findings reinforce the view that NLSy1s harbor smaller black holes and highlight the value of variability-based approaches in tracing AGN accretion properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding black hole-galaxy co-evolution and the role of AGN feedback requires complete AGN samples, including heavily obscured systems. In this work, we present the first UV line-selected ([Nev]3426 and CIV1549) sample of obscured AGN with full X-ray-to-radio coverage, assembled by combining data from the Chandra COSMOS Legacy survey, the COSMOS2020 catalogue, IR photometry from XID+, and radio observations from the VLA and MIGHTEE surveys. Using CIGALE to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, we analyse 184 obscured AGN at 0.6 < z < 1.2 and 1.5 < z < 3.1, enabling detailed measurements of AGN and host galaxy properties, and direct comparison with SIMBA hydrodynamical simulations. We find that X-ray and radio data are essential for accurate SED fits, with the radio band proving critical when X-ray detections are missing or in cases of poor IR coverage. Comparisons with matched non-active galaxies and simulations suggest that the [NeV]-selected sources are in a pre-quenching stage, while the CIV-selected ones are likely quenched by AGN activity. Our results indicate that [NeV] and CIV selections target galaxies in a transient phase of their co-evolution, characterised by intense, obscured accretion, and pave the way for future extensions with upcoming large area high-z spectroscopic surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed an abundance of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshifts ($z > 3$), pushing the limits of black hole (BH) science in the early Universe. Results have claimed that these BHs are significantly more massive than expected from the BH mass-host galaxy stellar mass relation derived from the local Universe. We present a comprehensive census of the BH populations in the early Universe through a detailed stacking analysis of galaxy populations, binned by luminosity and redshift, using JWST spectroscopy from the CEERS, JADES, RUBIES, and GLASS extragalactic deep field surveys. Broad H$\alpha$ detections in $31\%$ of the stacked spectra (5/16 bins) imply median BH masses of $10^{5.21} - 10^{6.13}~ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ and the stacked SEDs of these bins indicate median stellar masses of $10^{7.84} - 10^{8.56} ~\rm{M_{\odot}}$. This suggests that the median galaxy hosts a BH that is at most a factor of 10 times over-massive compared to its host galaxy and lies closer to the locally derived $M_{BH}-M_*$ relation. We investigate the seeding properties of the inferred BHs and find that they can be well-explained by a light stellar remnant seed undergoing moderate Eddington accretion. Our results indicate that individual detections of AGN are more likely to sample the upper envelope of the $M_{BH}-M_*$ distribution, while stacking on ``normal" galaxies and searching for AGN signatures can overcome the selection bias of individual detections.

#### Alignment of radio jets in the microquasar V4641 Sagittarii with its high-energy structures

 - **Abstract**
 V4641 Sagittarii (V4641 Sgr) is a unique Galactic microquasar system featuring a stellar-mass black hole accreting matter from a massive companion. One of its intriguing features is the presence of relativistic radio jets almost perpendicular to the observed extended gamma-ray emission, implying significant propagation effects or interactions with the Galactic magnetic field. Here we report observational evidence that the radio jet and the very high-energy (VHE) and ultra high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray emission could be aligned along a common axis, indicating a co-spatial or co-directional origin. This alignment supports a model where synchrotron radio emission, VHE and UHE gamma rays are produced within a single, highly collimated relativistic outflow. Our findings favor scenarios of in-situ particle acceleration up to hundreds of TeV, challenge previous interpretations involving large-scale particle diffusion, and simplify the geometric modeling of the source. This case highlights the potential of V4641 Sgr as a PeVatron candidate within our Galaxy and provides a benchmark for understanding jet composition and magnetic structure in microquasars.

 - **Abstract**
 On August 17$^{\rm th}$ 2017, observatories worldwide made a landmark detection: gravitational waves and light from a binary neutron star merger. This event revolutionized our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology, and gravitation. In this proceeding of the 2025 International Congress of Basic Science, we describe how it transformed our view of cosmic acceleration (dark energy). The near-simultaneous arrival of light and gravitational waves shows that their speeds agree to within one part in $10^{15}$, excluding large classes of modified gravity theories and interactions between dark energy and matter.

#### Cold Dark Matter and Dark Energy Based on an Analogy with Superconductivity

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel candidate for cold dark matter consisting of condensed Cooper pairs in a theory of interacting fermions with broken chiral symmetry. Establishing the thermal history from the early radiation era to the present, the fermions are shown to behave like standard radiation at high temperatures, but then experience a critical era decaying faster than radiation, akin to freeze-out that sets the relic abundance. Through a second-order phase transition, fermion - antifermion pairs condense and the system asymptotes towards zero temperature and pressure. By the present era, the non-relativistic, massive condensate decays slightly faster than in the standard scenario -- a unique prediction that may be tested by combined measurements of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure. We also show that in the case of massive fermions, the phase transition is frustrated, and freeze-out instead leaves a residual, long-lived

#### Symbiotic Stars (Including T Corona Borealis) Are Not Immediate Progenitors of Normal Type Ia Supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 A popular solution to the Type Ia supernova (SNIa) progenitor problem is that the immediate progenitors are symbiotic star systems. This solution requires that the companion star of the exploding white dwarf must be a red giant star with a heavy stellar wind. This has been tested for 189 normal SNIa, with all tested systems being proven to not have the required red giant: (A) Zero-out-of-9 normal type Ia supernova remnants have any red giant ex-companion star near the center with limits of $M_V$$>$0.0. (B) Zero-out-of-2 normal SNIa in nearby galaxies have any red giant at the position as seen in archival pre-eruption images by HST to limits of $M_V$$>$0.0. (C and D) Zero-out-of-111 normal SNIa have any detected hydrogen or helium emission lines in their eruption spectra, with limits on entrained gas of $M_{\rm H}$$<$0.22 and $M_{\rm He}$$<$0.07 M$_{\odot}$, which is the minimum mass lost by a red giant in a nearby blastwave. (E and F) Zero-out-of-9 nearby normal SNIa were detected in the radio or X-rays, as required from the ejecta/wind impact, to limits of $\dot{M}_{\rm wind}$$<$3$\times$$10^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. (G) Zero-out-of-$\sim$69 normal SNIa display any brightening in the first few days to limits of $M_V$$>$$-$18, as required for a red giant companion when we are looking down its shadowcone. With zero-out-of-189 normal SNIa having any possibility of having a red giant companion, the fraction of SNIa with symbiotic progenitors is $<$0.53%. The overwhelming conclusion is that normal SNIa are not from symbiotic-progenitors in any measurable fraction.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discoveries have unveiled an abundance of faint and massive Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) at high redshifts (z=4-9), that surpass by 10 to 100 times the extrapolated bolometric (Bol) and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions (LF) from previous AGN campaigns. The two main models that are put forward to explain these observations correspond to light seeds (150 Msol) accreting in episodes of super Eddington, and heavy seeds ($10^3$ - $10^5$ Msol) growing at the Eddington limit. Future gravitational observatories like the Laser Interferometer Satellite Antenna (LISA) will help disentangle these models by reporting the BH-BH merger events from mid to high redshifts. Aims. This work aims to report the predicted merger rates in the heavy seed scenario in light of recent JWST data. In our models we explore (i) instantaneous merging between BHs, (ii) delayed merging after a dynamical timescale, as well as extreme spin configurations (a=0.99, a=-0.99) to bracket BH mass growth. Methods. We use Delphi, a semi-analytical model that tracks baryonic physics over a hierarchical evolution of dark matter halos through cosmic time within the first billion years of the Universe. We calibrate this model for it to simultaneously reproduce galaxy and JWST-AGNs observables. Results. We show reasonable agreement with the Bolometric Luminosity function at z=6, where BHs must accrete 10-100 times more gas than in previous works calibrated to pre-JWST data. However, we underpredict (overpredict) the bright end $10^45.5$ erg s$^-1$ (all luminosity range) at z=7 (z=5) by 1-3.2 dex (0.22-1.6 dex). Regarding BH-BH merger events, the instantaneous (delayed) models predict a total of 28.06 (19.61) yr$^-1$ for BHs at z>=5, which is within the range of merger rates reported in previous literature.

#### Inferring the Impacts of Baryonic Feedback from Kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich Cross-Correlations

 - **Abstract**
 The complex processes of baryonic feedback associated with galaxy evolution are still poorly understood, and their impact on the clustering of matter on small scales remains difficult to quantify. While many fitting functions and emulators exist to model the matter power spectrum, their input parameters are not directly observable. However, recent studies using hydrodynamical simulations have identified a promising correlation between the gas content of halos and changes to the matter power spectrum from feedback. Building on these findings, we create the first fully data-driven power spectrum emulator. We utilize the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect, a secondary anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background, as a tracer of free electrons in and around halos. We train a neural network to learn the mapping between the suppression of the matter power spectrum and the shape of the kSZ power spectrum extracted with a radial velocity template. We train and validate our algorithm using the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, which encompasses a wide range of feedback models. Our emulator can reconstruct the matter power spectrum at the sub-percent level for scales $k\leq 5\;h/$Mpc and $0.2\leq z \leq 1.25$ directly from the data. Our model is robust and retains percent-level accuracy even for feedback models and cosmological parameter values not seen during training (except in a few extreme cases drastically different from the fiducial model). Due to its robustness, our algorithm offers a new way to identify the sources of suppression in the matter power spectrum, breaking the degeneracies between baryonic feedback and new physics. Finally, we present a forecast for reconstruction of the matter power spectrum combining maps of the microwave background anisotropies from a Simons Observatory-like experiment and galaxy catalogs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of the cosmological constant is a mystery. We don't understand its quantum origin but we associate it with the actual acceleration of the universe because it is the simplest description we had until recently of the present cosmological observations. However, this may change with the next generation of experiments. If we can convince ourselves that the cosmic acceleration is not due to a constant, this would open up new fascinating avenues. By exploring the simplest cosmological model in the bulk, that of an empty and flat space with a cosmological constant $\Lambda$, we find that its holographic dual makes sense as a theory of fundamental quantum degrees of freedom at the boundary. Moreover, we find that an observer in the bulk, making long-range (electromagnetic and gravitational) observations, cannot distinguish the acceleration induced by the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ from that induced by the thermodynamic properties of the boundary, the de Sitter horizon. By including matter in the bulk we extend this holographic principle to GREA, where the quantum d.o.f. associated with the evolving boundary of the causal horizon induces an entropic acceleration that varies in time. Future observations will determine whether our causal horizon is responsible for the present acceleration and whether our universe will end in de Sitter or Minkowski.

#### Quasinormal modes of scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational perturbations in slowly rotating Kalb-Ramond black holes

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate quasinormal modes (QNMs) of scalar, electromagnetic, and axial gravitational perturbations in slowly rotating Kalb-Ramond (KR) black holes, where an antisymmetric tensor field induces spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. Working consistently to first order in the dimensionless spin parameter, we derive the corresponding master equations and compute the QNM spectrum using both the continued-fraction and matrix methods, finding excellent agreement. Lorentz violation modifies the oscillation and damping rates in a unified manner across all perturbative sectors: the real part of the QNM frequency increases monotonically with the Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$, while the imaginary part becomes more negative. Axial gravitational modes exhibit the strongest response, revealing an intrinsic theoretical bound $\ell< 0.5$, beyond which the spectrum approaches an extremal behavior. Our results highlight the potential of gravitational-wave spectroscopy to probe Lorentz-violating signatures in KR gravity.

#### On Modelling the Surfaces of Celestial Bodies in Quantum Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss how to model the surface of celestial bodies (such as stars) in quantum gravity to ensure the regularity of quantum corrections to classical solutions of general relativity at the surface of such bodies. Specifically, we use the Vilkovisky--DeWitt unique effective action to calculate universal quantum corrections to the exterior metric for a class of stellar models. Previous descriptions, obtained via a Heaviside density profile, are ``pathological'' at the surface of the star due to the divergence of the metric functions and associated curvature invariants. Introducing a modified version of the Tolman VII density profile, we determine the minimal degree of differentiability required for this function to generate regular quantum corrections at the star's surface.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves from binary black hole (BBH) mergers allow us to test general relativity in the strong-field, high-curvature regime. However, existing gravitational wave-based tests have so far assumed non-eccentric signal sources, limiting their applicability to more general astrophysical scenarios. In this work, we present pTEOBResumS, a new parametrized inspiral-merger-ringdown model for null tests of GR that incorporates both orbital eccentricity and spin precession. Building on the effective-one-body model TEOBResumS-Dalí, we introduce parametrized deviations from GR both in the inspiral and the merger-ringdown regimes. We validate the model via parameter estimation of synthetic signals, including from numerical relativity simulations of BBHs and a boson star binary. These allow us to establish the model's consistency, demonstrate its capability to identify beyond-GR effects, and gauge the impact of eccentricity in tests of GR. We then analyze a set of BBH events from the first three LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs, testing whether they are best explained by a GR or non-GR waveform, under either the eccentric, spin-aligned or precessing, quasi-circular hypotheses. We find no significant statistical evidence in favor of deviations from GR. Consistent with previous works, we infer a mild preference for longer remnant quasi-normal mode damping times than expected in GR, though the limited sample and potential systematics reduce its significance. In addition, when weighting by signal strength, joint posteriors combining the individual events are still compatible with GR. We find no strong evidence for imprints of orbital eccentricity in the analyzed events, with the exception of GW200129. For this, our analysis finds a strong preference for an eccentric, GR-consistent description, although as previous works have noted this result could be influenced by data quality issues.

#### Effective-one-body modelling of eccentric supermassive black hole binaries for Pulsar Timing Array

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) observations will detect gravitational waves (GWs) from the early inspiral phase of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) with orbital periods of weeks to years. Current PTA analyses generally assume circular binaries; however, dynamical interactions with the surrounding environment can prevent complete circularisation, allowing SMBHBs to retain appreciable eccentricities. In this work, we present a gravitational waveform model for eccentric binaries based on the Effective-One-Body (EOB) formalism, designed for continuous GW searches in PTA data. The model is accurate up to the second post-Newtonian (2PN) order for the conservative dynamics and up to post-leading order for the radiation-reaction terms. We provide both a numerically precise and a computationally efficient approximate implementation and evaluate the latter's accuracy against the full model over a broad range of eccentricities and initial orbital frequencies. Our results show that a substantial region of the parameter space exhibits pronounced orbital evolution, much stronger than in the circular case. We demonstrate the rich harmonic structure of timing residuals induced by eccentric GWs. Properly characterising eccentric binaries is an essential step toward detecting GWs in PTA data and interpreting the results, ultimately improving our understanding of the supermassive black hole population in the local Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of neutron stars and the precise measurement of their macroscopic properties have provided valuable insights into fundamental physics, both by constraining the behavior of nuclear matter under extreme conditions and by enabling tests of general relativity in the strong-field regime. In this context, equation-of-state-insensitive or ``quasi-universal'' relations between key observables, such as the compactness, dimensionless static tidal deformability, and moment of inertia, play a crucial role in connecting different measurable observables while minimizing uncertainties due to the yet unknown equation of state. In this work, we identify new quasi-universal relations between the static, dimensionless tidal deformability ($\Lambda^{(0)}$) and its leading-order dynamical correction ($\Lambda^{(2)}$), as well as a combination of these parameters ($\sqrt{\Lambda^{(0)}/\Lambda^{(2)}} \equiv M\omega_*$), obtained from the small-frequency expansion of the relativistic tidal response. We test these relations across a representative set of 63 equations of state, finding that the equation-of-state dependence does not exceed $\sim 5\%$ for the $\Lambda^{(0)}$-$\Lambda^{(2)}$ relation and $\sim 2.5\%$ for the $\Lambda^{(0)}$-$M\omega_*$ relation. This indicates a high degree of universality and offers a simplified framework for incorporating dynamical tidal effects into gravitational-wave modeling. Furthermore, we compare the fully dynamical tidal response against different recent strategies (a Taylor expansion and an effective-one-mode approximation) to model the dynamical tide. We find that both models are capable of capturing the frequency-dependent behavior of the fully dynamical tidal deformability, with the Taylor expansion outperforming the effective-one-mode approximation in most of the parameter space.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope has recently detected massive, fully formed, galaxies at redshifts corresponding to few hundred million years after the Big-Bang. However, our current cosmological model cannot produce such massive systems so early in the lifetime of the universe. A number of theoretical solutions have been proposed, but they all appeal to exotic new physics and introduce rather excessive fine-tuning. In this essay, we outline a theoretical answer to the early galaxy-formation question, which operates within standard general relativity and standard cosmology, without appealing to any new physics. Instead, we account for the effect of a well established feature of our universe. This feature, which has so far been kept in the margins of mainstream cosmology, are the peculiar velocities.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents exact solutions of the Kemmer equation for spin-1 particles in $(1+1)$-dimensional Rindler spacetime, motivated by the need to understand vector bosons under uniform acceleration, including non-inertial effects and the Unruh temperature, which distinguish them from spin-0 and spin-1/2 systems. Starting from the free Kemmer field in an accelerated reference frame, we establish eigenvalue equations resembling those of the Klein--Gordon equation in Rindler coordinates. By introducing the Dirac oscillator interaction through a momentum substitution, we derive an exact closed-form spectrum for the Kemmer oscillator, revealing how the acceleration parameter modifies the characteristic length, shifts the discrete energy spectrum, and lifts degeneracies. In the Minkowski limit $a\to 0$, the standard Kemmer oscillator spectrum is recovered, ensuring consistency with flat-spacetime results. These findings provide a tractable framework for analyzing acceleration-induced effects, with implications for quantum field theory in curved spacetime, quantum gravity, and analogue gravity platforms.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a search for gravitational waves from inspiraling, planetary-mass ultra-compact binaries using data from the first part of the fourth observing run of LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA. Finding no evidence of such systems, we determine the maximum distance reach for such objects and their merger rate densities, independently of how they could have formed. Then, we identify classes of primordial black-hole mass distributions for which these rate limits can be translated into relevant constraints on the mass distribution of primordial black holes, assuming that they compose all of dark matter, in the mass range $[10^{-6},10^{-3}]M_\odot$. Our constraints are consistent with existing microlensing results in the planetary-mass range, and provide a complementary probe to sub-solar mass objects.

 - **Abstract**
 Einstein-Kalb-Ramond gravity is an alternative theory of gravity in which a rank-two antisymmetric tensor field, known as the Kalb-Ramond field, is nonminimally coupled to gravity and can induce spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking when it acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value. In this work, we revisit Einstein-Kalb-Ramond gravity and obtain two classes of exact static black hole solutions with general topological horizons in diverse dimensions within this framework, both with and without a cosmological constant. We further analyze their thermodynamic properties and employ the Wald formalism to compute the Noether mass and entropy, thereby establishing the corresponding first law of black hole thermodynamics. Finally, we discuss the implications of the Noether mass charge for constraining spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking within the framework of Einstein-Kalb-Ramond gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 By deriving and solving the gravitational and electromagnetic field equations in $f(R,T)$ gravity coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics, we obtain a static spherically symmetric charged solution that incorporates higher-order correction terms along with an effective cosmological constant term. This solution reduces to the AdS/dS metric in the far-field region while exhibiting significant modifications in the strong-field regime due to the nonlinear electromagnetic effects and the matter-geometry coupling. We further analyze the black hole's horizon structure, revealing the complex phenomenon of multiple horizons emerging within specific parameter ranges. Additionally, by introducing an effective metric to study photon propagation, we systematically explore the influence of magnetic charge and the coupling parameter on the effective potential, the photon sphere radius, and the black hole shadow.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of gravitational waves (GWs) generated by binary black hole (BBH) mergers provide us with a powerful way to explore the strong and highly dynamical regime of gravity theories. The ringdown of BBH merger, consisting of a series of quasi-normal modes (QNMs), is of particular interest for both the black hole (BH) spectroscopy and the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency check. Unlike the QNM frequencies that only depend on the properties of the remnant BH, the excitation amplitudes and phases of QNMs depend on the progenitor system, and calculating them is beyond the perturbative approach. In this paper, by performing self-consistent fully non-linear simulations of BBH merger in shift-symmetric scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity as well as in sGB gravity allowing for scalarization, and extracting the QNM excitation, we explore the possible deviations from GR at the ringdown stage. We numerically verify that the mode frequencies are consistent with the theory prediction, and provide the fitting results of mode amplitudes and phases. We find relatively small changes in the mode excitation, considering that the largest coupling we used in the simulations is close to the limit of loss of hyperbolicity. To demonstrate that our results are robust against the eccentricity caused by the imperfect initial data, we also perform eccentricity reduction and estimate the effect caused by the initial eccentricity. These studies are useful for understanding the ringdown in sGB gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 The status of a modification of General Relativity (GR) -- Spontaneously Broken Relativity (SBR) -- for merging gravity, dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) is presented. The modification is principally grounded on a multiscalar-metric concept of spacetime endowed with two dynamical structures: a basic metric and a set of the reversible multiscalar fields. The latter ones serve geometrically as exceptional dynamical coordinates among arbitrary kinematical/observer's ones and physically as a kind of gravitational Higgs fields producing possible spontaneous breaking of the symmetry (SSB) of relativity. The effective field theory (EFT) of the extended gravity based on the multiscalar-metric spacetime -- the metagravity -- is discussed and some of its particular realizations beyond GR as SBR are explicated. Physically, SBR results in appearance of massive tensor and scalar gravitons. Some of the emerging consequences, problems and prospects for SBR for future deeper unification of gravity with matter in the context of the relativity and internal symmetries breaking are shortly discussed.

#### Canonical form of a deformed Poisson bracket spacetime

 - **Abstract**
 The general uncertainty principle applied to gravity can be implemented as a set of modified Poisson brackets in the canonical formalism. As such, the theory is not canonical and the resulting equations of motion, diffeomorphism constraint, and Hamiltonian constraint are unlikely to lead to a covariant metric. We construct a Hamiltonian that when applying the usual canonical formalism gives a closed algebra and equations of motion that result in the original metric obtained by using distorted Poisson brackets. The resulting theory is thus rendered canonical and covariant. We then covariantly couple scalar matter and dust to the modified gravity to allow the study of dynamics.

#### The Globally Trapped Future: A Fate for Black Holes and Wormholes

 - **Abstract**
 A new general dynamical metric is obtained through a generalization of the Schwarzschild foundations, explicitly providing the global causal structure and trapping horizons and establishing three possible fates of the spacetime: those without a globally trapped future; those without global trapping but containing bounded, Cauchy-foliated trapped regions; and those with a future that becomes completely globally trapped. This framework is illustrated through the evolution of a geometrically Schwarzschild-like black hole and a horizonless wormhole, thereby establishing the final, globally trapped fate as a novel theoretical possibility.

#### Gravitational collapse in the vicinity of the extremal black hole critical point

 - **Abstract**
 We study the threshold of gravitational collapse in spherically symmetric spacetimes governed by the Einstein-Maxwell-Vlasov equations. We numerically construct solutions describing a collapsing distribution of charged matter that either forms a charged black hole or eventually disperses. We first consider a region of parameter space where the solutions at the threshold of black hole formation are stationary, horizonless shells. These solutions terminate at a critical point, with their charge-to-mass ratio approaching unity from below, and the instability timescale diverging. Beyond the critical point, we find a new region of parameter space where the threshold solution is an extremal black hole. We measure the scaling of the dynamical time period of the near threshold solutions and discuss how they are connected in the two regimes. If a similar picture to the one found here holds for known families of stationary solutions of rotating matter that approach the exterior of an extremal Kerr spacetime, they could provide a route to forming an extremal spinning black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 We aim to analyze the consistency of the deformation of the Heisenberg algebra in the setting of constrained Hamiltonian systems, providing a procedure to induce the deformation on the Poisson algebra after symplectic reduction. We investigate this in the context of the classical interpretation of Generalized Uncertainty Principle theories, treating two cases separately. For the first case, we consider a group action on the phase space together with a set of first-class constraints that can be interpreted as a momentum map. We furnish an explicit example in the case of rotational invariant deformed algebras. In the second case, we consider a single constraint provided by the Hamiltonian, which is a common instance in General Relativity, with straightforward application in cosmology.

#### Fibre Inflation Meets Quintessence: Implications of Perturbative Stabilisation

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we have discovered a new avenue of fibre inflation in perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS) due to the redefinition of the base modulus. pLVS offers a novel regime where large volume of the internal space is guaranteed without the need of non-perturbative effects. In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data \cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim} and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\lesssim r\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $\alpha^{\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier.

#### Renormalization of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet AdS gravity

 - **Abstract**
 The asymptotic analysis for the metric of a generic solution of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet AdS theory is provided by solving the field equations in the Fefferman-Graham frame. Using standard holographic renormalization, the counterterms that render the action finite are found up to seven spacetime dimensions. In the case of 6D, an equivalent formulation that permits a fully covariant determination of the counterterms is introduced, based on the finiteness of conformal invariants. It is shown that both schemes end up in the same holographic stress-energy tensor. Physical properties of six-dimensional topological Boulware-Deser black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-AdS$_6$ gravity, whose boundary has nontrivial conformal features, are worked out in detail. Employing both renormalization prescriptions, finite asymptotic charges are found, and the correct black hole thermodynamics is recovered.
