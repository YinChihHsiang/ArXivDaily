#### Foiling Black Hole Foils: Revealing Horizon Alternatives with Baryonic Atmospheres

 - **Abstract**
 Event horizons are a defining feature of black holes. Consequently, there have been many efforts to probe their existence in astrophysical black hole candidates, spanning ten orders of magnitude in mass. Nevertheless, horizons remain an obstacle to unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, most sharply presented by the information paradox. This has motivated a proliferation of horizonless alternatives (black hole foils) that avoid event horizons and are therefore benign. We show that for typical accreting astronomical targets, largely independent of a foil's underlying microphysics, a horizonless compact surface will generically be ensconced within an optically thick, scattering dominated baryonic settling layer that efficiently reprocesses the kinetic energy of infalling matter into observable thermal emission. The emergent photosphere luminosity is driven toward the accretion-powered equilibrium value and is only weakly sensitive to the foil redshift. These atmospheres are convectively stable and naturally imply that the emitting photosphere forms at modest redshift even when the surface redshift is extreme. Moreover, local gas-surface interaction provides a microphysical lower bound on the effective base temperature, insulating the atmosphere from arbitrarily cold foils. The unknown properties of the foil enter only through local boundary conditions controlling baryon processing and thermal coupling at the surface, making the solutions broadly applicable to horizonless alternatives that do not invoke significant additional nonlocal interactions. Thus, under minimal assumptions (GR exterior and local surface interactions), horizonless foils are generically observationally exposed: the absence of a thermal photosphere directly constrains or rules out broad classes of such models.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black hole growth plausibly occurs via runaway astrophysical black hole mergers in nuclear star clusters that form intermediate mass black hole seeds at high redshifts. Such a model of Little Red Dots yields an order-of-magnitude higher rate of tidal disruption events than that of black hole captures. Our prediction, normalised to our proposed resolution of SMBH seeding, yields detectable TDE rates at high redshift. The resulting dense gas cocoons generate the nuclei of LRDs, each incorporating a central massive black-hole-star, with comparable masses in gas, stars, and massive black hole within a scale of around a parsec as inferred from the various spectral signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 Little Red Dots (LRDs), among the most enigmatic high-redshift discoveries by JWST, are commonly believed to be powered by accreting supermassive black holes. Here, we explore the possibility that these sources are globular clusters in formation, with rest-frame UV arising from a very young stellar population and rest-frame optical from a short-lived supermassive ($>10^4$ M$_\odot$) star. The spectral profiles of LRDs are broadly consistent with this scenario, though the observed temperatures and bolometric luminosities favor emission reprocessed by optically thick, continuum-driven winds not fully captured by current models. The LRD $z\sim5-7$ UV luminosity function naturally evolves, under standard evolutionary and mass-loss prescriptions, into a present-day mass function with a turnover at $\log_{10}(M_\ast$/$M_\odot)=5.3$ and an exponential cutoff at high masses, consistent with local globular-cluster populations. We estimate the total present-day number density of LRDs formed across all redshifts to be $\approx0.3$ Mpc$^{-3}$, similar to local globular clusters. The observed LRD redshift range matches the age distribution of metal-poor globular clusters, without current LRD counterparts to the metal-rich population. If LRDs are globular clusters in formation, we predict chemical abundance patterns characteristic of multiple stellar populations, including enhanced He and N, and potential Na-O and Al-Mg anti-correlations. These results offer a local perspective to explore this surprisingly abundant population of distant sources, and a potential new window into extreme stellar astrophysics in the early Universe.

#### Implications of the nanoHertz Gravitational-Wave Background for Galactic Feedback and Massive Black Hole Growth

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15938

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements of the nanoHertz gravitational-wave background (GWB) can constrain models for the growth history of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and how active galactic nucleus (AGN) and stellar feedback models can affect GWB predictions. Feedback regulates supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth, altering the black hole mass function (BHMF). Using BHMFs drawn from multiple cosmological simulation suites including IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG, Simba, and CAMELS, and combining these with a quasar-based SMBH binary population framework, we predict the resulting GWB amplitude under a range of different stellar and AGN feedback prescriptions. We find that the choice of both stellar and AGN feedback models alters the high-mass end of the BHMF and changes the predicted GWB amplitude by up to a factor of 2 for the fiducial simulations and a factor 10 for extreme feedback variations in CAMELS. Models with inefficient or absent AGN feedback produce abundant SMBHs and yield GWB amplitudes consistent with PTA data, yet fail in producing realistic galaxies. Fiducial models of AGN and stellar feedback suppress SMBH growth too much and under-predict the expected signal, an effect which could possibly be mitigated by more realistic black hole seeding and growth prescriptions. The mismatch between the GWB amplitudes predicted by cosmological simulations and those observed by PTAs suggests that SMBH growth is more efficient or occurs earlier than captured by current models. This demonstrates that PTA measurements provide a powerful new probe of feedback physics and the SMBH population.

#### Gas Accretion versus BH Merger driven Growth Modes of Supermassive Black Holes and Implications for the Little Red Dots

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15952

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the growth of central supermassive black holes in galaxies, aiming to distinguish between gas accretion versus BH merger-driven growth modes. By performing and analysing cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of $(50 ~ {\rm Mpc})^3$ comoving boxes, we also study how the BH feedback parameters affect the coevolution between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Starting as $10^5 M_{\odot}$ seeds, we find that the BHs grow initially via BH mergers to $\sim 10^7 M_{\odot}$. Gas accretion onto the BHs is initially low, then increases with time, and reaches the Eddington rate after $7-9$ Gyrs. The BHs then undergo very fast growth via efficient gas accretion over a period of $600 - 700$ Myr, when the BH mass increases $10^2 - 10^3$ times, causing their predominant growth from $10^7 M_{\odot}$ to $(10^9 - 10^{10}) M_{\odot}$. Taking into account the cosmological gas inflows and outflows, SMBHs do not grow to more than $10^{10} M_{\odot}$ by $z=0$, because of gas depletion from galaxy centers driven by AGN feedback. In terms of SMBH - host galaxy coevolution along the $M_{\rm BH} - M_{\star}$ relation, we find that they initially lie below and thereby move upward toward the relation. We make some physical implications of the growth of high-$z$ Little Red Dots recently observed by JWST: the normal-mass SMBHs had predominantly undergone BH merger driven evolution, whereas the overmassive BHs underwent periods of Eddington-limited or super-Eddington bursts of gas accretion.

#### Is the overconcentration of pristine populations in Galactic globular clusters real? An N-body approach to the problem

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations indicate that in some Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) pristine red giant branch (RGB) stars appear more centrally concentrated than enriched ones. This contradicts most multiple stellar population (MSP) formation scenarios, which predict that the enriched (second) population (2P) should initially be more concentrated than the pristine (first) population (1P). Previous MOCCA Monte Carlo simulations suggested that this apparent overconcentration is a transient effect arising in clusters that have lost a large fraction of their initial mass and host an active black hole subsystem (BHS), and is visible only when RGB stars are used as tracers. In this letter, we test this interpretation using tailored NBODY6++GPU models evolved with direct N-body simulations, providing an independent validation that does not rely on a statistical treatment of relaxation. We performed direct N-body simulations with the NBODY6++GPU code, adopting initial conditions designed to reproduce the dynamical regime relevant to the proposed mechanism. The simulations include updated stellar and binary evolution, dynamical interactions, and the Galactic tidal field, enabling a direct comparison with MOCCA results. The simulations confirm that the spatial distributions and kinematics inferred from RGB stars can be strongly affected by stochastic fluctuations and interactions with the BHS. Preferential ejection of 2P RGB and their progenitors from the cluster center leads to a transient apparent overconcentration of 1P RGB stars, in agreement with earlier MOCCA predictions.

#### Stellar microlensing as a probe of Primordial Black Holes: status and prospects

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar microlensing is a powerful tool for probing dark matter in the form of planetary and stellar mass compact objects (COs), in particular primordial black holes (PBHs). Under standard assumptions, current observations exclude COs in the mass range $10^{-11} \lesssim M/M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{4}$ making up all of the dark matter. We provide an overview, aimed at theorists working on PBHs, of the history, theory, observational status, and future prospects of the field.

#### Effects of Symmetron on growth and RSD multipoles

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16107

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the effects of the growth rate scale dependence in the Symmetron modified gravity (MG) model on cosmic structure formation and we analyze the redshift-space distortion (RSD) multipoles, comparing with the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model (specifically the F6) and the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The analysis employs a scale-dependent growth equation and utilizes the fk-PT perturbation theory approach, implemented in the FOLPS-nu code, to compute the full 1-loop power spectrum multipoles, in particular, the monopole and quadrupole ($\ell=0,2$, respectively). The results show that at redshift $z=0$, the monopole of both MG models is suppressed compared to $\Lambda$CDM, with the Symmetron being closer to the standard model, while the quadrupole presents the opposite behavior. To validate the pipeline, we use General Relativity (GR) mock catalogs (EZMocks), since suitable Symmetron simulations are not available. The main result is that the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis successfully recovers the expected GR limit (i.e., $\beta_0 \approx 0$) from the Symmetron model when applied to this mock data, confirming the viability of our methodology for cosmological inference. Then, we conclude that the pipeline is prepared to test MG models against current and near-future galaxy surveys.

#### Cosmic Hysteresis in Reconstructed $f(T)$ Bounce Models A Torsion-Based Thermodynamic Perspective

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the emergence of cosmic hysteresis in cyclic and bouncing cosmologies within the framework of reconstructed $f(T)$ gravity. In contrast to curvature-based modifications of General Relativity, teleparallel gravity attributes gravitation to spacetime torsion encoded in the torsion scalar $T$. By reconstructing viable $f(T)$ functions corresponding to analytically prescribed nonsingular bouncing scale factors and coupling the geometry to a minimally interacting canonical scalar field, we demonstrate that asymmetric scalar field dynamics between expansion and contraction phases give rise to a non-vanishing thermodynamic work integral $\oint p_\phi \, dV$ over complete cycles. This hysteresis manifests as closed loops in the $(w_\phi,a)$ plane, signifying thermodynamic memory and irreversibility. We derive the modified Friedmann equations, establish exact bounce and turnaround conditions, and discuss the implications of torsion-induced hysteresis for the cosmological arrow of time. Our results confirm that cosmic hysteresis is a generic feature of cyclic universes in modified gravity, extending beyond curvature-based theories.

#### A Brief Review of Wormhole Cosmic Censorship

 - **Abstract**
 Spacetime singularities, in the sense that curvature invariants are infinite at some point or region, are thought to be impossible to observe, and must be hidden within an event horizon. This conjecture is called Cosmic Censorship (CC), and was formulated by Penrose. Here we review another type of CC where spacetime singularities are causally disconnected from the universe, because the throat of a wormhole ``sucks in'' the geodesics and prevents them from making contact with the singularity. In this work, we present a series of exact solutions to the Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton equations that feature a ring singularity; that is, the curvature invariants are singular in this ring, but the ring is causally disconnected from the universe so that no geodesics can touch it. This extension of CC is called Wormhole Cosmic Censorship.

#### Rotating Black Holes with Primary Scalar Hair: Shadow Signatures in Beyond Horndeski Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) image of M87* provides a direct test of strong-field gravity, measuring an angular shadow diameter $\theta_d = 42 \pm 3~\mu\mathrm{as}$ and a circularity deviation $\Delta C \leq 0.1$. Such observations allow quantitative tests of the Kerr paradigm and of possible deviations from the no-hair theorem. In scalar-tensor extensions of gravity, black holes may possess primary scalar hair, introducing an additional independent parameter beyond mass and spin. In this work, we construct rotating black hole solutions with primary scalar hair in beyond Horndeski gravity and analyze their photon regions and shadow formation. We show that the scalar hair parameter $Q$ induces characteristic modifications of the shadow, and in particular negative $Q$ enlarges the shadow and reduces its oblateness, while positive $Q$ shrinks and enhances its distortion. Modeling M87* within this framework and imposing the EHT bounds on $\theta_d$ and $\Delta C$, we determine the viable $(a,Q)$ parameter space. We find that current observations do not exclude rotating black holes with primary scalar hair, although the allowed region is significantly restricted for $Q>0$. Finally, the scalar-hair-induced deviations are of order $\mathcal{O}(\mu\mathrm{as})$, placing them near the sensitivity threshold of present instruments and within reach of next-generation horizon-scale imaging.

 - **Abstract**
 A transient violation of the null energy condition (NEC) during inflation provides a novel mechanism for producing primordial black holes (PBHs) and stochastic gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds. In this work, we extend previous studies by computing the GW contributions from both the ringdown phase of PBH formation and subsequent binary mergers. Our results show that this scenario produces a rich, multi-component GW spectrum consisting of primordial GWs, scalar-induced GWs, and GW emissions from PBH ringdown and binary mergers. We demonstrate that these correlated signatures across different frequency bands provide a novel and powerful avenue to probe or constrain NEC violation during inflation through future multi-band GW observations.

#### The Penrose-Rindler equation and horizon thermodynamics of stationary black holes

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes are the natural arena for exploring the interplay between gravity and thermodynamics. Although the association between black hole mechanics and black hole thermodynamics is well-established, the comprehensive geometric formulation of thermodynamic variables deserves further investigation. In this work, both Newman-Penrose (NP) and Geroch-Held-Penrose (GHP) formalisms are considered within the framework of horizon thermodynamics. We show that the NP formalism reformulates the horizon condition as the Penrose-Rindler equation. In this context, a Smarr-like formula for stationary black holes is recovered from the Penrose-Rindler equation reinterpreted as a horizon equilibrium of pressures, which includes a pressure associated with the horizon rotation. A complete geometric reformulation of this reinterpretation of the Penrose-Rindler equation evaluated at the horizon is developed within the GHP formalism. The GHP approach further inspires the introduction of the horizon-averaged matter pressure and its conjugate volume, thereby enabling a quasi-local realization of the Smarr-like formula for stationary black holes. This geometric formulation clarifies the connection between horizon dynamics and thermodynamics and offers a unified setting for extending black hole thermodynamics beyond spherical symmetry.

#### Testing non-circular black hole spacetime with X-ray reflection

 - **Abstract**
 X-ray reflection spectroscopy is a powerful tool for testing the Kerr hypothesis and probing the strong gravity regime around accreting black holes. Most tests of General Relativity (GR) assume that the spacetime around a black hole is circular, meaning the metric possesses a specific symmetry structure common to the Kerr solution. However, deviations from circularity are predicted by various modified gravity theories and non-vacuum General Relativity solutions. In this work, we test a specific non-circular metric constructed based on a locality principle, where the deviation from the Kerr spacetime is driven by the local spacetime curvature. To accurately model the reflection spectrum in this background, we implement a relativistic ray-tracing code in horizon-penetrating (ingoing Kerr) coordinates, which are favored for their ability to avoid introducing curvature singularities at the horizon in non-circular spacetimes. We apply this model to the high-quality \textit{NuSTAR} spectrum of the Galactic black hole binary EXO 1846--031. Our spectral analysis reveals a source with a high inclination angle ($\iota \approx 76^{\circ}$) and a near-extremal spin parameter ($a_* \approx 0.98$). While we identify a global minimum in the parameter space suggesting a non-zero deformation ($\ell_{\mathrm{NP}} \approx 0.12$), the 99\% confidence interval fully encompasses the Kerr limit ($\ell_{\mathrm{NP}}=0$). We conclude that the current X-ray reflection data for EXO 1846--031 are consistent with the Kerr hypothesis. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using X-ray reflection spectroscopy to constrain non-circular metrics and establishes a framework for future tests.

#### Multi-centered Myers-Perry Black Holes in Five Dimensions

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new family of multi-centered rotating black hole solutions in 5D vacuum Einstein gravity, providing explicit examples of cohomogeneity-three spacetimes. It is well known that, in the presence of two commuting Killing vector fields, the theory reduces to 3D gravity coupled to an $SL(3,\mathbb{R})$ nonlinear sigma model with five scalar fields. We show that the scalar fields of the extremal Myers-Perry solution can be expressed in terms of two harmonic functions on 3D flat space, and that promoting these functions to include multiple sources yields explicit multi-centered extremal Myers-Perry black holes located at arbitrary positions. Each center forms a smooth $S^3$ Killing horizon, provided that the rotation parameters satisfy $|j_i|<1/2$. We further demonstrate that all curvature singularities are hidden behind the horizons and that no closed timelike curves arise on or outside the horizons. The solutions are asymptotically locally Minkowski in the sense that constant-time hypersurfaces are asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE). As a concrete example, we consider a binary configuration, examine its rod structure, and demonstrate the absence of conical singularities between the two black holes, indicating that they are supported by an intermediate bubble region separating them.
