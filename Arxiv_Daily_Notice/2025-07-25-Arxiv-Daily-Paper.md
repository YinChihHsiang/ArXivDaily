#### Recurrent Cometary Activity Discovered on Quasi-Hilda Jupiter Family Comet 362P/(457175) 2008 GO98

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of recurrent activity on quasi-Hilda comet (QHC) 362P/(457175) 2008 GO98. The first activity epoch was discovered during the perihelion passage of 362P. The first activity epoch was discovered during the perihelion in 2016 (Garcia-Migani & Gil-Hutton 2018), so we were motivated to observe it for recurrent cometary activity near its next perihelion passage (UT 2024 July 20). We obtained observations with the Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT), the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) telescope, and the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT) and identified a second activity epoch when 362P had a true anomaly (v) as early as 318.1 deg. We conducted archival searches of numerous repositories and identified images obtained with Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) MegaCam, Dark Energy Camera (DECam), Pan-STARRS 1, SkyMapper, Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT) network data. Using these data, we identified activity from a previously unreported timespan, and we did not detect activity when 362P was away from perihelion, specifically 83 deg < v < 318 deg. Detection of activity near perihelion and absence of activity away from perihelion suggest thermally-driven activity and volatile sublimation. Our dynamical simulations suggest 362P is a QHC and it will remain in a combined Jupiter-family comet (JFC) and quasi-Hilda orbit over the next 1 kyr, though it will become increasingly chaotic nearing the end of this timeframe. Our backward simulations suggest 362P may have migrated from the orbit of a Long Period Comet (~53%) or Centaur (~32%), otherwise it remained a JFC (~15%) over the previous 100 kyr. We recommend additional telescope observations from the community as 362P continues outbound from its perihelion on UT 2024 July 20, as well as continued observations for a third activity epoch.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic strings appear in many well-motivated extensions to the standard model of particle physics. If they exist, an abundant population of compact objects known as cosmic string loops permeate the Universe at all times, providing a secondary source of density perturbations that are large amplitude and non-gaussian in nature. In general, these loops are not stationary in the rest frame of the dark matter, thus their relative velocities will typically seed both spherical and filamentary overdensities in the matter era. Building upon previous work, we provide an improved framework to compute the complete halo mass function for these string seeded overdensities, valid for any loop velocity distribution. Using this mass function, we also compute the subset of halos capable of undergoing a direct collapse, forming a population of black holes with initial mass $10^{4-5} \, M_{\odot}$ at high redshifts. Interestingly, for reasonable values of the string parameters, one can reproduce the abundance of ``Little Red Dots" as inferred by JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from accretion disks formed during the failed collapse of a rotating massive star (a collapsar). Following black hole formation, a neutrino-cooled, shocked accretion disk forms, which displays non-spherical oscillations for a period of seconds before becoming advective and exploding the star. We compute the neutrino and GW signals (matter quadrupole) from collapsar disks using global axisymmetric, viscous hydrodynamic simulations. The neutrino signal with typical energies of O$(10)$ MeV is maximal during the neutrino-cooled (NDAF) phase that follows shock formation. This phase lasts for a few seconds and is easily detectable within O$(10-100)$ kpc by the IceCube Neutrino Telescope. Additional neutrino signatures from a precursor equatorial shock and by stochastic accretion plumes during the advective phase are detectable within the galaxy. The GW signal during the NDAF phase is detectable in the galaxy by current and next-generation ground-based observatories. The explosion (memory) GW signal is similar to that of standard core-collapse supernovae and can be probed with a deci-Hertz space-based detector. Shock oscillations during the NDAF phase impart time variations with frequency O$(10-100)$ Hz to the neutrino and GW signals, encoding information about the shock dynamics and inner disk. These time variations can be detectable in neutrinos by IceCube within O$(1-10)$ kpc depending on progenitor model, flavor transformation scenario, and detailed properties of the angular momentum transport mechanism.

 - **Abstract**
 Discrepancies between distance measurements and $\Lambda$CDM predictions reveal notable features in the distance-redshift relation, possibly suggesting the presence of an evolving dark energy component. Given the central role of the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in modeling cosmological distances, we investigate here whether these features instead point to a possible departure from the fundamental FLRW symmetries. Exploiting the transverse and line-of-sight distances provided by baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) observations, we demonstrate that observed distances hint at a slight but systematic preference for an anisotropic expansion rate emerging regardless of the dark energy model considered. Leveraging this non-FLRW feature, we investigate an inhomogeneous extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model that naturally provides an anisotropic expansion rate. Our analysis demonstrates that models featuring spherical overdensities can explain BAO, supernova, and cosmic microwave background data, providing fits statistically indistinguishable from those obtained with a phantom dark energy scenario. When Pantheon+ data is considered, our analysis challenges the FLRW framework at $2.8\sigma$ and yields scenarios that can be interpreted as subtle but non-negligible deviations from the FLRW metric. When DESY5 supernovae are considered instead, deviations are notably more significant, yielding scenarios that mildly violate the Copernican principle and exclude the FLRW assumption at $5.2\sigma$. Overall, our results motivate a more in-depth investigation of whether the perfectly homogeneous and isotropic FLRW paradigm can still be assumed to accurately predict cosmological distances in the era of precision cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Determining cosmological parameters with high precision, as well as resolving current tensions in their values derived from low and high redshift probes, is one of the main objectives of the new generation of cosmological surveys. The combination of complementary probes in terms of parameter degeneracies and systematics is key to achieving these ambitious scientific goals. In this context, determining the optimal survey configuration for an analysis that combines galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing, the so-called 3x2pt analysis, remains an open problem. In this paper, we present an efficient and flexible end-to-end pipeline to optimise the sample selection for 3x2pt analyses in an automated way. Our pipeline is articulated in two main steps: we first consider a self-organising map to determine the photometric redshifts of a simulated galaxy sample. As a proof of method for stage-IV surveys, we use samples from the DESC Data Challenge 2 catalogue. This allows us to classify galaxies into tomographic bins based on their colour phenotype clustering. We then explore different redshift-bin edge configurations for weak lensing only as well as 3x2pt analyses in a novel way. Our method explores multiple configurations of perturbed redshift-bin edges with respect to the fiducial case in an iterative manner. In particular, we sample tomographic configurations for the source and lens galaxies separately. We show that, using this method we quickly converge into an optimised configuration for different numbers of redshift bins and cosmologies. Our analysis demonstrates that for stage-IV surveys an optimal tomographic sample selection can increase the figure of merit of the dark energy (DE) equation of state by a factor of $\sim$2, comparable to an effective increase in survey area of $\sim$4 for non-optimal photometric survey analyses.

#### Hyperonic degrees of freedom in binary neutron star mergers

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the influence of hyperons in binary neutron star mergers considering several different equations of state that include hyperons. By running a large set of simulations, we study the impact of the thermally produced hyperons on the gravitational-wave spectral features, the temperature evolution of the remnant, the mass ejecta and the threshold mass for prompt collapse to a black hole. Models with hyperons tend to stand out in the relation between the dominant postmerger gravitational-wave frequency and the tidal deformability of massive stars. Moreover, the averaged temperature of the remnant is reduced for hyperonic models. The mass ejection of the mergers is tentatively enhanced when hyperons are present in comparison to nucleonic EoSs leading to similar stellar properties of cold neutron stars, whereas the threshold mass for prompt black-hole formation is reduced by about 0.05~$M_\odot$ compared to the nucleonic models.

#### Phantom crossing or dark interaction?

 - **Abstract**
 Recent results from DESI BAO measurements, together with Planck CMB and Pantheon+ data, suggest that there may be a `phantom' phase ($w_{\rm de}<-1$) in the expansion of the Universe. This inference follows when the $w_0, w_a$ parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$ is used to fit the data. Since phantom dark energy in general relativity is unphysical, we investigate the possibility that the phantom behaviour is not intrinsic, but effective -- due to a non-gravitational interaction between dark matter and non-phantom dark energy. To this end, we assume a physically motivated thawing quintessence-like form of the intrinsic dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm de}$. Then we use a $w_0, w_a$ model for the \emph{effective} equation of state of dark energy. We find that the data favours a phantom crossing for the effective dark energy, but only at low significance. The intrinsic equation of state of dark energy is non-phantom, without imposing any non-phantom priors. A nonzero interaction is favoured at more than $3\sigma$ at $z\sim0.3$. The energy flows from dark matter to dark energy at early times and reverses at later times.

#### Variable QPO lags and reduced coherence between the disc and corona in MAXI J1820+070

 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are observed in the hard state of many black hole X-ray binaries. Although their origin is unknown, they are strongly associated with the corona, of which the geometry is also subject to discussion. We present a thorough spectral-timing analysis of QPOs and broadband noise in the high-inclination BHXRB MAXI J1820+070, using the rich NICER data set of the source in the bright hard state of its outburst in 2018. We find that there is a large QPO hard lag between soft energy bands with significant disc emission and harder coronal power-law bands, which is absent when measuring lags between energy bands dominated by the coronal emission. The QPO lags between a soft band (with significant disc emission) and harder coronal power-law bands vary significantly with power-law flux, on time-scales of (tens of) seconds or a few QPO cycles, especially at QPO frequencies $\lesssim0.3$ Hz. At the same time, the QPO is found to be related to a decreased coherence between energy bands with significant disc emission and harder bands both at and below the QPO frequency, suggesting the QPO mechanism filters out part of the variability. Similar patterns in the frequency-dependent lags and coherence are observed in the BHXRB MAXI J1803-298, which is a (dipping) high-inclination source, but not in the low-inclination source GX 339-4. We suggest that these findings may be evidence of changes in the vertical extent of the corona on time-scales slightly longer than the QPO cycle.

 - **Abstract**
 The Effective Field Theory (EFT) of Dark Energy (DE) is a model independent framework that allows for the description of a wide class of dark energy and modified gravity models. This is achieved by extending the Hilbert Einstein action through the introduction of time dependent functions. However, the choice of these functions and thus the operator basis is not unique. In this paper, we propose a physically motivated constraint based on the continuity equation, leading to a continuity equation compatible (CEC) basis that ensures a clear physical interpretation of the background EFT operators.

 - **Abstract**
 Chapter1 introduces cosmic acceleration and outlines key features and limitations of GR and its alternatives, including teleparallel and symmetric teleparallel gravity. In Chapter2, we analyze the cosmological implications of $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ theory by considering the squared-torsion model $f(T,\mathcal{T})= \alpha \mathcal{T}+ \beta T^2$, where $T$ represents torsion and $\mathcal{T}$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. In Chapter3, we explore the inflationary scenario within the framework of torsion-trace coupling gravity, utilizing a Lagrangian density derived from a function denoted as $f(T,\mathcal{T})$. In Chapter4, we aim to investigate the dark sector of the Universe, which encompasses the enigmatic components of the Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE). We consider an extended form of the Equation of State (EoS) for DM, widely known as the Extended Bose-Einstein Condensation (EBEC) EoS for DM. In Chapter5, we propose an extended formulation of symmetric teleparallel gravity by generalizing the gravitational Lagrangian through the inclusion of an arbitrary function of $f(Q,\mathcal{T_{\mu\nu}} \mathcal{T^{\mu\nu}})$. We derived the FRW equations for a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic spacetime. In Chapter6, we delved into the dark sector of the Universe, specifically focusing on DM and DE. We examine an extended version of the EoS for DM, commonly referred to EBEC EoS for DM, given as $p=\alpha \rho + \beta \rho^2$, alongside the modified $f(Q)$ Lagrangian given by $f(Q)= \gamma Q^2$.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose new bounds on black hole entropy in terms of the specific heat at fixed charges. For special spherically-symmetric and static black holes ($g_{tt} g_{rr}=-1$), we prove the bounds with suitable sufficient energy conditions. For more general static and rotating black holes, we test the bounds with a variety of examples. This work extends the previously-known algebraic inequalities of the black hole thermodynamic variables such as the Penrose inequality, to include their derivatives.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary pulsars offer a unique natural laboratory to test General Relativity (GR) and probe for deviations from its paradigm, as predicted by alternative theories of gravity. In this paper, we study two such possible deviations: a time variation of Newton's constant $G$ and the emission of dipolar gravitational radiation. We use updated data for some well-known pulsars, namely PSR J1738+0333, PSR J1012+5307, and PSR J1713+0747, to extract the Keplerian and post-Keplerian parameters that characterize their orbital dynamics, using recent high-precision pulsar timing data and a Bayesian parameter estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We do this via the TEMPO2 software, the MCMC4Tempo2 plugin, and a unified python pipeline to analyze the data. We then perform a combined analysis of different binary systems to constrain both the time evolution of Newton's constant and the dipolar emission parameter $\kappa_D$. For the best of our three pulsars (PSR J1713+0747), we obtain $\dot{G}/G = (0.32 \pm 0.31) \times 10^{-12}~\text{yr}^{-1}$ at 95\% confidence, along with a stringent constraint on the dipolar emission parameter, $\kappa_D = (-0.04 \pm 0.14) \times 10^{-4}$. Thanks to the recent high-precision timing data sets, we provide updated bounds on key parameters relevant to modified gravity theories, and we find that our results are consistent with GR.

#### Primordial black hole formation in matter domination

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18312

 - **Abstract**
 We study Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) formed by the collapse of rare primordial fluctuations during an early period of Matter Domination. The collapse threshold strongly depends on the shape of the peaks, decreasing as they become flatter and hence rarer. In the extreme limit of a top-hat perturbation, Harada, Kohri, Sasaki, Terada, and Yoo have argued that the growth of velocity dispersion prevents the formation of black holes unless the initial peak is larger than $\zeta_{\rm th} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms}^{2/5}$. Including the shape distribution of the peaks, we find that for a realistic cosmic abundance of PBHs, the effective threshold is larger, $\zeta_{\rm th} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms }^{1/10}$. And this model requires $\zeta_{\rm rms}\sim 10^{-1}$, which is much larger than the observed value at the CMB scales. Hence, PBH formation during Matter Domination is barely more efficient than Radiation Domination. We estimate the dimensionless spin parameter to be $a_{\rm rms} \sim \zeta_{\rm rms}^{7/4}\ll 1$, slightly larger than PBHs formed in Radiation Domination.

#### New models of nonsingular black hole dark matter from limiting curvature

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18322

 - **Abstract**
 We consider phenomenological models for nonsingular black hole that satisfy the limiting curvature condition (i.e., that have curvatures that are always sub-Planckian in size) while having a more general dependence on the black hole mass than the most studied examples. These models allow black holes to exist while having regulators that are larger than the horizon scale; it has been shown previously that this can lead to observable consequences in an astrophysical setting, for allowed choices for the regulator scale. Noting that substantial horizon-scale modifications of the metric will affect black hole thermodynamics and Hawking radiation, we study these metrics in the context of primordial black hole dark matter. Considering examples with de\,Sitter and Minkowski cores, respectively, we study the effect of the regulator in these metrics on the allowed black hole mass ranges (or ``bands"), the black hole temperature, specific heat and lifetime, and the bounds on the primordial black hole fraction of the total dark matter density from the observed extragalactic gamma ray background.

#### Effective Dynamics of Spherically Symmetric Static Spacetime

 - **Abstract**
 In general relativity, the Einstein equations provide spherically symmetric static spacetimes with dynamics defined as an evolution along the radial coordinate $r$. The geometrical sector becomes a one-dimensional mechanical system, with the Misner-Sharp mass and lapse as canonically conjugate variables, and a vanishing Hamiltonian for pure gravity. Coupling classical or quantum matter fields, or introducing (quantum) corrections to general relativity, then generate a non-vanishing effective Hamiltonian, leading to non-trivial evolutions of the mass and lapse. We illustrate this mechanism through various examples of classical matter fields and identify Hamiltonians describing the effective dynamics of gravity coupled to perfect fluids with linear barotropic equation of state. Finally, we derive effective Hamiltonians that reproduce the gravitational semi-classical dynamics coupled to renormalized quantum matter fields and discuss the conditions for which the singularity at $r=0$ is resolved. In particular, we find a singularity-free black-hole-like solution, stabilized by quantum matter, smoothly transitioning from a bulk with constant negative Ricci scalar to the standard outside Schwarzschild metric. This opens new possibilities for the modeling of both semi-classical corrections and deep quantum effects on the interior structure of self-gravitating compact objects and black holes.

#### Topological dark energy from spacetime foam: A challenge for $Λ$CDM

 - **Abstract**
 Using only the standard considerations of spacetime foam and the Euclidean Quantum Gravity techniques known long ago, we result to a model of Topological Dark Energy (TDE) that outperforms the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm with regard to data fitting efficiency. Specifically, it is known that at the foam level, topologically non-trivial solutions such as instantons appear. In the particular case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain an effective dynamical dark energy term proportional to the instanton density, and the latter can be easily calculated through standard techniques. Hence, we can immediately extract the differential equation that determines the evolution of the topologically induced effective dark energy density. Significantly, this TDE scenario allows for changing sign of dark energy during the cosmic evolution and also exhibits Dark Energy interaction with Dark Matter. We confront the TDE scenario, in both flat and non-flat cases, with Pantheon+/SH0ES Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), Baryonic Accoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) datasets. By applying standard model selection methods (AIC and DevIC information criteria), we find a moderate but statistically significant preference over $\Lambda$CDM scenario. Finally, we show that the TDE scenario passes constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and thus does not spoil the thermal history of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI) is essential for space-based gravitational wave (GW) missions, as it suppresses laser frequency noise and achieve the required sensitivity. Beyond the standard Michelson configuration, a variety of second-generation TDI schemes have been proposed, each utilizing different combinations of inter-spacecraft laser links. In this work, we conduct a comparative study of several representative TDI configurations with varying time spans and demonstrate that their (quasi-)orthogonal channels are highly correlated, indicating substantial redundancy among these schemes. In the low-frequency regime, the performance of different TDI configurations are nearly identical. Their distinctions emerge primarily at high frequencies, where the GW wavelength becomes comparable to the arm length. In this regime, shorter TDI time spans with minimal null frequencies facilitate more accurate waveform modeling and parameter recovery in frequency domain. In contrast, configurations with longer time spans and more null frequencies, such as the Michelson, are more susceptible to frequency aliasing and waveform modulation effects, which degrade inference accuracy. However, if signal modeling and analysis are performed in the time domain, all TDI configurations become effectively equivalent. Considering the usability in both frequency and time domain, the short-span PD4L scheme, which exhibits minimal nulls and superior performance in high frequencies, emerges as a promising candidate for future space-based GW mission designs.

#### Searching for Gravitational Waves with Gaia and its Cross-Correlation with PTA: Absolute vs Relative Astrometry

 - **Abstract**
 Astrometric missions like Gaia provide exceptionally precise measurements of stellar positions and proper motions. Gravitational waves traveling between the observer and distant stars can induce small, correlated shifts in these apparent positions, a phenomenon known as astrometric deflection. The precision and scale of astrometric datasets make them well-suited for searching for a stochastic gravitational wave background, whose signature appears in the two-point correlation function of the deflection field across the sky. Although Gaia achieves high accuracy in measuring angular separations in its focal plane, systematic uncertainties in the satellite's absolute orientation limit the precision of absolute position measurements. These orientation errors can be mitigated by focusing on relative angles between star pairs, which effectively cancel out common-mode orientation noise. In this work, we compute the astrometric response and the overlap reduction functions for this relative astrometry approach, correcting previous expressions presented in the literature. We use a Fisher matrix analysis to compare the sensitivity of relative astrometry to that of conventional absolute astrometry. Our analysis shows that while the relative method is theoretically sound, its sensitivity is limited for closely spaced star pairs within a single Gaia field of view. Pairs with large angular separations could provide competitive sensitivity, but are practically inaccessible due to Gaia's scanning law. Finally, we demonstrate that combining astrometric data with observations from pulsar timing arrays leads to slight improvements in sensitivity at frequencies greater than approximately 10^-7 Hz.

#### Page Curve for an Evaporating Schwarzschild Black Hole in Dimensionally-Reduced Model of Dilaton Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We study entanglement entropy of quantum fields in a (1+1)-dimensional model of dilaton gravity derived from the four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action by dimensional reduction. Scalar matter is coupled to gravity, while the back-reaction is included via the Polyakov-Liouville action. This theory exhibits both eternal and evaporating Schwarzschild black hole solutions. The fine-grained entropy in a collapse scenario is investigated by applying the "island rule" via the quantum extremal surface approach. We demonstrate that the fine-grained entropy of the Hawking radiation follows the Page curve, and therefore the evolution of the Hawking radiation is unitary.

#### On Supersymmetric D-brane probes in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $\text{AdS}_2\times\mathbf{S}^2$ Attractors

 - **Abstract**
 We extend the $\kappa$-symmetry analysis of supersymmetric D-brane probes in the $\mathrm{AdS}_2 \times \mathbf{S}^2$ attractor geometry, originally performed by Simons, Strominger, Thompson, and Yin, to also include stationary -- but non-static -- worldlines carrying angular momentum along the 2-sphere. We demonstrate that certain special trajectories, with fixed radius and orbital velocity, solve the equations of motion and moreover satisfy a supersymmetry preserving condition, thus defining new $\frac12$-BPS configurations. Furthermore, these classical paths are shown to saturate a lower bound for the Hamiltonian generating global time translations, with the corresponding minimal energy depending on a generalized angular momentum vector $\boldsymbol{J}$. The direction of the latter, in turn, determines exactly which supercharges remain unbroken. Our results reveal a richer spectrum of (multi-particle) supersymmetric states in $\mathrm{AdS}_2 \times \mathbf{S}^2$, which can be organized into distinct selection sectors labeled by the conserved $SU(2)$ charges. This construction has direct applications in black hole microstate counting, the analysis of probe dynamics and $\text{AdS}_2/\text{CFT}_1$ holography.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose alternative \textit{UV completion} of pure JT gravity as well as CFT coupled to JT gravity, via a class of \textit{deformed} 2D CFT. In AdS/CFT with a prescribed classical limit, pure JT gravity in \textit{one-sided} AdS$_{2}$ black hole is argued to be described by certain holographic deformed CFT on a strip. Equivalently, these deformed CFTs can be recast as CFTs on one-sided AdS$_{2}$ black hole with \textit{emergent conformal boundary condition on a stretched horizon}$-$providing a \textit{proper UV frame} of JT gravity. On the other hand, JT gravity coupled to CFT with fixed central charge of $\mathcal{O}(1)$, is also described by deformed CFT on strip satisfying conformal boundary condition, with a different classical limit. The resulting CFT Hilbert spaces in both of the above classical limits yield the black hole entropy as thermal entropy and the high-energy density of states match that of JT gravity with a precise energy scale correspondence. Moreover, the Hilbert space defined for a two-sided black hole factorizes into two one-sided sectors in both limits. Notably in the second limit, degenerate zero modes of the deformed Hamiltonian$-$characterized by conformal primaries localized at the horizon$-$appear as a residual effect of the stretched horizon boundary condition. Exploiting the second limit, we compute entanglement entropy in one-dimensional quantum systems dual to a conformally glued black hole$-$Poincaré geometry in JT gravity, reproducing a `Page curve' via the quantum extremal surface prescription, with `Page time' set by the stretched horizon cutoff.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider a class of two-dimensional dilaton gravity models with linear dilaton vacuum including Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger (CGHS) model as the special case. General thermodynamic properties of black holes in such models are evaluated. We focus on the CGHS model and its modification with regular black holes as empty-space solutions characterized by ever-present finite curvature. We find generalized entanglement entropy blows-up for near-extremal regular black holes considered as remnants. That signalling a possible breakdown of the semiclassical approximation near the endpoint of evaporation. We conjecture that remnants are unstable and decay by quantum fluctuations into horizonless spacetimes. We give an estimate for the decay amplitude by using a semiclassical regularization method and propose a path to mitigate the unitarity loss problem.

 - **Abstract**
 The computation of gravitational wave scattering on black hole spacetimes is an extremely hard problem, typically requiring approximation schemes which either treat the black hole perturbatively or are only amenable to numerical techniques. In this paper, we consider linearised gravitational waves (or gravitons) scattering on the self-dual analogue of a black hole: namely, the self-dual Taub-NUT metric. Using the hidden integrability of the self-dual sector, we can solve the linearised Einstein equations on these self-dual black hole backgrounds exactly in terms of simple, explicit quasi-momentum eigenstates. Using a description of the self-dual Taub-NUT metric and its gravitons in terms of twistor theory, we obtain an explicit formula, exact in the background, for the tree-level maximal helicity violating graviton scattering amplitude at arbitrary multiplicity, with and without spin. This is obtained from the description of the MHV amplitudes in terms of the perturbation theory of a chiral sigma model whose target is the twistor space of the background. The incorporation of spin effects on these backgrounds is a straightforward application of the Newman-Janis shift. We also demonstrate that the holomorphic collinear splitting functions in the self-dual background are equal to those in flat space so that the celestial symmetry algebra is undeformed.
