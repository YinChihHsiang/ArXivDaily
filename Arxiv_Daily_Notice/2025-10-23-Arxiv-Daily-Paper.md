 - **Abstract**
 The distribution of molecular gas on small scales regulates star formation and the growth of supermassive black holes in galaxy centers, yet the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in shaping this distribution remains poorly constrained. We investigate how AGN influence the small-scale structure of molecular gas in galaxy centers, by measuring the clumpiness of CO(3 - 2) emission observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the nuclear regions (50 - 200 pc from the AGN) of 16 nearby Seyfert galaxies from the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). To quantify clumpiness, we apply three different methods: (1) the median of the pixel-by-pixel contrast between the original and smoothed maps; (2) the ratio of the total excess flux to the total flux, after substracting the background smoothed emission; and (3) the fraction of total flux coming from clumpy regions, interpreted as the mass fraction in clumps. We find a negative correlation between molecular gas clumpiness and AGN X-ray luminosity (L_X), suggesting that higher AGN activity is associated with smoother gas distributions. All methods reveal a turnover in this relation around L_X = 10^{42} erg/s, possibly indicating a threshold above which AGN feedback becomes efficient at dispersing dense molecular structures and suppressing future star formation. Our findings provide new observational evidence that AGN feedback can smooth out dense gas structures in galaxy centers.

 - **Abstract**
 Using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations at (sub)millimeter wavelengths, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) currently achieves the finest angular resolution of any astronomical facility, necessary for imaging the horizon-scale structure around supermassive black holes. A significant calibration challenge for high-frequency VLBI stems from rapid variations in the atmospheric water vapor content above each telescope in the array, which induce corresponding fluctuations in the phase of the correlated signal that limit the coherent integration time and thus the achievable sensitivity. In this paper, we introduce a model that describes station-based phase corruptions jointly with a parameterization for the source structure. We adopt a Gaussian Process (GP) prescription for the time evolution of these phase corruptions, which provides sufficient flexibility to capture even highly erratic phase behavior. The use of GPs permits the application of a Kalman filtering algorithm for numerical marginalization of these phase corruptions, which permits efficient exploration of the remaining parameter space. Our model also removes the need to specify an arbitrary ``reference station'' during calibration, instead establishing a global phase zeropoint by enforcing the GPs at all stations to have fixed mean and finite variance. We validate our method using a real EHT observation of the blazar 3C 279, demonstrating that our approach yields calibration solutions that are consistent with those determined by the EHT Collaboration. The model presented here can be straightforwardly extended to incorporate frequency-dependent phase behavior, such as is relevant for the frequency phase transfer calibration technique.

 - **Abstract**
 Surrounding Sgr A*, a cluster of young and massive stars coexist with a population of dust-enshrouded objects, whose astrometric data can be used to scrutinize the nature of Sgr A*. An alternative to the black hole (BH) scenario has been recently proposed in terms of a supermassive compact object composed of self-gravitating fermionic dark matter (DM). Such horizon-less configurations can reproduce the relativistic effects measured for S2 orbit, while being part of a single continuous configuration whose extended halo reproduces the latest GAIA-DR3 rotation curve. In this work, we statistically compare different fermionic DM configurations aimed to fit the astrometric data of S2, and five G-sources, and compare with the BH potential when appropriate. We sample the parameter spaces via Markov Chain Monte Carlo statistics and perform a quantitative comparison estimating Bayes factors for models that share the same likelihood function. We extend previous results of the S2 and G2 orbital fits for 56 keV fermions (low core-compactness) and show the results for 300 keV fermions (high core-compactness). For the selected S2 dataset, the former model is slightly favoured over the latter. However, more precise S2 datasets, as obtained by the GRAVITY instrument, remain to be analysed in light of the fermionic models. For the G-objects, no conclusive preference emerges between models. For all stellar objects tested, the BH and fermionic models predict orbital parameters that differ by less than 1%. More accurate data, particularly from stars closer to Sgr A*, is necessary to statistically distinguish between the models considered.

 - **Abstract**
 Eighteen years after their discovery, the astronomical sources and radiation mechanisms of fast radio bursts remain mysterious. Their radiation is as bright as that of pulsars, with brightness temperatures as high as $\sim 10^{36}$ K, implying coherent emission, but the plasma physics that forms the coherent charge bunches, with net charges of order a Coulomb, is not understood. Some FRB have been identified with galaxies at redshifts of a few tenths, but one originated within a globular cluster in the galaxy M81 at a distance of 3.6 Mpc. A minority of FRB have been observed to repeat, in some cases thousands of times. The vast majority of FRB have not been observed to repeat, but it is not known if they are truly ``one-offs'' or repeat at unobservably long intervals. Some FRB originate within dense, rapidly varying, plasma environments, while others appear to be surrounded by high vacuum. Hypotheses for their sources include magnetars and black hole accretion discs.

 - **Abstract**
 The sound horizon scale $r_s$ is a key source of information for early-time $H_0$ measurements, and is therefore a common target of new physics proposed to solve the Hubble tension. We present a sub-2% measurement of the Hubble constant that is independent of this scale, using data from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR1). Building on previous work, we remove dependency on the sound horizon size using a heuristic rescaling procedure at the power spectrum level. A key innovation is the inclusion of \emph{uncalibrated} (agnostic to $r_s$) post-reconstruction BAO measurements from DESI DR1, as well as using the CMB acoustic scale $\theta_*$ as a high-redshift anchor. Uncalibrated type-Ia supernovae are often included as an independent source of $\Omega_m$ information; here we demonstrate the robustness of our results by additionally considering two supernova-independent alternative datasets. We find somewhat higher values of $H_0$ relative to our previous work: $69.2^{+1.3}_{-1.4}$, $70.3^{+1.4}_{-1.2}$, and $69.6^{+1.3}_{-1.8}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ respectively when including measurements from i) Planck/ACT CMB lensing $\times$ unWISE galaxies, ii) the DES Year 3 6$\times$2pt analysis, and iii) Planck/ACT CMB lensing + the DES Year 5 supernova analysis. These remarkably consistent constraints achieve better than 2% precision; they are among the most stringent sound horizon-independent measurements from LSS to date, and provide a powerful avenue for probing the origin of the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning enables powerful cosmological inference but typically requires many high-fidelity simulations covering many cosmological models. Transfer learning offers a way to reduce the simulation cost by reusing knowledge across models. We show that pre-training on the standard model of cosmology, $\Lambda$CDM, and fine-tuning on various beyond-$\Lambda$CDM scenarios -- including massive neutrinos, modified gravity, and primordial non-Gaussianities -- can enable inference with significantly fewer beyond-$\Lambda$CDM simulations. However, we also show that negative transfer can occur when strong physical degeneracies exist between $\Lambda$CDM and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameters. We consider various transfer architectures, finding that including bottleneck structures provides the best performance. Our findings illustrate the opportunities and pitfalls of foundation-model approaches in physics: pre-training can accelerate inference, but may also hinder learning new physics.

#### Nearly Monochromatic Primordial Black Holes as total Dark Matter from Bubble Collapse

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a two-field model where the inflaton $\chi$ is non-minimally coupled to the instanton $\phi$. By choosing an appropriate coupling function, we realize the scenario where the difference of the values of potential between false vacuum (FV) and true vacuum (TV) is maximized during inflation. Most of the bubbles are created at this time. After inflation ends, the potential value of FV drops below that of TV so that these bubbles collapse to form primordial black holes (PBHs). By tuning the parameters of our model, we analyze the Coleman-de Luccia (CDL) and Hawking-Moss (HM) process, finding that the corresponding mass function of PBHs is sharply peaked, implying that we can realize either PBHs as cold dark matter, sub-solar PBHs, or supermassive PBHs in this scenario without enhancement of primordial curvature perturbations.

#### On the origins, growth, and radiative efficiency of J0529-4351, reportedly the fastest-growing known black hole

 - **Abstract**
 SMSS J0521-4351 is reportedly the most luminous quasar known to date, and assuming a mean radiative efficiency of 0.1, it is inferred to be the fastest-growing black hole, accreting approximately one solar mass per day. Assessing the implications of this assumption on the seed mass and inception time of J0529-4351, we show that the inferred accretion rate is unreasonably high and that its radiative efficiency must be much greater than 0.1. Then, we derive its accretion rate and seed mass, and for comparison of three other similar-size (~1-2E+10 solar masses) black holes at various redshifts, using well-tested empirical scaling relations. The results indicate that J0529-4351 grew from a heavy seed (~2-3E+04 solar masses), and that its accretion rate (~10-13 solar masses/year) is the lowest of the four black holes. However, its radiative efficiency inferred from its bolometric luminosity and the derived accretion rate is the highest, which explains why it is the most luminous despite having the lowest accretion rate. This study challenges the prevailing notion that a higher luminosity or a higher Eddington ratio implies a higher accretion rate, highlights the dependence of a black hole's luminosity on radiative efficiency, reveals the pitfalls of inferring black hole properties assuming a standard value for radiative efficiency, and suggests that the Eddington ratios of high-luminosity BHs may be significantly overestimated.

#### The impact of superradiance on the spin evolution of variably accreting massive black holes

 - **Abstract**
 This paper explores how time-varying increases in mass accretion onto rapidly spinning black holes influence their long-term spin evolution when affected by superradiance - a process where energy is extracted from the black hole by a surrounding axion field. Using simulations the study tracks how sudden accretion boosts affect a critical spin-down phase (the superradiance drop) during which the black hole's spin rapidly decreases while its mass remains nearly constant. The black hole spin evolution is controlled by the competition between two processes: how fast angular momentum is added through accretion, and how fast it is removed by the axion cloud. One major conclusion is that boosts to the accretion rate before the superradiance drop have the strongest effect, as they can delay or reshape the drop and significantly shrink the region of the mass-spin plane depopulated due to the superradiance. In particular, a super-Eddington accretion rate of 5 times Eddington accretion, lasting for 4 Myr and occurring 30 Myr before the superradiance drop can reduce the superradiance exclusion region in the mass-spin plane by 40 percent. In contrast, boosts to the accretion rate after the superradiance drop only cause temporary changes in the black hole spin. The study also shows that black holes with lighter axion clouds are more sensitive to these early boosts and can show observable spin changes lasting tens to hundreds of millions of years. Heavier axion clouds, however, require much stronger or longer-lasting boosts to produce similar effects, making them more stable under variable accretion.

#### Probing Accretion Disk Winds of Stratified Nature with Fe XXVI Doublet in Black Hole X-ray Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Powerful ionized accretion disk winds are often observed during episodic outbursts in Galactic black hole transients. Among those X-ray absorbers, \fexxvi\ doublet structure (Ly$\alpha_1$+Ly$\alpha_2$ with $\sim 20$eV apart) has a unique potential to better probe the underlying physical nature of the wind; i.e. density and kinematics. We demonstrate, based on a physically-motivated magnetic disk wind scenario of a stratified structure in density and velocity, that the doublet line profile can be effectively utilized as a diagnostics to measure wind density and associated velocity dispersion (due to thermal turbulence and/or dynamical shear motion in winds). Our simulated doublet spectra with post-process radiative transfer calculations indicate that the profile can be (1) broad with a single peak for higher velocity dispersion ($\gsim 5,000$ km~s$^{-1}$), (2) a standard shape with 1:2 canonical flux ratio for moderate dispersion ($\sim 1,000-5,000$ km~s$^{-1}$) or (3) double-peaked with its flux ratio approaching 1:1 for lower velocity dispersion ($\lsim 1,000$ km~s$^{-1}$) in optically-thin regime, allowing various line shape. Such a diversity in doublet profile is indeed unambiguously seen in recent observations with XRISM/Resolve at microcalorimeter resolution. We show that some implications inferred from the model will help constrain the local wind physics where \fexxvi\ is predominantly produced in a large-scale, stratified wind.

#### Accretion with two-phase gas supply and its application in black hole X-ray binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion in black hole X-ray binaries is commonly believed to be supplied by the Roche lobe overflow or the stellar wind. The former is thought to form a geometrically thin disc while the diffuse wind could form a geometrically thick hot accretion flow. In this paper, we instead consider a more generalised case, i.e., accretion with both cold and hot gas supplies, which feed a disc and a corona respectively. We investigate the interaction of disc and corona by analysing the energy coupling and matter exchange, i.e. corona condensation/disc evaporation, with a semi-analytical method. It is found that the accretion geometry in the radial direction and the resultant emission spectrum depend strongly on both the total gas supply rate and the ratio of cold and hot gases. For gas supply rates of a few percent of the Eddington value, diverse geometries and spectral shapes are possible, depending on the fraction of cold gas supply. This provides an interpretation for the various spectra observed in intermediate states. However, at higher accretion rates, regardless of the form of the feeding gas, the inner accretion flow is always disc-dominated, implying an inevitable transition to the soft state, while at very low gas supply rates, hard state spectrum dominated by the hot flow is expected. We also present the predicted hardness-intensity correlation of Cygnus X-1, and constrain the value of the viscosity parameter of the accretion flow to the range of 0.25--0.35 by comparing our results with MAXI observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The Standard Model of particle physics successfully describes all known fundamental particles and their interactions; however, it leaves several unanswered questions. Theories beyond the Standard Model typically introduce new particles and symmetries to address these issues. In the early universe, when such particles become non-relativistic, or the symmetries are broken, there are associated reductions in the equation of state of the primordial plasma. These reductions lead to an exponential enhancement in the formation rate of primordial black holes. In this paper, we calculate the equation of state for several supersymmetric and composite Higgs models, which naturally predict a large number of additional degrees of freedom. Using these equations of state, we compute some example primordial black hole abundances, which we find can be enhanced by up to 20 orders of magnitude.

#### The Impact of Population III.1 Flash Reionization for CMB Polarization and Thomson Scattering Optical Depth

 - **Abstract**
 The Population III.1 theory for supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation predicts a very early ($z\sim20-25$), transient phase, ``The Flash'', of cosmic reionization powered by supermassive stars that are SMBH progenitors. The universe then quickly recombined to become mostly neutral, with this state persisting until galaxies begin to reionize intergalactic gas again at $z\sim 10$. The overall Thomson scattering optical depth, $\tau$, from The Flash has been shown to be $\tau_{\rm PopIII.1}\sim0.03$, leading to a total $\tau\sim0.08-0.09$. Such a value, while significantly larger than that previously inferred from {\it Planck} observations of the low-$l$ $EE$ polarization power spectrum of the CMB, can help relieve several ``tensions'' faced by the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, especially the preference for negative neutrino masses and dynamic dark energy. Here we compute $EE$ power spectra of example models of The Flash. We find that, because of its very high redshift, the contribution to $l\lesssim8$ modes is dramatically reduced compared to usual low-$z$ reionization models for the same value of $\tau$, while the power at $l\gtrsim8$ is boosted. Thus the Pop III.1 reionization scenario provides a natural way to increase $\tau$, while remaining closer to the latest CMB low-$l$ polarization observations.

#### Detecting gravitational lensing by matter currents

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the observational prospects for detecting gravitational lensing induced by cosmological matter currents, a relativistic correction to the standard scalar lensing effect arising from the motion of matter. We propose to isolate this contribution by cross-correlating the weak-lensing convergence field with a reconstructed cosmic momentum field inferred from galaxy surveys. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this reconstructed momentum field is uncorrelated with the scalar lensing signal, enabling a clean separation of the gravitomagnetic component. We then forecast the detectability of this signal for upcoming wide-field galaxy and weak-lensing surveys, showing that a statistically significant detection may be achievable under realistic observational conditions. Such a measurement would provide the first direct probe of the large-scale cosmic momentum field, offering a novel test of general relativity and Lorentz invariance on cosmological scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Among the emerging excess of massive, bright galaxies at Cosmic Dawn $z \gtrsim 9$ seen by the James Webb Space Telescope, several exhibit spectral features associated with active galactic nuclei (AGN). These AGN candidates suggest that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow rapidly in the early Universe. In a series of numerical experiments, we investigate how SMBHs grow within and influence the most massive galaxies at Cosmic Dawn using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations run with the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES. Our suite of simulations explore how super-Eddington accretion, seed mass, and the strength of feedback influence SMBH-galaxy co-evolution in the early Universe. We find that SMBH growth is sensitive to stellar feedback which generates a turbulent-multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) that stochastically starves the SMBH. In the absence of AGN feedback, we find that the SMBH is starved $\sim 50\%$ of the time after the onset of star formation in the galaxy. SMBH growth can become self-regulated by AGN feedback if the SMBH becomes massive enough, either by accretion or seeding, for its feedback to dominate the surrounding nuclear region. We find no evidence of galaxy-scale, AGN-driven quenching in the star formation rate (SFR) across all simulations in our suite.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that retarded Green's functions of black hole spacetimes can be expressed as a convergent mode sum everywhere in spacetime. At late times a quasinormal mode sum converges, while at early times a Matsubara (or, Euclidean) mode sum converges. The two regions are separated by a lightcone which scatters from the black hole potential. The Matsubara sum is a Fourier series on the Euclidean thermal circle associated to the early time region. We illustrate our results for Pöschl-Teller, BTZ, and Schwarzschild. In the case of Schwarzschild, we express the branch cut contribution as a convergent sum of de Sitter quasinormal modes as $\Lambda\to 0^+$, and exploit recent exact solutions to the Heun connection problem. In each case we analytically show convergence by studying the asymptotics of residue sums and also provide numerical demonstrations.

 - **Abstract**
 If a black hole is immersed in a magnetosphere,its rotational energy can be transferred to the electromagnetic field and escape as a Poynting flux to infinity. This process of extraction of rotational energy is known as the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. It relies on the presence of both a magnetosphere and an ergosphere surrounding the black hole. Previously, we showed that rotating wormholes are also capable of emitting a Poynting flux in the process of accreting magnetized matter. In this work, we re-examine the Blandford-Znajek mechanism in the case of a Kerr-type wormhole. For the first time, we solve the stream equation in a rotating wormhole spacetime and derive analytical expressions for the magnetic field. We then compute the associated Poynting flux. Our results indicate that the electromagnetic flux in the wormhole spacetime is weaker than in the Kerr case, and this difference becomes more pronounced as the geometries of the two spacetimes increasingly deviate.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a complete pipeline for detecting and characterising gravitational waves (GWs) produced by the inspiral of stellar-mass binary black holes in data from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The analysis framework relies on an efficient time-frequency implementation of an adaptive semi-coherent detection statistic, which we show to be robust against non-stationary noise and the presence of gaps of varying duration and cadence. The search is able to detect signals down to a coherent signal-to-noise ratio $\approx$ 11 over the full parameter space of black holes with spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum and orbital eccentricity $\leq$ 0.01 when deployed on the 2-year-long LISA Data Challenge Yorsh. The search can be run within a day using $\approx$ 40 GPUs. The techniques presented here have wider applications in GW astronomy, in particular the search for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals in LISA data.

 - **Abstract**
 The growing number of binary black hole mergers detected through gravitational waves offers unprecedented insight into their underlying population, yet their astrophysical formation channels remain unresolved. We present a new method to distinguish binary black hole formation channels using their spatial clustering at cosmological scales. Employing the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation Illustris, we trace the distribution of mergers across cosmic time and compare them with the underlying matter distribution associated with three candidate origins: isolated binary stellar evolution, binaries embedded in AGN disks, and primordial black holes within dark matter halos. For mergers at redshift $z \lesssim 0.5$, these channels show distinct clustering signatures that could be accessible with proposed upgrades to current ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. Using mock catalogs for next- generation facilities such as Cosmic Explorer, we find that their sensitivities would enable differentiation of these formation pathways out to redshift $z \sim 5$ within the first decade of observations. This approach provides a new framework to link gravitational-wave populations with the large-scale structure of the Universe. By treating black hole mergers as cosmological tracers, our results demonstrate how cross- correlations between gravitational-wave catalogs and the cosmic matter field can constrain the relative contribution of stellar, AGN, and primordial channels, offering a complementary probe to population- inference studies. These findings underscore the emerging potential of gravitational-wave cosmology to reveal where and how black holes form and merge across cosmic history.

 - **Abstract**
 By employing Duan's topological method, we classify critical points by their topological charge Q = +/-1 or 0. Previous work (Wei et al., Phys. Rev. D 105, 104003, 2022) investigated two typical anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes: the Reissner-Nordstroem (RN) case (with only one critical point Q = -1) and the Born-Infeld (BI) case (with two critical points Q = +/-1). In this work, we first find that all three types of critical points appear in quantum anomalous black holes for 4D spacetime. We then compute the quasinormal modes of massless scalar perturbations near these critical points and find that both the oscillation frequency and damping rate increase with the black hole radius at the critical temperature. Besides such common behavior, although the Q = +1 and Q = 0 cases do not show a discernible pattern due to the limited number of samples, the Q = -1 case exhibits very similar dynamical characteristics across all three black hole solutions, implying a nontrivial connection between topological thermodynamics and dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the observational signatures of thin accretion disks around a reflection-asymmetric traversable thin-shell wormhole. This wormhole, built in the framework of Palatini $f(R)$ gravity coupled to a Maxwell field using a junction conditions formalism, lacks horizons but features photon spheres on each side of the throat, described by different effective potentials and at different locations. This fact allows a portion of the light rays arriving to the observer's screen on one side of the throat to have explored a part of the space-time on the other side, bringing information about the geometry gathered there. In this setting we simulate the optical appearance of such an asymmetric wormhole when illuminated by thin accretion disks, investigating scenarios with either one or two (on each side of the throat) disks, revealing a rich multi-photon ring structure due to light crossing the throat, and a strong reduction in the size of the central brightness depression region. These new rings are more numerous and far more luminous in the two-disk case than in the single-disk case, and the shadow's size reduction far more acute, making a neat distinction as compared to canonical black hole images. These results highlight the potential of high-resolution imaging in providing smoking guns for the existence of ultra-compact objects distinct from black holes via their multi-ring structure.

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamical captures of black holes are unique events that provide an exceptional opportunity to probe the strong-field regime of gravitational physics. In this article, we perform numerical relativity simulations to study the events of dynamical capture of two equal-mass non-spinning black holes. We consider a suite of scenarios within a range of initial linear momenta ($p/M=0.095-0.75$) and incidence angles ($\theta=6.36^\circ-2.83^\circ$), and study the emitted Weyl scalar ($\Psi_4$) of each case, as well as the spins and masses of the black holes before and after they merge. We provide a simple analytical model which accurately fits the gravitational-wave emission. We study the dependence of the time-interval between the capture and the merger emissions with respect to the incidence angle, which can be well parametrized by a first-order divergent behavior, allowing to find the angle that separates a scattering event from a dynamical capture. We also find that, in general, the parameters that model the first emission can be well described by linear or exponentially decaying functions in terms of the incidence angle, while others display more complex behaviors that offer valuable insights into the nature of these events.

 - **Abstract**
 Rotating hairy black holes (RHBHs) are axisymmetric equilibrium solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations, consisting of a spinning black hole surrounded by a toroidal distribution of complex scalar field. Despite their potential astrophysical relevance, the stability of these configurations -naturally expected to form through superradiant growth of light bosonic fields- remains uncertain. In this work, we investigate the stability of RHBHs by performing fully non-linear numerical evolutions of several configurations that differ in the relative mass contribution of the scalar-field torus. We find that configurations in which the scalar field mass is subdominant compared to the black hole mass remain stable throughout the evolution. In contrast, when the scalar-field mass dominates, the system develops an instability akin to the non-axisymmetric instability observed in rotating boson stars. Given the expected limits on the scalar-field mass growth achievable through superradiance, our results suggest that rotating hairy black holes formed predominantly by this process are expected to be stable.

 - **Abstract**
 It is known that linearized perturbations of extremal black holes result in growing curvature on the horizon. However, nonlinear perturbations typically do not evolve to extremal black holes and do not have growing curvature at late times. We show that a large class of nonlinear perturbations of an extremal planar anti-de Sitter black hole does have horizon curvature that grows unbounded in time. The late time behavior of the nonlinear evolution is found to be captured by a linearized analysis. We argue that the generic nonlinear perturbation behaves similarly.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe a new tunneling solution for the decay of a cosmic string into a burst of gravitational waves. We find the relevant instanton and compute the tunneling rate. Locally, our solution is just an analytic continuation of the Kerr metric (but there is no black hole in our solution). An interesting feature of our result is that there is a conical singularity in the initial state but there is no singularity in the final state. This demonstrates that singularities can disappear in quantum gravity in ways that are impossible in classical gravity.

#### Geometric Symmetries for the Vanishing of the Black Hole Tidal Love Numbers

 - **Abstract**
 We present a unified geometric perspective on the symmetries underlying the spin 0, 1 and 2 static perturbations around a Schwarzschild black hole. In all cases, the symmetries are exact, each forming an SO(3,1) group. They can be formulated at the level of the action, provided the appropriate field variables are chosen. For spin 1 and 2, the convenient variables are certain combinations of the gauge fields for even perturbations, and dual scalars for odd perturbations. The even and odd sector each has its own SO(3,1) symmetry. In addition, there is an SO(2) symmetry connecting them, furnishing an economical description of Chandrasekhar's duality. When decomposed in spherical harmonics, the perturbations form a non-trivial representation of SO(3,1), giving rise to ladder symmetries which explain the vanishing of the tidal Love numbers. Our work builds on earlier discussions of ladder symmetries, which were formulated in terms of the Newman-Penrose scalar at the level of the Teukolsky equation. Our formulation makes it possible to state the symmetries responsible for the vanishing of the Wilson coefficients characterizing the spin 0, 1 and 2 static tidal response, in the effective point particle description of a black hole.

#### On the stabilizer complexity of Hawking radiation

 - **Abstract**
 We study the complexity of Hawking radiation for an evaporating black hole from the perspective of the stabilizer theory of quantum computation. Specifically, we calculate Wigner negativity -- a magic monotone which can be interpreted as a measure of the stabilizer complexity, or equivalently, the complexity of classical simulation -- in various toy models for evaporating black holes. We first calculate the Wigner negativity of Hawking radiation in the PSSY model directly using the gravitational path integral, and show that the negativity is $O(1)$ before the Page transition, but becomes exponentially large past the Page transition. We also derive a universal, information theoretic formula for the negativity which interpolates between the two extremes. We then study the Wigner negativity of radiation in a dynamical model of black hole evaporation. In this case, the negativity shows a sharp spike at early times resulting from the coupling between the black hole and the radiation system, but at late times when the system settles down, we find that the negativity satisfies the same universal formula as in the PSSY model. Finally, we also propose a geometric formula for Wigner negativity in general holographic states using intuition from fixed area states and random tensor networks, and argue that a python's lunch in the entanglement wedge implies a stabilizer complexity which is exponentially large in $\frac{1}{8G_N}$ times the difference between the areas corresponding to the outermost and minimal extremal surfaces.
