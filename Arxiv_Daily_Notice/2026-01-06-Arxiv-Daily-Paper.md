#### Testing supermassive primordial black holes with lensing signals of binary black hole merges

 - **Abstract**
 Next-generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are expected to observe millions of binary black hole mergers, a fraction of which will be strongly lensed by intervening galaxies or clusters, producing multiple images with characteristic distribution of time delay. Importantly, the predicted rate and properties of such events are sensitive to the abundance and distribution of strong lensing objects which directly depends on cosmological models. One such scenario posits the existence of supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) in the early universe, which would enhance the formation of dark matter halos. This mechanism has been proposed to explain the abundance of high-redshift galaxies observed by James Webb Space Telescope. Crucially, the same cosmological model with SMPBHs would also leave a distinct imprint on the population of strongly lensed GWs. It predicts both an increased event rate and a modified distribution of time delays between the multiple images. Therefore, we propose statistical measurements of the rate and time delay distribution of strong lensing GW events as a powerful probe to directly constrain the abundance of SMPBHs. Considering $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with (non-)clustered SMPBHs, we find that the abundance of SMPBHs $f_{\rm PBH}$ with masses above $10^8~M_{\odot}$ is constrained to be $\sim10^{-4}$ at $95\%$ confidence level. It will be comparable and complementary to the currently available constraint from large scale structure observations.

#### Effective dark matter component presents a robust signature of negative pressure by the DESI observations

 - **Abstract**
 Comprehensive cosmological analysis of an effective non-standard dark matter(NSDM) model, characterized by an equation of state $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = w_2 a^2$, which allows for mild deviations from the previously assumed pressureless cold dark matter, is elaborated in the present work. This effective description framework is the scenarios that matter contents coupled to three distinct single-parameter dynamical dark energy models: i.e, the thawing scalar field, the Modified Emergent Dark Energy(MEDE) scenario, and the constant-$w$ model. We constrain these frameworks by using the latest cosmological probes, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation(BAO) measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument(DESI), and three compilations of Type Ia Supernovae(SN Ia) namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus (PP) sample. Across all three dark energy scenarios and all dataset combinations, we find a consistent preference for negative values of the parameter $w_2$. Furthermore, this result is robust against the choice of dark energy parametrization, suggesting a model-independent deviation from "standard" cold dark matter. This result indicates that the dark matter fluid possesses a small but non-vanishing negative pressure, meaning a non-cold nature. While the inferred Hubble constant $H_0$ remains consistent with the Planck $\Lambda$CDM value and does not fully alleviate the $H_0$ tension with local measurements, the persistent detection of $w_2 < 0$ across a wide range of independent cosmological probes provides compelling evidence for new physics in the dark matter sector -- suggesting that dark matter may be better described as an effective fluid endowed with a mild negative pressure, rather than as a perfectly cold, pressureless substance.

#### Indication of the Less-ionized Clumpy Ultra-Fast Outflows in Seyfert Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic investigation of X-ray spectral variability of Seyfert 1 galaxies using a ``spectral-ratio model fitting'' technique, which we developed to estimate contribution of the putative clumpy absorbers to the spectral variations. Archival XMM-Newton observations of 12 active galactic nuclei were analyzed to constrain properties of these absorbers. Our analysis demonstrates that the soft X-ray variability is primarily governed by fluctuation of the partial covering fraction of mildly ionized clumpy clouds. In particular, for Mrk 335, PDS 456, and 1H 0707-495, outflow velocities of the clumpy absorbers are constrained from the blue-shifts of the Fe-L edge structure. The blue-shifted Fe-L edge successfully reproduces the well-known complex spectral feature near 1 keV in 1H 0707--495, which was often explained by invoking an ad hoc absorption structure. Notably, the inferred outflow velocities of the clumpy absorbers are comparable to, or even exceed, those associated with the Ultra-Fast Outflows (UFOs). Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between the outflow velocities and the intrinsic X-ray fluxes in two of four data sets, and the remaining two datasets also agree with this positive correlation, which supports a radiative-driven wind scenario that the X-ray/UV emission from the central black holes is causing the UFOs and the outflowing clumpy absorbers. In addition, the line-driven acceleration is likely playing a significant role, since the line opacities of the clumpy absorbers are highly sensitive to the flux changes. These findings provide a robust observational support for the ``hot inner and clumpy outer wind'' paradigm, suggesting a common origin for both the UFOs and the clumpy absorbers.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmology has entered an era of unprecedented precision, yet increasing accuracy has revealed cracks in the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Although the model remains highly successful when confronted with individual datasets, joint analyses expose a network of tensions involving the Hubble constant, CMB lensing, curvature, neutrino masses, and the nature of dark energy. In this contribution to the 3rd General Meeting of the COST Action COSMIC WISPers (CA21106), within the context of Working Group~2, we critically assess these discrepancies, emphasizing the role of model assumptions, parameter degeneracies, and dataset consistency. We review proposed early- and late-time solutions, discuss how recent DESI BAO results alter the viability of late-time extensions, and explore interacting dark-sector scenarios. Our analysis highlights the need for caution in interpreting cosmological measurements and underscores the importance of internal consistency among cosmological probes before claiming percent-level accuracy or invoking new physics.

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube observations point to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) as promising contributors to the observed astrophysical neutrino flux. Close to the central black hole, protons can be accelerated through magnetic reconnection to very high energies and subsequently interact with abundant X-ray photons in the source, leading to neutrino production. We investigate whether the diffuse neutrino flux observed by IceCube can originate, via proton acceleration, in reconnection-powered coronae of non-jetted AGN. We create a library of neutrino spectral templates, over a large grid of values for the three key model parameters: the proton plasma magnetization of the corona $\sigma_{\rm p}$, the X-ray coronal luminosity, and the black hole mass. Synchrotron cooling of pions and muons plays a significant role due to the large coronal magnetic fields. We couple the single-source model with a mock AGN catalog, consistent with the observed X-ray and mid-infrared AGN samples at redshifts $z=0-4$, to infer the diffuse neutrino flux. Coronal emission satisfactorily explains the most recent IceCube measurements of the diffuse neutrino flux up to energies of $\sim 1$~PeV, provided that $\sim$10\% of the AGN coronae have $\sigma_{\rm p} \sim 10^5$, while the rest are distributed over a range of lower magnetizations. Coronal emission is suppressed at higher energies by pion and muon cooling, so that another population is required, with jetted AGN being strong candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 Radio surveys of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) allow us to find supercritically accreting compact objects (SS 433/W50 like systems) or stripped nuclear black holes in nearby galaxies. We identified 21 such objects by crossmatching a ULX catalog with the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) and Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). They may have a diverse population. (i) Three have a double lobed radio structure with a compact core found in two of them, and could be quasars. (ii) Five are associated with extended radio structure and star forming regions in optical, where the radio emission is likely due to star forming activities, although the steep radio spectrum up to several GHz casts doubt on that. Two of them show X-ray variability suggesting that they are ULXs embedded in star forming regions. (iii) Thirteen are associated with an unresolved radio source, with a steep spectrum seen in eight, a flat or inverted spectrum seen in two. Those with a steep spectrum are arguably candidates for SS 433/W50 like objects, with radio emission due to optically thin synchrotron radiation in a surrounding jet/wind powered nebula. Remarkable cases include NGC 925 ULX1 and NGC 6946 ULX1, which are associated with an optical nebula. Those with a flat or inverted spectrum could be accreting black holes with a compact jet, while the black hole mass is estimated to be several $10^6 - 10^8$ $M_\odot$ based on the fundamental plane. Redshift measurements are needed to firmly determine the association with their apparent host galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 AGN hosting water megamaser disks enable exceptionally precise geometric determinations of Black Hole (BH) mass, distance, inclination, and dynamical center. In anticipation of upcoming space-based very long baseline Interferometry (SVLBI) missions, megamaser disk AGN offer a uniquely valuable probe of strong-gravity regimes through black hole shadow (BHS) imaging beyond Sgr~A* and M87*. In this work, we (1) map the predicted BHS diameters of twenty-one of the most precisely characterized megamaser disk AGN to submillimeter-millimeter (submm-mm) interferometric baseline requirements, (2) estimate their respective AGN-core flux densities at submm-mm wavelengths, accounting for thermal-dust contamination, extended-jet emission, and intrinsic variability, and (3) determine the astrometric precision required to detect spin-dependent positional offsets between the BHS and the megamaser disk dynamical center. NGC~4258 stands out as the only megamaser disk AGN detectable on Earth-L2 baselines in the submm-mm regime, while other megamaser disk AGN in the sample would require baselines approaching Earth-L4/L5 distances; moreover, only a handful exhibit flux densities above $\sim$10~mJy. Our results further indicate a submillimeter excess in NGC~4258, suggesting that the accretion disk remains thin down to a transitional radius of $\lesssim 100$~Schwarzschild radii, within which the flow becomes advection dominated. For a maximally spinning supermassive black hole in NGC~4258, we show that the astrometric precision of the BHS centroid necessary to detect the BHS-dynamical center offset could, in principle, be achieved with Earth-Moon baselines; however, it would also demand astrometric precision of the water maser dynamical center roughly fifty times better than what is currently attainable.

 - **Abstract**
 The statistical tension between early and late universe measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) suggests that the dark sector is dynamical rather than static. We propose that this dynamics arises from a fundamental symmetry principle: the Spontaneous Breaking of Scale Invariance. We introduce the Dilaton ($\chi$), a Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson (PNGB) associated with dilatation symmetry breaking. We demonstrate that a simple quadratic mass term in the fundamental theory transforms, via conformal coupling to gravity, into a ''thawing'' exponential potential $V(\phi) \propto e^{-\lambda\phi}$ in the Einstein frame. Using recent Bayesian reconstructions of dark energy dynamics from Planck, Pantheon+, and SH0ES data, we constrain the potential slope to be $\lambda \approx 0.056$. We show that this observational value is not arbitrary but corresponds to a fundamental non-minimal coupling strength of $\xi \approx 7.8 \times 10^{-4}$. The Dilaton mechanism naturally generates the late-time equation of state evolution ($w_0 \approx -0.85$) required to alleviate the Hubble tension while protecting the field mass $m \sim H_0$ through approximate shift symmetry.

#### Strangeon Ergostars

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of the central engine powering short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers remains a key open question in the era of multi-messenger astronomy. The ergostar hypothesis, that a rapidly rotating star with an ergoregion drives the relativistic jet, offers an alternative explanation to the black hole-accretion disk paradigm. However, previous studies based on conventional neutron star equations of state (EOSs) have shown that dynamically stable ergostars do not exist unless very extreme EOS or rotation are adopted, casting significant doubt on their astrophysical viability in reality. In this work, however, we examine this hypothesis using a phenomenological EOS of strangeon matter, i.e., condensed matter with nucleon-like units for three flavors of quarks. By constructing a large suite of uniformly rotating equilibrium models, we systematically investigate the parameter space of the stable ergostars and calculate their maximum extractable energy. In contrast to the case of conventional EOSs, we demonstrate that strangeon matter supports a vast and robust parameter space for dynamically stable ergostars, even without requiring differential rotation. We find that the extractable rotational energy from these configurations can be on the order of $0.01 M_\odot$, a reservoir sufficient to power a typical sGRB. Our results revitalize the ergostar as a viable central engine for sGRB, suggesting that BNS merger remnants composed of exotic matter could play a crucial, previously underestimated role in high-energy astrophysics.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory have revealed a significant excess of high-energy neutrinos from nearby Seyfert galaxies, such as NGC~1068, without a corresponding flux of high-energy gamma-rays. This suggests that neutrinos are produced via hadronic interactions in a region opaque to gamma-rays, likely a hot corona surrounding the central supermassive black hole. However, the mechanism responsible for accelerating the parent protons to the required energies ($\sim 100$ TeV) remains an open question. In this study, we investigate diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in active galactic nucleus (AGN) coronae using a suite of one-dimensional Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations spanning a broad range of plasma parameters. We find that DSA is a robust and efficient mechanism for proton acceleration, consistently channeling approximately 10\% of the shock's kinetic energy into non-thermal ions, even for shocks with sonic Mach number as low as $ M_s \approx 2$. In contrast, the efficiency of electron acceleration is highly variable and less efficient ($<1\%$) in our parameter survey. These findings provide strong, first-principles support for the hadronic models of neutrino production in AGN and offer quantitative constraints that can explain the observed gamma-ray deficit.

 - **Abstract**
 The Euclid mission seeks to understand the Universe expansion history and the nature of dark energy, which requires a very accurate estimate of redshift distribution. Achieving this accuracy relies on reference samples with spectroscopic redshifts, together with a procedure to match them to survey sources for which only photometric redshifts are available. One important source of systematic uncertainty is the mismatch in photometric properties between galaxies in the Euclid survey and the reference objects. We develop a method to degrade the photometry of objects with deep photometry to match the properties of any shallower survey in the multi-band photometric space, preserving all the correlations between the fluxes and their uncertainties. We compare our transfer method with more demanding image-based methods, such as Balrog from the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration. According to metrics, our method outperforms Balrog. We implement it in the redshift distribution reconstruction, based on the self-organising map approach of arXiv:1509.03318, and test it using a realistic sample from the Euclid Flagship Simulation. We find that the key ingredient is to ensure that the reference objects are distributed in the colour space the same way as the wide-survey objects, which can be efficiently achieved with our transfer method. In our best implementation, the mean redshift biases are consistently reduced across the tomographic bins, bringing a significant fraction of them within the Euclid accuracy requirements in all tomographic bins. Equally importantly, the tests allow us to pinpoint which step in the calibration pipeline has the strongest impact on achieving the required accuracy. Our approach also reproduces the overall redshift distributions, which are crucial for applications such as angular clustering.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate nonlinear structure formation in Horndeski gravity with a luminal gravitational wave speed ($c_T = 1$) using the spherical collapse model incorporating Vainshtein screening. We compute the critical and virial overdensities and use these to evaluate the halo mass function within several commonly employed formalisms. Building on the reaction method, we develop a flexible and accurate framework for computing the nonlinear matter power spectrum across a broad class of viable modified gravity models within luminal Horndeski theories. The framework interfaces seamlessly with EFTCAMB and is applicable to both covariant Horndeski models and effective field theory descriptions of dark energy, allowing for a range of background cosmologies. This approach enables systematic exploration of a wide space of theories and cosmological parameters, with the goal of informing future analyses of upcoming large-scale structure surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The \(w_{\dagger}\)VCDM framework provides a theoretically well-controlled extension of \(\Lambda\)CDM within the class of minimally modified gravity theories, allowing for flexible cosmological background evolution and linear perturbation dynamics while remaining free of pathological instabilities. In this work, we have shown that this scenario remains robust when confronted with current cosmological observations, even in the presence of an extended neutrino sector. Combining \textit{Planck} CMB data with DESI DR2 BAO and DESY5 supernovae, we obtain stringent constraints on neutrino physics, including \(\sum m_\nu < 0.11~\mathrm{eV}\) (95\% CL) and \(N_{\rm eff} = 2.98^{+0.13}_{-0.14}\), fully consistent with Standard Model expectations. Crucially, the data exhibit a statistically significant preference for a late-time dark-energy transition, characterized by a robust quintessence--phantom crossing that remains stable across all dataset combinations and neutrino-sector extensions, including the presence of a sterile neutrino. The combined effects of modified late-time expansion and additional relativistic degrees of freedom systematically raise the inferred Hubble constant, substantially alleviating the \(H_0\) tension without invoking early dark energy or introducing theoretical instabilities. Overall, the \(w_{\dagger}\)VCDM scenario emerges as a compelling phenomenological framework that simultaneously accommodates current constraints on neutrino physics, provides an excellent fit to recent BAO and supernovae data, and offers a viable pathway toward resolving persistent tensions in the standard cosmological model.

#### Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion onto ultra dense dark matter halos and direct collapse black holes

 - **Abstract**
 We suggest a formation scenario of black holes with intermediate mass $\sim 10^3 M_\odot$, by post recombination Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion into ultra dense dark matter halos (UDMH) of $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$, which have formed around the recombination epoch. Such UDMH can result from rare curvature fluctuations on small scales whose amplitude is still well below the current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectral distortion limits. Gas accreted by the UDMH is heated to virial temperatures above which atomic cooling is efficient, cools rapidly to about $\sim 8000$ K and collapses on the free fall time of few $10^4$ yr to the halo core, until supported by rotation. Further fragmentation due to molecular cooling is prevented by the suppression of $H_2$ molecule formation by the CMB photons at redshifts $z> 200-400$. We find that the rotationally supported gas disk will be compact and massive enough to undergo self-gravitational instability in some cases, plausibly where accretion is into a nearly spherical UDMH which has formed from a rare peak in the density field. This results in a further, rapid transfer of mass inwards due to viscous forces and gravitational torques leading to the formation of a supermassive star and/or black hole of about $10^3 M_\odot$ at redshifts of a few hundred, with abundances comparable to galaxies. Such intermediate mass black holes formed at high redshifts can seed the first super massive black holes and help explain the abundance of active galaxies detected now at increasingly larger redshifts by the James Webb Space Telescope.

 - **Abstract**
 Binaries of supermassive black holes (MBHBs) represent the primary sources of the gravitational wave background (GWB) detectable by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). The eccentricity with which binaries form in galactic mergers is the key parameter determining their evolutionary timescale from pairing to coalescence. However, accurately determining the binary eccentricity at formation is difficult in simulations due to stochastic effects. We present a numerical study of the formation and evolution of MBHBs that are potential PTA sources. We simulate mergers of equal-mass galaxies on different initial orbits and follow the dynamics of the MBHBs through the hardening phase. We find that low-resolution simulations are affected by stochasticity due to torques from the stellar distribution acting at pericentre passages. The dispersion in binary eccentricity decreases with increasing central resolution, as expected for a Poisson process. We provide a fitting formula for the resolution requirement of an N-body simulation of MBHB formation and evolution as a function of the initial eccentricity of the merger, e0, and the required accuracy in the binary eccentricity, eb. We find that binaries experience a torque at first pericentre that is approximately independent of initial eccentricity, producing a general trend in which the binary eccentricity decreases above sufficiently large initial orbital eccentricities. While this behaviour is generic, the precise cross-over eccentricity (e0~0.97 in our models) and the sharpness of the drop-off depend on the galaxy initial conditions. We provide a fitting formula for eb(e0) that can be used in semi-analytical models to determine the merger timescales of MBHBs as well as the amplitude and slope of the GWB.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the late-time cosmological dynamics of a two-field dark energy model consisting of a canonical quintessence scalar field and a phantom scalar field in a spatially flat FLRW universe. The fields are minimally coupled to gravity and uncoupled at the level of the potential, with the quintessence sector governed by an exponential potential and the phantom sector by an inverse power-law potential. By reformulating the background equations as a five-dimensional autonomous dynamical system, we identify and analyze the fixed points and their stability properties, revealing stable late-time attractors corresponding to phantom-dominated accelerated expansion. We confront the model with observations through a Bayesian parameter estimation performed using the \textsc{Cobaya} framework, employing several combinations of recent cosmological data sets, including Pantheon+ supernovae, compressed cosmic microwave background distance priors, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and DES Year-5 supernova data. The observational constraints favor a dynamical dark energy sector moderately and are consistent with deviations from a cosmological constant at the present epoch. The regions of parameter space preferred by the data are compatible with the stable accelerating solutions identified in the dynamical analysis, establishing a direct connection between phase-space stability and observational viability. A notable feature of the model is that the effective dark energy equation of state undergoes phantom divide crossing in a gradual and asymptotic manner, rather than as a sharp transition.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a comprehensive search for high-velocity X-ray sources with large X-ray/optical flux ratios ($F_\mathrm{X}/F_\mathrm{G}$), identifying candidates for interacting black hole or neutron star binaries potentially accelerated by supernova natal kicks. We cross-match X-ray points sources from a variety of catalogues (Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift and eROSITA) with Gaia DR3. Using Gaia coordinates, parallaxes, and proper motions, we compute peculiar velocities ($\upsilon_\mathrm{pec}$) relative to Galactic disc rotation. Remaining agnostic about radial velocities (RVs), we vary RVs to find the minimum possible $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec}$ values ($\upsilon_\mathrm{pec, min}$). Uncertainties on $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec, min}$ are estimated via Monte Carlo resampling, and we select X-ray sources that have $1\,\sigma$ lower limits on $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec, min}\geq 200\,\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ and high $F_\mathrm{X}/F_\mathrm{G}$ values. We show that this velocity threshold excludes most contaminants (e.g., cataclysmic variables and active binaries) while retaining a sensible fraction of compact object binaries, demonstrating that $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec}$ could serve as an effective indicator for the presence of a neutron star or black hole companion. Our selection yields a sample of 2372 sources, from which we construct a gold sample of 7 sources that have relatively well-constrained astrometry and confident optical counterparts. Follow-up is necessary to confirm and characterise their high-energy emission, as well as a Galactic disc vs. halo origin.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. A lot of recent studies have focused on the observables associated with near merger binary black-holes (BBHs) embedded in a circumbinary disk (CBD) but we still we lack knowledge of observables of BBHs in their early stage. In that stage the separation between the two black holes is so large that both black holes could potentially retain their individual accretion disk existing before the creation of the BBH. For such early BBH systems, it is interesting to look for observables originating in those individual disks whose structure is likely to differ from mini-disks often observed in simulations of later stages of BBHs. Aims. In a companion paper we presented a set of hydrodynamical simulations of an individual disk surrounding a primary black hole while being impacted by the presence of a secondary black-hole in an early BBH system, leading to the creation of three well-known characteristic features in the disk's structure. Here we explore the imprints of these three features on the observables associated with the thermal emission of the pre-existing black hole disk. The aim is two-fold, first to see which observables are best suited for detecting those early systems and, secondly, what could be extrapolated about these systems from observations. Methods. We used general relativistic ray-tracing in order to produce synthetic observations of the thermal emission emitted by early BBHs with different mass ratio and separations in order to search for distinctive observational features of early systems. Results. We found that in the case of early BBH with pre-existing disk(s) a necessary, although not unique, observational feature is the truncation of their disk(s). Conclusions. Such observable could be used for automated search of potential BBHs and discriminate some existing candidates.

 - **Abstract**
 In a recent paper we pointed out that supermassive black holes, with masses ranging from $10^5$ to $10^{10} M_\odot$ form naturally at cosmic dawn if the dark matter is QCD axions or axion-like particles with mass $m > 10^{-16}\, \mathrm{eV}/c^2$. No additional assumptions are required. Here we answer in detail the most commonly raised questions regarding our work.

 - **Abstract**
 We determine the metric of a Kerr black hole subject to external tidal fields using metric reconstruction techniques. Working within the Newman-Penrose formalism, we solve the Teukolsky master equation for static, quadrupolar modes associated with a slowly varying tidal environment, and reconstruct the corresponding metric perturbation in the outgoing radiation gauge. As an application, we derive the secular Hamiltonian governing the motion of a test particle in the tidally deformed Kerr spacetime and investigate long-term tidal effects relevant to extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. In particular, we compute tidal-induced shifts of the innermost stable circular orbit and the light ring. We find that these tidal corrections are strongly spin dependent, with significantly larger effects for retrograde orbits around rapidly rotating black holes. Our results provide a fully analytic framework for studying tidal interactions and secular dynamics in rotating black-hole spacetimes, with direct applications to gravitational-wave modeling and tests of gravity in the strong-field regime.

 - **Abstract**
 We estimate the parameters of several astrophysical black holes hosted at the core of active galactic nuclei by studying the kinematics of test objects in their accretion disk. We derive an expression for the redshift of photons emitted by a massive particle circularly orbiting a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, and detected by a distant receding observer. The redshift depends on the mass and distance of the black hole, the orbital radius of the photon source, as well as the Hubble constant, directly relating these quantities to astrophysical observables, namely, the redshift and the angular position of the test particle on the sky. We apply for the first time this theoretical model, which accounts for the universe expansion through the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, to real astrophysical systems using megamaser galaxies within the Hubble flow. Bayesian inference based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods is employed to estimate the black hole mass, its distance, the angular position of the emitter, and the Hubble constant, for which a Gaussian prior is assumed. Our results introduce a general relativistic framework to take the contribution of cosmic expansion into account that differs from the standard empirical Hubble law.

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a fully gauge invariant analysis of gravitational wave polarizations in metric f(R) gravity with a particular focus on the modified Starobinsky model, whose constant curvature solution provides a natural deSitter background for both early and late time cosmology. Linearizing the field equations around this background, we derive the Klein Gordon equation for the curvature perturbation and show that the scalar propagating mode acquires a mass, highlighting how the same scalar degree of freedom governs inflationary dynamics at high curvature and the propagation of gravitational waves in the current accelerating Universe. Using the scalar vector tensor (SVT) decomposition and a decomposition of the perturbed Ricci tensor, we obtain a set of fully gauge invariant propagation equations that isolate the contributions of the scalar, vector, and tensor modes in the presence of matter. We find that the tensor sector retains the two transverse traceless polarizations of General Relativity, while the scalar sector supports a massive breathing-longitudinal mode determined by the massive scalar propagating mode. Through the geodesic deviation equation, computed both in a local Minkowski patch and in fully covariant de Sitter form, we independently recover the same polarization content and identify its tidal signatures. The resulting framework connects the extra scalar polarization to cosmological observables, providing a unified, gauge invariant link between gravitational wave phenomenology and the cosmological implications of metric f(R) gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the repetitive Penrose process in accelerating Kerr black holes and explores the influence of the acceleration factor on the repetitive Penrose process. After a brief review of accelerating Kerr black holes, we study the fundamental equations of the Penrose process in this spacetime, examine the stopping conditions required for the repetitive Penrose process, and obtain corresponding numerical results. The conclusions indicate that, apart from the third law of thermodynamics similar to previous cases, accelerating Kerr black holes exhibit stronger energy extraction capabilities compared to Kerr black holes during the repetitive Penrose process. Moreover, in prior studies, the energy utilization efficiency was difficult to exceed $50\%$. However, in accelerating Kerr black holes, when the decay radius is relatively small, the energy utilization efficiency can exceed $50\%$, indicating that the reduced extractable energy primarily transforms into extracted energy rather than irreducible mass. On the other hand, when the initial value of the acceleration factor is large, the extractable energy can decrease to nearly zero, which also differs from the case of Kerr black holes in previous studies.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we derive a universal upper bound for the photon sphere radius in static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes of arbitrary dimension $n\ge 4$, in the presence of an anisotropic matter field satisfying the weak energy condition and a non-positive trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Using the effective potential method, we obtain the bound $r_\gamma\le [(n-1)M]^{\frac{1}{n-3}}$, where $M$ is the ADM mass of the black hole. This bound reduces to $r_\gamma\le 3M$ in four dimensions, consistent with the known result in the literature. Our result provides a dimension-dependent upper bound for photon spheres and deepens the understanding of spacetime structure in higher-dimensional gravitational theories.

 A quantum description of dust cores for black hole geometries can be obtained by quantising the geodesic motion of dust particles and finding the corresponding many-body ground state.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study the electric Penrose energy extraction for charged particles in the spacetime of a covariant quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordström black hole. We first derive the equations of motion and effective potential for charged particles around the black hole. Subsequently, we investigate the Penrose process for such particles, analyze how the generalized ergoregion boundary is influenced by the particle's charge, angular momentum, and the quantum parameter $\zeta$, and calculate the energy-extraction efficiency. We then investigate the subsequent motion of charged particles in the electric Penrose process, and rigorously prove that under specific simplified conditions, the resulting fragment particle can always carry more energy back to a distant observer--a conclusion applicable to a wide range of charged black hole models. Finally, we examine a special class of the electric Penrose process, wherein the initial particle cannot escape the black hole, but the high-energy fragment produced through splitting may still escape successfully. Moreover, it is observed that $\zeta$ slightly alters the particle trajectories, but under specific initial conditions, it can qualitatively change the outcome: a particle that escapes in the classical Reissner-Nordström black hole spacetime may become trapped in the quantum-corrected one. These results demonstrate the obstructive effect of quantum corrections on the Penrose process and provide potential kinematic signatures to distinguish quantum-corrected from classical Reissner-Nordström black holes.

 We give a simple construction of smooth, asymptotically flat vacuum initial data modeling a relativistic collapsing $N$--body system, with independently prescribed ADM energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum for each component, subject to the timelike condition $\E>|¶|$. The initial data contain no trapped surfaces, and the future development contains multiple causally independent trapped regions that dynamically form from localized subsets of the initial slice. In particular, the maximal development of data with well-separated collapsing components and relative motion is expected to yield spacetimes containing multiple black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the observational signatures of a static, spherically symmetric black hole embedded in a spontaneous Kalb-Ramond (KR) background. By normalizing the solution to the physically observable mass $M_{\text{phys}}$, we demonstrate that the thermodynamics of the KR black hole are consistent with General Relativity, with no deviations in the entropy-area law. However, the Lorentz-violating parameter $l$ induces distinct geometric effects: it suppresses the optical shadow radius by a factor of $\sqrt{1-l}$ and hardens the quasinormal mode frequency by the inverse factor. Utilizing Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data for Sagittarius A*, and assuming the mass prior derived from stellar dynamics, we place a constraint of $l \lesssim 0.19$. While the product of the shadow radius and ringdown frequency remains degenerate with General Relativity, the specific suppression of the shadow size offers a viable pathway to constrain Planck-scale physics with current and future horizon-scale imaging.

#### Exact solutions of the FLRW cosmological model via invariants of the Hamilton-Jacobi method

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we proceed to solve the field equations of the spatially flat Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological model in the presence of the cosmological constant \(\Lambda\) by making use of the Invariants of Hamilton-Jacobi method (IHJM). This method enables us to extract systematically two independent first integrals such as \(l_{\rm HJ,1}(a,\dot{a})=c_{1}\) and \(l_{\rm HJ,2}(t,a,\dot{a})=c_{2}\) associated to the transformations group keeping the form of the Hamilton's canonical equations (HCEs) of the cosmological model invariant. Extracting these invariants means not only finding the general solution of the field equations of the model, but also obtaining the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian functions for the model whose dynamics acts like the dynamics of a single particle in a one-dimensional mini-super space \(\mathbb{Q}=(a)\). In addition, to obtain the general solution of the model, the IHJM have also solved the inverse problem of calculus of variation (IPCV) without resorting to Helmholtz conditions and whether the necessary conditions for the existence of the Lagrangian function are hold or not. The main part of the IHJM is to find the generating function of the canonical transformation (CT) and then extract two independent invariants for the desired model by using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE). This study shows that there is a close relationship between the group of the CTs of the Hamiltonian function of the particle and the one-parameter Lie group of transformations keeping invariant the Einstein-Friedmann dynamical equation (EFDE) \(\ddot{a}=F(a,\dot{a})\), so that both of them lead to the same result. In this way, having both the IHJM and the invariants of the symmetry groups method (ISGM), a comprehensive integration theory by unifying them can be achieved for studying the desired models.

#### Shadow of a circular disformal Kerr black hole beyond GR

 - **Abstract**
 We have studied the shadows of a circular disformal Kerr black hole with a deformation parameter, which represents a rotating solution within a generalized scalar-tensor framework of Horndeski gravity that characterized by second-order field equations. Our result show that for the non-rotating case, the shadow remains perfectly circular, with its radius independent of the deformation parameter. For the rotating case, the size of the shadow decreases as the deformation parameter decreases, and the shape of the shadow gradually becomes more flattened. It is worth noting that while the shadow of a rotating black hole remains north-south symmetric for equatorial observers, this symmetry is broken once the observer moves away from the equatorial plane. For an observer in the northern hemisphere, the geometric center of the shadow shifts northward when $D_0<0$ and southward when $D_0>0$, while the opposite behavior occurs for observers in the southern hemisphere. These features in the black hole shadow originating from the scalar field could help us to understand the circular disformal Kerr black hole and generalized scalar-tensor framework of Horndeski gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 In the present work, we numerically investigate the horizon structure of the Kerr-Sen black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. Further, we investigate the phase transitions and critical phenomena in Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes at the critical points. Such black holes are characterized by its mass ($M$), the dilaton charge ($Q$), and the negative cosmological constant, $\Lambda(<0)$. We define a dimensionless parameter $\epsilon=\bar{J}/{\bar{Q}^2}$ and express the mass, temperature, volume, and Gibbs free energy in terms of $\epsilon$ and its polynomials. Moreover, we numerically fit the data for the critical points and find that in the appropriate limit, the expressions for critical points would correspond to the respective critical points of the Kerr-AdS black hole thermodynamics. Such a study involves a systematic analysis of temperature, Gibbs free energy, and volume in the extended phase space. We provide an analytical verification of the nature of the phase transitions at the critical points by introducing the Ehrenfest equations. We also check that all three quantities, e.g., the specific heat at constant pressure, $C_P$, the volume expansion coefficient, $\alpha$, and the isothermal compressibility, $\kappa_T$, diverge at the critical points. We find the $Prigogine$-$Defay$ ratio using the expressions of $C_P$, $\alpha$, and $\kappa_T$, and find that it identically equals unity. Hence, the phase transition behavior of the Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes at their critical points is of second order. In addition, we propose investigating the energy extraction process via the Penrose process. Later, we calculate the speed of sound and adiabatic compressibility for the rotating Kerr-Sen-AdS black holes. Finally, on a specific note, we calculate the thermodynamic quantities of the boundary conformal field theory (CFT) dual to the extended phase space.

#### Regular Black Holes in Quasitopological Gravity: Null Shells and Mass Inflation

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the phenomenon of mass inflation in the interior of regular black holes arising in quasitopological gravity (QTG). These geometries are characterized by a bounded curvature core and the presence of an inner (Cauchy) horizon located near the fundamental scale $\ell$. To examine whether mass inflation persists in this setting, we model the interaction of ingoing and outgoing perturbations by considering the collision of two spherical null shells inside the black hole. Using the Dray-'t\,Hooft-Barrabes-Israel junction condition, we derive conditions under which the metric function and curvature invariants may experience significant amplification near the inner horizon. Our analysis shows that, unlike in classical Reissner--Nordström or Kerr geometries, significant mass inflation requires shell intersection at radii very close to the horizon, with radial separations from it of the order $r-r_* \lesssim \ell \big(\ell/r_g\big)^{2n(D-3)}$, where $r_g$ is the gravitational radius of the black hole, $D$ is the number of spacetime dimensions and $n\ge 1$ is a parameter depending on a concrete QTG model. For macroscopic black holes with $r_g\gg \ell$ this distance is much smaller than the fundamental scale $\ell$. We discuss possible consequences of this effect.

 Where does what happens happen in a quantum system? The standard textbook formulation of quantum mechanics provides a strange, imprecise and yet successful-in-practice answer to this question. In the struggle to unify our understanding of gravity with quantum theory, though, the textbook answer no longer suffices, and an alternative approach is needed. The Feynman Sum Over Histories approach provides an alternative that is particularly suited to quantum gravity because the Sum Over Histories and General Relativity are built on the same fundamental concepts of `event' and `history'.

 - **Abstract**
 The light deflection under a strong gravitational field, referred to as strong gravitational lensing, provides a powerful probe of spacetime geometry. Besides, laboratory analogue models are employed to study the effects of curved spacetime and explore the design of optical devices. Here, applying the framework of analogue gravity, we reveal the behavior of the optical echo from a pulsed point-like source near a black hole, which is strongly dependent on the interplay of the black hole's photon sphere and the source's duration. We model the Schwarzschild spacetime as a Flamm paraboloid and calculate the echo response, using analytical geodesic solutions and the Huygens-Fresnel principle. Particularly, when the spatial scale of pulse duration is comparable to the photon sphere, continuous ``echo tails" appear along bright interference fringes in temporal response. Analysis in both the temporal and frequency domains reveals that these echo tails are a signature of resonance between the incoming pulse and the photon sphere. This work provides a wave-optics perspective on the interaction between dynamic sources and black holes, offering a table top window on strong gravitational lensing.

 - **Abstract**
 The no-short hair theorem for static spherically symmetric black holes in general theory of relativity asserts that if a black hole has hair, that hair must extend beyond the lowest photon sphere radius of the black hole. This report generalizes the theorem to various extra-dimensional cases of black holes and wormholes in post-Einstein gravity and shows how the observational satisfaction of the no-short hair theorem may lead to a probe for the existence of extra-dimensions. We also show how we may lead to argue that this no-short hair theorem is satisfied for black holes in theories of quantum gravity that naturally precludes extra-dimensional cases, like string theory.

 - **Abstract**
 In black hole perturbation theory, the difficulty in separating electromagnetic and gravitational sectors of the coupled Teukolsky equations has prevented a general treatment of scattering processes involving both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves in presence of a Kerr-Newman black hole. We present the first computation of the gauge-invariant, low-frequency scattering amplitude for graviton photoproduction by a Kerr-Newman black hole at tree level up to $\mathcal{O}\big((\omega/m)^2\big)$ or $\mathcal{O}(S^2)$ and linear in $\kappa$, using the worldline effective field theory. The relevant Wilson coefficients are determined by matching the graviton and photon one-point functions to the Kerr-Newman solution. We obtain the full angular dependence of the conversion cross section in the presence of spin and comment on the factorization relation between the graviton photoproduction amplitude and the photon Compton amplitude for a classical spinning source. The result provides a benchmark for future analyses of coupled gravitoelectromagnetic scattering in spinning charged compact object backgrounds.

 - **Abstract**
 A nontrivial peculiarity of general relativity is that when the horizon region of black holes is rendered harmless, the exterior doubles, resulting in a causally disconnected parallel universe. This intricacy plays a central role in 't Hooft's unitarity arguments, emphasising an exact identification between the physical universe and its duplicate on the other side of the horizon. However, it leads to another tension in the form of a factor of two correction in Hawking's temperature. This discrepancy is concerning because the Rindler temperature is universal and complies with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We demonstrate that the mismatch in the Boltzmann factor gets fixed if the state that forms the corresponding density matrix adopts a generalised thermofield double structure. That leaves room for some interesting discussion.

 - **Abstract**
 Features of the black hole interior can be extracted from the analytic structure of boundary correlation functions. Working in the geodesic approximation, we find analytic continuations that probe the interior of rotating and charged black holes. These generate contributions from timelike geodesics that thread the interior and emerge in a future universe. We implement these continuations on the momentum space two-point function and exemplify this in several black hole backgrounds. We also identify position space analytic continuations achieving the same task that incorporate different continued momentum space correlators. These correspond to non-perturbative corrections to the WKB approximation. We demonstrate this explicitly in the rotating BTZ black hole by showing that the interior geodesics contribute to the continued position space correlator and motivate a picture for how these contributions arise in higher dimensions. For AdS Schwarzschild, we identify the analytically continued solution that captures the bouncing geodesic. We discuss the possibility of using these continuations to probe the instability of inner horizons from the boundary.
