 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (\textit{JWST}) opened a new observational window on the primordial Universe. Here we present new JWST NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy (IFS) observations of the $z=7.54$ quasar ULAS J1342+0928 obtained as part of the Galaxy Assembly with NIRSpec IFS (GA-NIFS) GTO programme. The new data-set obtained with both the prism ($R\sim100$) and the high-resolution grating ($R\sim2700$) allow for a complete description of the quasar emission from the rest-frame UV to optical bands. The low-resolution data reveal the presence of [\ion{O}{iii}] emission on $\sim$7 kpc scales, well above the typical galaxy size at this redshift, likely associated with a past outflow event. Additionally, the high-resolution observations show a more energetic ionised outflow on nuclear scales ($\lesssim 0.6$ kpc). The total ionised mass outflow rate ranges between 50 and 300 $\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$ where the significant spread is mostly due to the lack of tight constraints on the electron density. This range overlaps in part with the star formation rate range (85--545 $\rm M_{\odot} \, yr^{-1}$), implying that the nuclear outflow could ultimately lead to an early star formation quenching. By employing an accretion disc modelling, for the first time on \textit{JWST} data, we manage to robustly estimate the black hole mass and the bolometric luminosity, $\rm \log(M_{BH}/(M_{\odot}))=9.2\pm 0.2$ and $\rm \log(L_{bol}/(erg \, s^{-1}))=46.8\pm 0.1$, respectively. We derive an Eddington ratio of $\rm \lambda_{Edd}\sim 0.4$, challenging the paradigm of widespread super-Eddington accretion in quasars at the epoch of reionisation.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent imaging of supermassive black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has relied on exhaustive parameter-space searches, matching observations to large, precomputed libraries of theoretical models. As observational data become increasingly precise, the limitations of this computationally expensive approach grow more acute, creating a pressing need for more efficient methods. In this work, we present $\texttt{Jipole}$, an automatically differentiable (AD), $\texttt{ipole}$-based code for radiative transfer in curved spacetimes, designed to compute image gradients with respect to underlying model parameters. These gradients quantify how parameter changes-such as the black hole's spin or the observer's inclination-affect the image, enabling more efficient parameter estimation and reducing the number of required images. We validate $\texttt{Jipole}$ against $\texttt{ipole}$ in two analytical tests and then compare pixel-wise intensity derivatives from AD with those from finite-difference methods. We then demonstrate the utility of these gradients by performing parameter recovery for an analytical model using a conjugate gradient optimizer in three increasingly complex cases for the injected image: ideal, blurred, and blurred with added noise. In most cases, high-accuracy fits are obtained in only a few optimization steps, failing only in cases with extremely low signal-to-noise ratios and large blurring size kernels. These results highlight the potential of AD-based methods to accelerate robust, high-fidelity model-data comparisons in current and future black hole imaging efforts.

#### Micro-Tidal Disruption Events in Young Star Clusters

 - **Abstract**
 Dense young star clusters (YSCs) are ideal environments for dynamical interactions between stars and stellar mass black holes (BHs). In such dense environments, stars can undergo close encounters with BHs and fall within their tidal radius, resulting in micro-tidal disruption events (micro-TDEs), transient phenomena with potential multi-messenger signatures. We performed a suite of direct N-body simulations using the PETAR code, to which we implemented new prescriptions for modeling micro-TDEs. We constructed a set of realistic YSC models including primordial binaries, based on the observed Milky Way population. Our simulations incorporate stellar and binary evolution, supernova kicks, and stellar winds using the BSE code, and account for the Galactic tidal field via the GALPY library. We identify three dynamical channels for micro-TDE production: single star-single BH encounters, binary-mediated interactions (including supernova-kick triggers), and interactions involving higher-order multiple systems such as hierarchical triples and quadruples, as well as chaotic few-body interactions. Multiple encounters are the most efficient production channel, which dominates the total rate: 350-450 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. Micro-TDEs from YSCs are expected to be detectable by upcoming surveys, particularly the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, with detection rates potentially up to hundreds per year. The gravitational wave (GW) signals expected from micro-TDEs peak in the deci-Hertz band, making them accessible to future instruments such as the Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna and the Deci-Hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Micro-TDEs emerge as promising multi-messenger sources, potentially offering unique insights into star cluster dynamics, stellar collisions, and the population of dormant stellar-mass BHs, through both electromagnetic and GW observations.

 - **Abstract**
 With pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) having observed a gravitational wave background (GWB) at nanohertz frequencies, the focus of the field is shifting towards determining and characterizing its origin. While the primary candidate is a population of GW-emitting supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), many other cosmological processes could produce a GWB with similar spectral properties as have been measured. One key argument to help differentiate an SMBHB GWB from a cosmologically sourced one is its level of anisotropy; a GWB sourced by a finite population will likely exhibit greater anisotropy than a cosmological GWB through finite source effects (``shot noise'') and potentially large-scale structure. Current PTA GWB anisotropy detection methods often use the frequentist PTA optimal statistic for its fast estimation of pulsar pair correlations and relatively low computational overhead compared to spatially-correlated Bayesian analyses. However, there are critical limitations with the status quo approach. In this paper, we improve this technique by incorporating three recent advancements: accounting for covariance between pulsar pairwise estimates of correlated GWB power; the per-frequency optimal statistic to dissect the GWB across the spectrum; and constructing null-hypothesis statistical distributions that include cosmic variance. By combining these methods, our new pipeline can localize GWB anisotropies to specific frequencies, through which anisotropy detection prospects -- while impacted by cosmic variance -- are shown to improve in our simulations from a $p$-value of $\sim0.2$ in a broadband search to $\sim0.01$ in the per-frequency search. Our methods are already incorporated in community-available code and ready to deploy on forthcoming PTA datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 We utilize the Magneticum suite of hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the formation and evolution of cosmic voids from $z = 5.04$ to present day, using cold dark matter and (sub-) halo tracers in high-density samples. This includes the evolution of their global properties, such as size, shape, inner density, and average density, as well as their radial density profiles. Our results provide several key conclusions for void analyses in modern surveys. We demonstrate that a relative size framework is required, mitigating methodological selection effects and revealing the true physical evolution of densities around halo-defined voids. This necessity arises from our findings that a void's properties are more fundamentally tied to its rank within its contemporary population than to its absolute size. Using this framework, we show that the evolution of halo voids stabilizes at redshifts below $z \simeq 1$, driven primarily by cosmic expansion rather than ongoing halo formation. We further find that the matter evolution around these stable voids is remarkably well-described by linear growth theory, with deviations appearing as non-linear growth on small scales and suppressed growth in the largest voids, potentially driven by the influence of dark energy. This late-time stability and the predictable evolution confirm voids as pristine laboratories for probing the nature of dark energy with upcoming surveys.

#### AGN-heated dust revealed in "Little Red Dots"

 - **Abstract**
 Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a puzzling population of extragalactic sources whose origin is highly debated. In this Letter, we stack NIRCam, MIRI and ALMA images of a large and homogeneously-selected sample of LRDs from multiple JWST Legacy fields. We find clear evidence for hot-dust emission, seen as a rising mid-infrared continuum up to rest-frame $\lambda_{\rm rest}$$\sim$ 3$\mu$m, that is best explained by a standard dusty AGN structure. This scenario holds regardless of whether the Optical/Ultraviolet (UV) continuum is stellar or AGN-dominated. Either ways, we argue that AGN-heated dust must have a geometry that leaves at least part of the Optical/UV continuum and broad-line region emission unobscured, which explains the observed blue UV slopes and prominent Balmer features. Lack of detections in the deep stack of X-ray images suggests that Compton-thick ($N_{\rm H}$$>$3$\times$10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) gas obscuration is common, and likely confined within the dust sublimation radius ($R$$_{\rm sub}$$\sim$0.1 pc). While this gas-dust displacement is in line with recent models (e.g. the ``Black Hole Star''), how pre-enriched hot dust can form around a nearly-pristine black hole environment remains to be explained.

 - **Abstract**
 Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers achieve optimal sensitivity for dark matter in the $10$--$1000~\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ mass range, but sub-GeV dark matter particles lack sufficient energy to produce nuclear recoils above detection thresholds in these detectors. Blazar-boosted dark matter offers a way to overcome this limitation: relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei can accelerate light dark matter in their host-galaxy halos to energies capable of producing detectable nuclear recoil signals in xenon-based detectors on Earth. We present the first blazar-boosted dark matter search incorporating detector response modeling, using public data from XENON1T and LZ for the blazar TXS~0506+056. We model dark matter--proton scattering in the jet environment, covering the full process from jet acceleration to detector response. We explore how the host-galaxy dark matter density profile impacts our analysis. Using XENON1T data, we exclude dark matter--nucleon cross sections for $m_\chi \sim 1~\mathrm{MeV}$ in the range $5.8\times 10^{-31}~\mathrm{cm^2} \lesssim \sigma_{\chi n} \lesssim 6.3\times 10^{-29}~\mathrm{cm^2}$, and using LZ EFT searches we constrain $9.9\times 10^{-32}~\mathrm{cm^2} \lesssim \sigma_{\chi n} \lesssim 2.5\times 10^{-28}~\mathrm{cm^2}$. Our results show that astrophysical uncertainties, especially the dark matter density profile near the supermassive black hole, set the primary limitation on the sensitivity rather than detector systematics. These findings highlight blazar-boosted dark matter as a promising probe of light dark matter and motivate further astrophysical modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide a ground-breaking data set for cosmology, but to achieve the precision needed, the data, data reduction, and algorithms measuring the cosmological data vectors must be thoroughly validated and calibrated. In this note, we focus on clusters of galaxies and present a set of validation tests for optical cluster finding algorithms through comparison to X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect cluster catalogs. As an example, we apply our pipeline to compare the performance of the redMaPPer (red-sequence Matched filter Probabilistic Percolation) and WaZP (Wavelet Z Photometric) cluster finding algorithms on Dark Energy Survey (DES) data.

 - **Abstract**
 As photometric surveys reach unprecedented statistical precision, systematic uncertainties increasingly dominate large-scale structure probes relying on galaxy number density. Defining the final survey footprint is critical, as it excludes regions affected by artefacts or suboptimal observing conditions. For galaxy clustering, spatially varying observational systematics, such as seeing, are a leading source of bias. Template maps of contaminants are used to derive spatially dependent corrections, but extreme values may fall outside the applicability range of mitigation methods, compromising correction reliability. The complexity and accuracy of systematics modelling depend on footprint conservativeness, with aggressive masking enabling simpler, robust mitigation. We present a unified approach to define the DES Year 6 joint footprint, integrating observational systematics templates and artefact indicators that degrade mitigation performance. This removes extreme values from an initial seed footprint, leading to the final joint footprint. By evaluating the DES Year 6 lens sample MagLim++ plus plus on this footprint, we enhance the Iterative Systematics Decontamination (ISD) method, detecting non-linear systematic contamination and improving correction accuracy. While the mask's impact on clustering is less significant than systematics decontamination, it remains non-negligible, comparable to statistical uncertainties in certain w(theta) scales and redshift bins. Supporting coherent analyses of galaxy clustering and cosmic shear, the final footprint spans 4031.04 deg2, setting the basis for DES Year 6 1x2pt, 2x2pt, and 3x2pt analyses. This work highlights how targeted masking strategies optimise the balance between statistical power and systematic control in Stage-III and -IV surveys.

#### Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Redshift Calibration of the MagLim++ Lens Sample

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we derive and calibrate the redshift distribution of the MagLim++ lens galaxy sample used in the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 (DES Y6) 3x2pt cosmology analysis. The 3x2pt analysis combines galaxy clustering from the lens galaxy sample and weak gravitational lensing. The redshift distributions are inferred using the SOMPZ method - a Self-Organizing Map framework that combines deep-field multi-band photometry, wide-field data, and a synthetic source injection (Balrog) catalog. Key improvements over the DES Year 3 (Y3) calibration include a noise-weighted SOM metric, an expanded Balrog catalogue, and an improved scheme for propagating systematic uncertainties, which allows us to generate O($10^8$) redshift realizations that collectively span the dominant sources of uncertainty. These realizations are then combined with independent clustering-redshift measurements via importance sampling. The resulting calibration achieves typical uncertainties on the mean redshift of 1-2%, corresponding to a 20-30% average reduction relative to DES Y3. We compress the $n(z)$ uncertainties into a small number of orthogonal modes for use in cosmological inference. Marginalizing over these modes leads to only a minor degradation in cosmological constraints. This analysis establishes the MagLim++ sample as a robust lens sample for precision cosmology with DES Y6 and provides a scalable framework for future surveys.

#### Early warning for lensed gravitational wave counterparts from time delays of their host galaxies observed in the optical

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) can be leveraged to provide early-warning times of $\mathcal{O}({\rm hours})$ to $\mathcal{O}({\rm days})$ before the merger of Binary Neutron Stars (BNSs) and Neutron Star Black Holes (NSBHs). This in turn could enable electromagnetic (EM) telescopes to capture emissions surrounding the time of the merger. In this work, we assess the practicability of lensing-driven early-warning by analysing optical images of the lensed host galaxy to predict the arrival time of subsequent BNS/NSBH signals following the observation of the first signal. We produce mock lenses with image quality and resolution similar to images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the ground-based Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) on the Subaru telescope. We compare the time delay uncertainties between these two cases for typical lensed image configurations and multiplicity. These include doubles and quads, and among quads: the fold, cusp, cross image configurations. We find that time delay uncertainties for doubles are comparable for both HST and HSC mocks. On the other hand, quads tend to provide accurate time-delay predictions (typical relative error $\sim0.1$) with HST. Analysis of a real lens led to a difference in time-delay estimates of $\mathcal{O}(\rm days)$ between the predictions derived from HST and HSC data. Our work therefore strongly advocates the need for high-resolution EM observations of lensed host galaxies to feasibly enable lensing-driven early-warning.

 - **Abstract**
 The behavior of black hole horizons under extreme conditions-such as near collapse or phase transitions-remains less understood, particularly in the context of soft hair and Aretakis instabilities. We show that the breakdown of conformal symmetry during the balding phase induces a topological reorganization of the horizon, leading to divergent entropy corrections and emergent pressure terms. These corrections exhibit universal scaling laws, analogous to quantum phase transitions in condensed matter systems, with extremal limits functioning as quantum critical points. Interestingly, by employing quasi-equilibrium boundary conditions, one could stabilize horizon dynamics without explicitly introducing ad hoc higher-order corrections, further limiting the universal applicability of conformal invariance in black hole physics.

 - **Abstract**
 An accelerated charge interacts with itself through the electromagnetic field that it sources, a phenomenon known as electromagnetic radiation reaction. The DeWitt-Brehme-Hobbs (DWBH) equation describes the motion of a charged mass in the presence of combined electromagnetic and gravitational fields, taking into account electromagnetic radiation-reaction effects. Here, we find the first exact analytical solution of the DWBH equation in the case of a charged mass in the presence of copropagating and otherwise arbitrary electromagnetic and gravitational plane waves. Apart from its intrinsic importance, this solution approximates that of an ultrarelativistic particle in arbitrary gravitational and electromagnetic fields. Finally, the paradigmatic example of a sinusoidal electro-magnetic wave in the presence of a constant-amplitude gravitational wave is worked out explicitly and it shows how the presence of the gravitational wave can qualitatively change electromagnetic radiation-reaction effects.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapidly-rotating black-hole spacetimes outside general relativity are key to many tests of Einstein's theory. We here develop an efficient spectral method to represent such spacetimes analytically, in closed-form, and to high accuracy, in a large class of effective-field-theory extensions of general relativity. We exemplify this method by constructing, for the first time, closed-form and analytic representations of spinning black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet, dynamical Chern-Simons, and axidilaton gravity to an accuracy better than $10^{-8}$ for all dimensionless spins below 0.99.

 - **Abstract**
 The ringdown phase of the binary black hole (BBH) merger provides a clean and direct probe of strong-field gravity and tests of the nature of black holes. The quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies in modified gravity theories, as well as their amplitudes and phases, might deviate from the Kerr ones in general relativity. Charged black holes (BHs) in Einstein-Maxwell theory provide an excellent example of a beyond-Kerr solution with direct astrophysical and fundamental physics applications. In this work, we extract the ringdown mode amplitudes and phases for charged BBH mergers based on fully general relativistic simulations with charge-to-mass ratio up to 0.3. Our results suggest that even though the inspiral phase of charged BBHs can be significantly accelerated or decelerated, the ringdown mode excitation only changes mildly. We further explore the charge detectability with the ringdown-only signal for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer. We find that previous studies may have overestimated the charge detectability and including higher modes in charged waveforms is necessary for future ringdown analysis. This constitutes the first such analysis based on waveforms generated by numerical relativity simulations of charged BHs in full Einstein-Maxwell theory.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive analysis of the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a massive scalar field in Schwarzschild spacetime using two complementary numerical techniques: the Hill-determinant method and Leaver continued-fraction method. Our study systematically compares the performance, convergence, and consistency of the two approaches across a wide range of field masses and angular momenta. We identify three critical mass thresholds, $m_{\rm lim}$, $m_{\rm max}$, and $m_{zd}$, which govern qualitative changes in the QNM spectrum. In particular, long-lived modes emerge at $m_{zd}$, where the imaginary part of the frequency vanishes and the mode becomes essentially non-decaying. This phenomenon is robust across multipoles and may have important implications for the phenomenology of massive fields around black holes. Our results provide a detailed numerical characterization of massive scalar QNMs and highlight the complementary strengths of the Hill-determinant and continued-fraction methods, paving the way for future studies of rotating or charged black holes and quasi-bound states.

 - **Abstract**
 When numerically solving Einstein's equations for binary black holes (BBH), we must find initial data on a three-dimensional spatial slice by solving constraint equations. The construction of initial data is a multi-step process, in which one first chooses freely specifiable data that define a conformal background and impose boundary conditions. Then, one numerically solves elliptic equations and calculates physical properties such as horizon masses, spins, and asymptotic quantities from the solution. To achieve desired properties, one adjusts the free data in an iterative ``control'' loop. Previous methods for these iterative adjustments rely on Newtonian approximations and do not allow the direct control of total energy and angular momentum of the system, which becomes particularly important in the study of hyperbolic encounters of black holes. Using the $\texttt{SpECTRE}$ code, we present a novel parameter control procedure that benefits from Broyden's method in all controlled quantities. We use this control scheme to minimize drifts in bound orbits and to enable the construction of hyperbolic encounters. We see that the activation of off-diagonal terms in the control Jacobian gives us better efficiency when compared to the simpler implementation in the Spectral Einstein Code ($\texttt{SpEC}$). We demonstrate robustness of the method across extreme configurations, including spin magnitudes up to $\chi = 0.9999$, mass ratios up to $q = 50$, and initial separations up to $D_0 = 1000M$. Given the open-source nature of $\texttt{SpECTRE}$, this is the first time a parameter control scheme for constructing bound and unbound BBH initial data is available to the numerical-relativity community.

#### The bound orbits and gravitational waveforms of timelike particles around renormalization group improved Kerr black holes

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we investigate the bound orbits of the timelike particles and the gravitational waveforms emitted from these orbits around a renormalization group improved Kerr black hole in the framework of the asymptotic safety approach. The running Newton coupling in the metric is characterized by two free quantum parameters $(\omega,\,\gamma)$ arsing from the non-perturbative renormalization group theory and the appropriate cutoff identification, respectively. As expected, the radii of the horizon, the marginally bound orbits and the innermost stable orbit are all decrease as the quantum parameters increase. Under the extreme mass-ratio inspirals approximation the deviation of gravitational waveforms radiated by the periodic orbits from those in the classical Kerr background increases with the two quantum parameter. However, this effect is much smaller in the retrograde case compared to the prograde case. Especially, by comparing the characteristic strain of those gravitational wave with the sensitivity curve of several potential detectors, we find that their characteristic frequencies can fall within the sensitivity ranges of several planned gravitational wave observatories, suggesting that such signals may be detectable with sufficient instrumental sensitivity.

 - **Abstract**
 GW230814 was detected by the LIGO Livingston observatory with a signal-to-noise ratio of 42.4 making it the loudest gravitational-wave signal in the GWTC-4.0 catalog. The source is consistent with a binary black hole coalescence similar to those in the previously observed population, with component masses $m_1 = 33.7^{+2.9}_{-2.2}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$, $m_2 = 28.2^{+2.2}_{-3.1} M_\odot$, and small effective inspiral spin $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}= -0.01^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$. The high signal-to-noise ratio enabled us to confidently detect an $\ell = |m| = 4$ mode in the inspiral signal for the first time, and enables a range of tests of consistency between theoretical predictions and the observed waveform. Most of these tests show good agreement with expectations from general relativity. However, a few indicate deviations, particularly in the ringdown part of the signal. We find that deviations comparable to those observed can be obtained from similar simulated signals based on general relativity and detector noise effects. Therefore, the apparent deviations do not provide evidence for a violation of general relativity. The observation of GW230814 demonstrates that while the unprecedented sensitivity of the detectors enable highly significant detections with a single observatory, drawing robust inferences about fundamental physics remains limited without data from a multiple observatory network.

#### Directed searches for gravitational waves from ultralight vector boson clouds around merger remnant and galactic black holes during the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first directed searches for long-transient and continuous gravitational waves from ultralight vector boson clouds around known black holes (BHs). We use LIGO data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run. The searches target two distinct types of BHs and use two new semicoherent methods: hidden Markov model (HMM) tracking for the remnant BHs of the mergers GW230814_230901 and GW231123_135430 (referred to as GW230814 and GW231123 in this study), and a dedicated method using the Band Sampled Data (BSD) framework for the galactic BH in the Cygnus X-1 binary system. Without finding evidence of a signal from vector bosons in the data, we estimate the mass range that can be constrained. For the HMM searches targeting the remnants from GW231123 and GW230814, we disfavor vector boson masses in the ranges $[0.94, 1.08]$ and $[2.75, 3.28] \times 10^{-13}$ eV, respectively, at 30% confidence, assuming a 1% false alarm probability. Although these searches are only marginally sensitive to signals from merger remnants at relatively large distances, future observations are expected to yield more stringent constraints with high confidence. For the BSD search targeting the BH in Cygnus X-1, we exclude vector boson masses in the range $[0.85, 1.59] \times 10^{-13}$ eV at 95% confidence, assuming an initial BH spin larger than 0.5.

 - **Abstract**
 The Carrollian limit ($c \to 0$) of General Relativity provides the geometric language for describing null hypersurfaces, such as black hole event horizons and null infinity. Motivated by the well-established electric and magnetic limits of Galilean electromagnetism, we perform a systematic analysis of the low-velocity limit of linearized gravity to derive its Carrollian counterparts. Using a 1+3 covariant decomposition, we study the transformation properties of linear tensor perturbations (gravitational waves) on a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker background under Carrollian boosts. We demonstrate that, analogous to the electromagnetic case, the full set of linearized Einstein's equations is not Carrollian-invariant. Instead, the theory bifurcates into two distinct and consistent frameworks: a Carrollian Electric Limit and a Carrollian Magnetic Limit. In the electric limit, dynamics are frozen, leaving a static theory of tidal forces ($E_{ab}$) constrained by the matter distribution. In contrast, the Magnetic Limit yields a consistent dynamical theory where the magnetic part of the Weyl tensor ($H_{ab}$), which governs gravito-magnetic and radiative effects, remains well-defined and is sourced by the spacetime shear. This framework resolves ambiguities in defining Carrollian gravity and provides a robust theory for gravito-magnetic dynamics in ultra-relativistic regimes. Our results have direct implications for the study of black hole horizons, gravitational memory, and the holographic principle.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we treat black holes as bifurcation points and explore their thermodynamic phase structure using the framework of bifurcation theory which is a commonly used method from nonlinear dynamics. By constructing an appropriate bifurcating function, we analyze how black holes transition between different thermodynamic phases through changes in the number and stability of fixed points. Our study shows that stable fixed points correspond to thermodynamically stable black hole states, while unstable ones indicate instability and decay. The dynamical evolution of the system further supports this correspondence, with stable configurations approaching equilibrium and unstable ones diverging from it.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the motion of spinning particles around a covariant quantum-corrected black hole without a Cauchy horizon within the framework of effective quantum gravity, and examine the influence of quantum gravitational effects on the motion of these spinning particles. First, we employ the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations to derive the 4-momentum and 4-velocity of spinning particles, and introduce the effective potential for radial motion using the components of the 4-momentum. We find that an increase in the quantum parameter $\zeta$ leads to a decrease in the effective potential, while the spin $S$ significantly affects the magnitude of the effective potential. Then, through the effective potential, we investigate the properties of circular orbits and the innermost stable circular orbit, and discuss the timelike condition that spinning particles must satisfy when moving around the black hole. Finally, we study the trajectories of spinning particles on bound orbits around the quantum-corrected black hole and compare them with those around other covariant quantum-corrected black holes. The results show that the trajectories of spinning particles in this quantum-corrected black hole model are weakly influenced by $\zeta$, making them almost indistinguishable from those in the Schwarzschild black hole, but they can be distinguished from other covariant quantum-corrected models under certain initial conditions. These results contribute to our understanding of black hole properties under quantum corrections.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we theoretically investigate the deflection of light, lensing equations, topological properties of photon rings, and accretion disk characteristics in the spacetime of a holonomy-corrected Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings. The analysis is carried out in the weak-field limit, where we analytically derive expressions for the deflection angle and extract the corresponding lensing observables. These results reveal the dependence of light deflection on the string cloud parameter and the holonomy correction parameter, offering potential observational signatures of underlying quantum gravity effects. We model possible gravitational scenarios to explore the distinguishing features of this modified BH geometry and assess its deviation from classical solutions through gravitational lensing behavior. Furthermore, we analyze the topological structure of the photon sphere by constructing a normalized vector field and demonstrate how it is affected by the presence of string clouds and holonomy corrections. Finally, we examine the properties of a thin accretion disk in this BH background, showing that both the string cloud and holonomy parameters significantly influence the disk's radiation profile, temperature distribution, and spectral characteristics. Our results suggest that these modifications leave measurable imprints, providing viable avenues for observational constraints in the strong-gravity regime.

#### Is GW190521 a gravitational wave echo of wormhole remnant from another universe?

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.07831

 - **Abstract**
 A particularly compelling aspect of the GW190521 event detected by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration is that it has an extremely short duration, and lacks a clearly identifiable inspiral phase usually observed in the binary black holes (BBHs) coalescence. In this work, we hypothesize that GW190521 might represent a single, isolated gravitational wave (GW) echo pulse from the wormhole, which is the postmerger remnant of BBHs in another universe and connected to our universe through a throat. The ringdown signal after BBHs merged in another universe can pass through the throat of wormhole and be detected in our universe as a short-duration echo pulse. Our analysis results indicate that our model yields a network signal-to-noise ratio comparable to that of the standard BBHs merger model reported by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration. Though the Bayesian factor slightly prefers the standard BBHs merger model, it is not significant enough to rule out the possibility that the echo-for-wormhole model is a viable hypothesis for the GW190521 event.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the implications of the most recent DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) DR2 and DESyr5 compilation of supernovae (SNe) datasets for modified gravity focusing on non-metricity based $f(Q)$ theory, by employing a `model-independent' approach. We reconstruct of dark energy density which is then extended to estimate the perturbation-level quantities, sourced by the modified gravity, namely the effective gravitational coupling, $\mu$, and the amplitude damping parameter of gravitational wave propagation, $\nu$. In light of the remarkable hints for a dynamical dark energy emerging from the analysis of background cosmological data, we discuss the possibility to distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity scenarios from their scalar and tensor perturbation-level signatures. We contrast our findings between the older Pantheon+ and the newer DESyr5 compilations of SNe datasets, which predict a significant distinct signature in the damping parameter of the gravitational wave propagation amplitude. On the other hand, the prediction for the effective gravitational coupling remains insensitive to the choice of the SNe datasets. Our results provide a strong case for the study of gravitational wave propagation in modified gravity theories, in light of the new generation of gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work has revealed that extremal Kerr black holes may exhibit a sensitivity to higher-derivative corrections to Einstein's equations, displaying singularities in the tidal forces at the horizon. However, in a purely gravitational context, this "ultraviolet sensitivity" translates into a strong dependence on the Wilson coefficients in the low-energy effective field theory. These, in turn, are fixed by the underlying theory of quantum gravity in the ultraviolet. We find a prediction for these coefficients within the framework of asymptotically safe quantum gravity, and show that, if the quantum gravity scale is trans-Planckian, this horizon-scale ultraviolet sensitivity is avoided.

 - **Abstract**
 The Higgs boson is often compared to a small ripple on a vast, calm ocean. This "ocean" is the universal Higgs vacuum expectation value, about 246 GeV, permeating all space and generating particle masses. Its remarkable uniformity reflects the large-scale nature of the universe. Here I argue that the Higgs field plays a far deeper role. In regions of extreme gravity near singularities, it becomes a non-perturbative, space-time--dependent field that creates new space-time domains beyond gravitational singularities -- new regions governed by antigravity. This mechanism produces dramatic dynamics inside black holes and in the earliest universe, including restoration of the electroweak symmetry SU(2)xU(1) at singularities. The adjoining gravity and antigravity regions form a geodesically complete space-time bridged by traversable singularities -- absent in the Standard Model coupled to general relativity or its extensions such as string theory. In such a framework, the black hole information paradox admits a new, manifestly unitary resolution. Details of computations are developed in the companion paper [1]; here, only a brief outline is given.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the geometry of the gauged quiver quantum mechanics realizing $D(2,1;0)$ superconformal symmetry. These models arise as effective descriptions of multi-centered D-brane systems in type II Calabi-Yau compactifications, in the $AdS_2$ scaling limit, and they describe the near-horizon microscopics of multi-centered BPS black holes in the four dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity. We work in the gauged sigma model formulation with off-shell $(4,4,0)$ multiplets, which allows us to introduce a coordinate system adapted to the complex structure of the gauged sigma model target space, that assigns a radial-angular frame to each quiver node in the physical configuration space. It provides an explicit decomposition of the sigma model quiver metric into distinct sectors governed by couplings between each node. We compute the full target space metric for 2-node and 3-node quiver configurations, and generalize to symmetric $N$-node crystal quivers. Finally we implement Gaiotto-Simons-Strominger-Yin's $D(2,1;0)$ index for this system and show that the corresponding gauged superconformal index -- at least in a rich family of physical examples -- provides a new tool for resolving the conical singularity complications generically present in the ungauged superconformal mechanics.
