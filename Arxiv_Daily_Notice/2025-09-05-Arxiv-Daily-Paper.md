 - **Abstract**
 The orbits of stars around Sgr A*, the Milky Way's supermassive black hole, provide a unique laboratory for testing its environment with unprecedented precision. In this work, we compute the apsidal precession induced by extended matter distributions through Lagrange's equations and compare it with the measured precession of S2, reproducing and extending GRAVITY's constraints. In particular, we push bounds on boson clouds to larger gravitational couplings $\alpha$ and to the second-fastest superradiant mode. We also show that environments with mass of order $1\%$ of Sgr A* drive stellar orbits to decay by dynamical friction within a few Myr. The inner star cluster is however efficiently replenished, masking this effect observationally. We also show that orbital resonances from boson clouds have no impact on relevant timescales. While S2 currently provides the cleanest dataset, our framework is readily applicable to other stars that we identify as particularly promising, whose orbits will be measured with increasing accuracy, opening up new opportunities to probe the environment of Sgr A*.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent observations of highly accreting supermassive black holes (SMBH) at very high redshift ($>$4) with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allowed us to shed light for the very first time on the early evolutionary phases of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps unsurprisingly, several of the physical properties observed in these new objects, including those known as little red dots (LRDs), are closely reminiscent of the low-mass and high-Eddington AGN in the local Universe, and in particular of the class of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies. However, some differences also emerged, likely due to the radically different evolutionary path and the environment where LRDs and NLS1s live. In this work, we review the multiwavelength properties of local NLS1s and compare them with type 1 AGN found at high-$z$, showing that despite some differences, the study of NLS1s can be extremely useful to better understand the extreme accretion physics of high-$z$ quasars and the early stages of AGN evolution.

#### The Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere cosmic shear project V: Constraints on cosmology and astrophysics from 270 million galaxies across 13,000 deg$^2$ of the sky

 - **Abstract**
 We present constraints on models of cosmology and astrophysics using cosmic shear data vectors from three datasets: the northern and southern Galactic cap of the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) project, and the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3. These data vectors combined consist of 270 million galaxies spread across 13,000 ${\rm deg}^2$ of the sky. We first extract constraints for $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and find $S_8= 0.805^{+0.019}_{-0.019}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.262^{+0.023}_{-0.036}$, which is consistent within $1.9 \sigma$ of constraints from the Planck satellite. Extending our analysis to dynamical dark energy models shows that lensing provides some (but still minor) improvements to existing constraints from supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations. Finally, we study six different models for the impact of baryons on the matter power spectrum. We show the different models provide consistent constraints on baryon suppression, and associated cosmology, once the astrophysical priors are sufficiently wide. Current scale-cut approaches for mitigating baryon contamination result in a residual bias of $\approx 0.3\sigma$ in the $S_8, \Omega_{\rm m}$ posterior. Using all scales with dedicated baryon modeling leads to negligible improvement as the new information is used solely to self-calibrate the baryon model on small scales. Additional non-lensing datasets, and/or calibrations of the baryon model, will be required to access the full statistical power of the lensing measurements. The combined dataset in this work represents the largest lensing dataset to date (most galaxies, largest area) and provides an apt testing ground for analyses of upcoming datasets from Stage IV surveys. The DECADE shear catalogs, data vectors, and likelihoods are made publicly available.

#### Fueling, Evolution, and Diversity of AGN in Dwarf Galaxies: Insights from Star Formation and Black Hole Scaling Relations

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the star formation activity and black hole scaling relations in a sample of 1451 AGN hosted by dwarf galaxies at redshift 0.5 to 0.9, drawn from the VIPERS survey. The sample comprises Seyferts and LINERs identified through emission-line diagnostics, as well as IR-selected AGN based on WISE colors. Using the parameter SFRnorm, defined as the ratio of the SFR of a galaxy hosting an AGN to the median SFR of star-forming galaxies of similar stellar mass and redshift, we compare AGN hosts to a control sample of non-AGN star-forming galaxies. We examine how SFRnorm varies with AGN power ([O III] luminosity), black hole mass, local environment, and stellar population age. We also analyze the MBH-Mstar relation and the evolution of the MBH/Mstar ratio, incorporating comparisons to X-ray AGN and high-redshift quasars (z > 4). Our key findings are: (i) all AGN populations show suppressed star formation at low AGN luminosities, with SFRnorm rising above unity at different luminosity thresholds depending on AGN type; (ii) LINERs show flat SFRnorm trends with MBH, remaining broadly consistent with unity; Seyferts display a mild increase with MBH, while IR AGN show a more pronounced positive trend; (iii) LINERs exhibit older stellar populations than Seyferts; (iv) at fixed stellar mass, Seyferts host more massive black holes than LINERs, with IR AGN falling in between; (v) the MBH/Mstar ratio is elevated relative to local scaling relations and remains approximately constant with redshift, in agreement with high-z AGN; (vi) the ratio decreases with stellar mass up to log(Mstar/Msun) approximately 11, beyond which it flattens toward values consistent with those of local, inactive galaxies, with this trend clearest for Seyferts and IR AGN. These results suggest that AGN in dwarf galaxies follow diverse evolutionary pathways shaped by gas availability, feedback, and selection effects.

#### Unraveling the Nature of the Nuclear Transient AT2020adpi

 - **Abstract**
 Transient events associated with supermassive black holes provide rare opportunities to study accretion and the environments of supermassive black holes. We present a multiwavelength study of AT2020adpi (ZTF20acvfraq), a luminous optical/UV transient in the nucleus of the galaxy WISEA J231853.77$-$103505.6 ($z=0.26$) that exhibits the properties of an ambiguous nuclear transient. Near peak, its spectral energy distribution is well described by a power law ($\lambda L_\lambda \propto \lambda^{-\alpha}$, $\alpha = 0.44 \pm 0.04$), with a maximum $g$-band luminosity of $(3.6 \pm 0.6)\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is consistent with luminous AGN flares. We detect a strong mid-infrared flare ($L_\mathrm{peak}^{\mathrm{MIR}} = (2.3 \pm 0.05)\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) delayed by $\sim$240 rest-frame days, indicating a hot dust echo from material at $\sim$0.2 pc. The optical and near-infrared spectra show broad H, He I, [OIII] lines, as well as narrow Fe II, and prominent Mg II, which is a combination not typical of TDEs. Taken together, these features suggest AT2020adpi is an ambiguous nuclear transient, where an accretion episode was triggered by stellar disruption of an accretion disk or instabilities within an active nucleus. This source demonstrates the need for careful multiwavelength analysis to distinguish between extreme AGN variability and TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave standard sirens offer a promising avenue for cosmological inference, particularly in measuring the expansion history of the universe. Traditionally, bright sirens require an electromagnetic counterpart to determine the redshift of the emission source while dark sirens rely on the presence of complete galaxy catalogs over large sky regions. Spectral sirens, using GW data alone, can circumvent these limitations by leveraging features in the mass distribution of compact binaries. With the recent release of the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 4 (GWTC-4.0), the number of significant binary black hole (BBH) merger candidates has increased to 153, enabling more robust population studies and cosmological constraints. This work builds upon previous spectral siren analyses by analyzing the latest BBH observations with parametric and non-parametric models. In particular, we consider a parametric approach using the Powerlaw + Peak and Broken Powerlaw + 2 Peaks models as well as a more flexible non-parametric model based on Gaussian processes. We find broad consistency in the inferred Hubble constant $H_0$ constraints across models. Our most constraining result is from the Gaussian Process model, which, combined with the GW170817 bright siren measurement, results in $H_0 = 69^{+7}_{-6} \ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, a 10% precision measurement. For the Powerlaw + Peak and Broken Powerlaw + 2 Peaks we find fractional uncertainties of 17% and 13% respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Some black holes in X-ray binaries accrete at rates far above the Eddington limit. In this supercritical regime, photons are trapped in a radiation-dominated, geometrically thick disk. The innermost regions form a complex environment of intense radiation, strong magnetic fields, and powerful outflows, where radiation-driven winds expel large amounts of mass. These conditions suppress primary relativistic electrons within the transparent funnel along the black hole's spin axis. We show that high-energy electrons can instead arise as secondary pairs from Bethe-Heitler interactions between relativistic protons and ambient photons. Using self-similar models of accretion disks with strong winds of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), we compute particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection and diffusive shocks, evaluate energy losses, and assess the efficiency and spectral imprint of Bethe-Heitler pair production. Our results suggest that secondary pairs can yield nonthermal radiation in the 0.1-100 MeV range with luminosities from $10^{34}$ up to $10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This emission could be detectable by future MeV instruments from Galactic ULXs, offering evidence of relativistic protons in their inner funnels and revealing misaligned, otherwise hidden, super-Eddington sources in the Milky Way.

#### PANDORA: New avenues in sub-percent photometric precision for ground based astronomy

 - **Abstract**
 Precision photometric calibration is key to a number of astrophysical research areas such as supernova cosmology and dark energy studies. In the age of large surveys, pushing the limits of photometry is a worthy challenge, with traditional celestial calibrators limited to approximately percent precision. Here we present PANDORA, a novel calibration source that achieves sub-percent photometric precision across the optical spectrum with a selectable dynamic range and high optical efficiency. Building on proven collimated beam projector designs for relative throughput calibration of survey telescopes, PANDORA is capable of delivering photons anywhere in the 350-1100 nm spectral range. It uses selectable neutral density filters and sequential NIST-calibrated photodiode feedback to internally self-calibrate prior to operation, and is illuminated by an Energetiq EQ-99X-FC broadband laser-driven light source. We present here an overview of the system design, operation, and laboratory characterization results. PANDORA will begin science operations this year to support the upcoming LS4 survey on the ESO 1m Schmidt telescope.

#### Confirming lensed-quasar candidates with DESI and P200 spectroscopy I. 14 lensed quasars and 8 lensed galaxy

 - **Abstract**
 Lensed quasars are powerful probes of cosmology, the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, and the distribution of dark matter. We cross-match 1,724 previously identified candidates from HSC, KiDS, and the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS) with DESI DR1, obtaining 937 DESI spectra for 677 unique systems. Combining DESI spectroscopy with observations from the Palomar 200-inch Double Spectrograph (P200/DBSP), we confirm three lensed quasars with source redshifts of 1.71, 1.93, and 3.23 and Einstein radii of 0.96, 0.39, and 1.07 arcsec, respectively. We further identify 11 high-confidence candidates that are well reproduced by a simple singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model, exhibit lens galaxies in the image modeling, and have at least one available spectrum; across these, the Einstein radius spans 0.39 to 2.34 arcsec and the source redshift spans 1.13 to 2.88. In 8 of the 11 cases, the systems already satisfy our lensing criteria except that only one quasar image currently has a spectrum; obtaining a second spectrum for the other image would enable immediate confirmation. As by-products, we report eight new lensed galaxies spanning galaxy- to group-scale lenses. These results provide valuable targets for follow-up studies and underscore the efficiency of wide-field spectroscopic surveys such as DESI in confirming gravitationally lensed quasars and galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of primordial black holes (PBHs) would mark a major breakthrough, with far-reaching implications for early universe cosmology, fundamental physics, and the nature of dark matter. Gravitational wave observations have recently emerged as a powerful tool to test the existence and properties of PBHs, as these objects leave distinctive imprints on the gravitational waveform. Notably, there are no known astrophysical processes that can form sub-solar mass black holes, making their discovery a compelling signal of new physics. In addition to PBHs, we consider other exotic compact object (ECO) candidates-such as strange quark stars and boson stars-which can produce similar gravitational signatures and potentially mimic PBHs. In this work, we employ the Fisher matrix formalism to explore a broad parameter space, including binary masses, spins, and a variety of nuclear and quark matter equations of state. Our goal is to assess the ability of next-generation gravitational wave detectors-specifically Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope-to distinguish PBHs from ECOs, stellar BHs and neutron stars. We compute the maximum luminosity distances at which confident ($\geq 3\sigma$) detections of sub-solar masses or tidal effects are possible, providing quantitative benchmarks for PBH identification or exclusion under various observational scenarios. Our results indicate that next-generation detectors will be capable of probing sub-solar mass PBHs out to cosmological distances of $z \sim 3$. For heavier objects with masses up to $M \lesssim 2 M_\odot$, we show that PBHs can be distinguished from neutron stars via their lack of tidal effects up to redshifts of $z \sim 0.2$.

#### ZTF SNe Ia DR2: Towards cosmology-grade ZTF supernova light curves using scene modeling photometry

 - **Abstract**
 The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is conducting a wide-field survey of the northern sky in three optical bands and the collaboration cosmology working group has released 3628 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered during its first 2.5 years of operation. This "ZTF SN Ia DR2" sample is the largest SN Ia dataset to date. Fully exploiting this dataset to improve understanding of the properties of dark energy requires a photometric accuracy of O(0.1%). This can be achieved using Scene Modeling Photometry (SMP), which is optimal to extract a transient signal (SN) from a complex background (its host), while ensuring a common flux estimator with nearby stars used as calibration reference. In this paper, we present the status of the SMP development and use it to assess the precision and accuracy of the ZTF SN Ia DR2 force photometry light curves. We reach a repeatability of the star observations better than 1%. However, we have identified a new sensor effect, dubbed "pocket-effect", which distorts the Point Spread Function (PSF) in a flux-dependent manner leading to non-linearities in the photometry of a few percent. Correcting for this effect requires time- and sensor-dependent corrections to be applied at the pixel level, which is currently under development. This effects affects all light curve releases to date -- both from forced photometry and scene modelling preventing ZTF SN Ia DR2 to be used for accurate cosmological inference. Comparing the SMP and forced photometry measurements, we find that stretch and color estimated from both processings are consistent, aside from a 10 mmag shift in color. This assess the robustness of results presented as part of the the ZTF SN Ia DR2 release. The absolute calibration however shifts by 90 mmag. A reprocessing of the full ZTF SN Ia DR2 dataset using the SMP method is currently in progress.

#### Reduced Gas Accretion onto Galaxies due to Effects of External Giant Radio Lobes

 - **Abstract**
 Suppression effects of giant radio lobes from supermassive black holes on gas accretion onto galaxies in the surrounding regions are quantified using cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. With an appropriate amount of radio jet energy injected into the intergalactic medium following the formation peak of supermassive black holes at redshift two, we find that galaxies in the greater neighborhood of the jet-launching massive galaxies subsequently experience a significant reduction in the amount of accreted gas. The distribution of the resulting magnetic field in the intergalactic medium is highly inhomogeneous, due to the highly biased nature of the most massive supermassive black holes. In regions with magnetic field strength $B>10^{-2}\mu$G, the baryon fraction is on average reduced by 17%, 14%, and 12%, respectively, for halos of mass in the range of $[10^{11}-10^{12})\msun$, $[10^{12}-10^{13})\msun$, and $[10^{13}-10^{14})\msun$. A proper inclusion of this new, external, global, preventive feedback mechanism from AGN in the next generation of cosmological simulation may be necessary.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar theory predicts a forbidden range of black-hole masses between ${\sim}50$--$130\,M_\odot$ due to pair-instability supernovae, but evidence for such a gap in the mass distribution from gravitational-wave astronomy has proved elusive. Early hints of a cutoff in black-hole masses at ${\sim} 45\,M_\odot$ disappeared with the subsequent discovery of more massive binary black holes. Here, we report evidence of the pair-instability gap in LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA's fourth gravitational wave transient catalog (GWTC-4), with a lower boundary of $45_{-4}^{+5} M_\odot$ (90\% credibility). While the gap is not present in the distribution of \textit{primary} masses $m_1$ (the bigger of the two black holes in a binary system), it appears unambiguously in the distribution of \textit{secondary} masses $m_2$, where $m_2 \leq m_1$. The location of the gap lines up well with a previously identified transition in the binary black-hole spin distribution; binaries with primary components in the gap tend to spin more rapidly than those below the gap. We interpret these findings as evidence for a subpopulation of hierarchical mergers: binaries where the primary component is the product of a previous black-hole merger and thus populates the gap. Our measurement of the location of the pair-instability gap constrains the $S$-factor for $^{12}\rm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\rm{O}$ at 300keV to $256_{-104}^{+197}$ keV barns.

#### Bright siren without electromagnetic counterpart by LISA-Taiji-TianQin network

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) with electromagnetic counterparts (EMc) offer a novel approach to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$), known as bright sirens, enabling $H_0$ measurements by combining GW-derived distances with EM-derived redshifts. Host galaxy identification is essential for redshift determination but remains challenging due to poor GW sky localization and uncertainties in EMc models. To overcome these limitations, we exploit the ultra-high-precision localization ($\Delta \Omega_s \sim 10^{-4} \, \text{deg}^2$) with a space-based GW detector network (LISA-Taiji-TianQin), which permits unique host identification solely from GW signals. We integrate five massive black hole binary (MBHB) population models and two galaxy number density models to compute the redshift horizon for host galaxy identification and evaluate $H_0$ constraints. We find that (1) The network enhances localization by several orders of magnitude compared to single detectors; (2) The identification horizon reaches $z\sim 1.2$ for specific MBHBs in the most accurate localization case; (3) The population model choice critically impacts the outcomes: the most refined population models yield to independent EMc identification rate of 0.6-1 $\text{yr}^{-1}$ with $H_0$ constraints $< 1\%$ fractional uncertainty, the less refined models lead to the rate $<0.1\text{yr}^{-1}$ and $1-2\%$ uncertainty on $H_0$.

#### GWTC-4.0: Constraints on the Cosmic Expansion Rate and Modified Gravitational-wave Propagation

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze data from 142 of the 218 gravitational-wave (GW) sources in the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4.0) to estimate the Hubble constant $H_0$ jointly with the population properties of merging compact binaries. We measure the luminosity distance and redshifted masses of GW sources directly; in contrast, we infer GW source redshifts statistically through i) location of features in the compact object mass spectrum and merger rate evolution, and ii) identifying potential host galaxies in the GW localization volume. Probing the relationship between source luminosity distances and redshifts obtained in this way yields constraints on cosmological parameters. We also constrain parameterized deviations from general relativity which affect GW propagation, specifically those modifying the dependence of a GW signal on the source luminosity distance. Assuming our fiducial model for the source-frame mass distribution and using GW candidates detected up to the end of the fourth observing run (O4a), together with the GLADE+ all-sky galaxy catalog, we estimate $H_0 = 76.6^{+13.0}_{-9.5} (76.6^{+25.2}_{-14.0})$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. This value is reported as a median with 68.3% (90%) symmetric credible interval, and includes combination with the $H_0$ measurement from GW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart. Using a parametrization of modified GW propagation in terms of the magnitude parameter $\Xi_0$, we estimate $\Xi_0 = 1.2^{+0.8}_{-0.4} (1.2^{+2.4}_{-0.5})$, where $\Xi_0 = 1$ recovers the behavior of general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 The one-dimensional flux power spectrum (P1D) of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest probes small-scale structure in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and is therefore sensitive to a variety of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. These include the amplitude and shape of the matter power spectrum, the thermal history of the IGM, the sum of neutrino masses, and potential small-scale fluctuations due to the nature of dark matter. However, P1D is also highly sensitive to observational and instrumental systematics, making accurate synthetic spectra essential for validating analyses and quantifying these effects, especially in high-volume surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We present an efficient lognormal mock framework for generating one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ forest spectra tailored for P1D analysis. Our method captures the redshift evolution of the mean transmitted flux and the scale-dependent shape and amplitude of the one-dimensional flux power spectrum by tuning Gaussian field correlations and transformation parameters. Across the DESI Early Data Release (EDR) redshift range ($2.0 \leq z \leq 3.8$), and a wide range of scales ($10^{-4}$ s km$^{-1} \leq k \leq 1.0$ s km$^{-1}$), our mocks recover the mean flux evolution with redshift to sub-percent accuracy, and the P1D at the percent level. Additionally, we discuss potential extensions of this framework, such as the incorporation of astrophysical contaminants, continuum uncertainties, and instrumental effects. Such improvements would expand its utility in ongoing and upcoming surveys and enable a broader range of validation efforts and systematics studies for P1D inference and precision cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy clusters, the Universe's largest halo structures, are filled with 10-100 million degree X-ray-emitting gas. Their evolution is shaped by energetic processes such as feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and mergers with other cosmic structures. The imprints of these processes on gas kinematic properties remain largely unknown, restricting our understanding of gas thermodynamics and energy conversion within clusters. High-resolution spectral mapping across a broad spatial-scale range provides a promising solution to this challenge, enabled by the recent launch of the XRISM X-ray Observatory. Here, we present the kinematic measurements of the X-ray-brightest Perseus cluster with XRISM, radially covering the extent of its cool core. We find direct evidence for the presence of at least two dominant drivers of gas motions operating on distinct physical scales: a small-scale driver in the inner ~60 kpc, likely associated with the SMBH feedback; and a large-scale driver in the outer core, powered by mergers. The inner driver sustains a heating rate at least an order of magnitude higher than the outer one. This finding suggests that, during the active phase, the SMBH feedback generates turbulence, which, if fully dissipated into heat, could play a significant role in offsetting radiative cooling losses in the Perseus core. Our study underscores the necessity of kinematic mapping observations of extended sources for robust conclusions on the properties of the velocity field and their role in the assembly and evolution of massive halos. It further offers a kinematic diagnostic for theoretical models of SMBH feedback.

 - **Abstract**
 Hawking radiation elucidates black holes as quantum thermodynamic systems, thereby establishing a conceptual bridge between general relativity and quantum mechanics through particle emission phenomena. While conventional theoretical frameworks predominantly focus on classical spacetime configurations, recent advancements in Extended Phase Space thermodynamics have redefined cosmological parameters (such as the $\Lambda$-term) as dynamic variables. Notably, the thermodynamics of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes has been successfully extended to incorporate thermodynamic pressure $P$. Within this extended phase space framework, although numerous intriguing physical phenomena have been identified, the tunneling mechanism of particles incorporating pressure and volume remains unexplored. This study investigates Hawking radiation through particle tunneling in Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter black holes within the extended phase space, where the thermodynamic pressure $P$ is introduced via a dynamic cosmological constant $\Lambda$. By employing semi-classical tunneling calculations with self-gravitation corrections, we demonstrate that emission probabilities exhibit a direct correlation with variations in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Significantly, the radiation spectrum deviates from pure thermality, aligning with unitary quantum evolution while maintaining consistency with standard phase space results. Moreover, through thermodynamic analysis, we have verified that the emission rate of particles is related to the difference in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the emitted particles before and after they tunnel through the potential barrier. These findings establish particle tunneling as a unified probe of quantum gravitational effects in black hole thermodynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 This manuscript explores the gravastar model in the $f(R,\Sigma,T)$ gravity framework, with the help of Kuchowicz metric funcition, offering an alternative to black holes. A gravastar has three regions: interior, intermediate shell, and exterior. The interior region has pressure equal to negative density, generating a repulsive force across the thin shell. The intermediate shell contains ultra-relativistic plasma fluids, with pressure proportional to density, balancing the interior's repulsive force. The exterior region is a vacuum, described by a generalized Schwarzschild solution. Our specifications yield precise, singularity-free gravaster solutions with physically valid features in the $f(R,\Sigma,T)$ gravity framework, exploring strong gravity and anti-gravity aspects. The gravitational Lagrangian is based on an arbitrary function of torsion scalar $\Sigma$ and trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. Our $f(R,\Sigma,T)$ gravity analysis explores gravastars inner workings, revealing insights into gravity, strong gravity, and antigravity forces due to torsion effects. We examine shell properties like length, energy, entropy, and discussed junction conditions. Key findings include constant interior density and pressure, denser shell fluid at the outer boundary, and increasing shell length. These results illuminate gravastar behavior and fundamental gravitational principles.

 - **Abstract**
 It is well-known that exotic compact objects (ECOs) are a class of objects categorised as Black Hole (BH) mimickers. ECOs have been shown to possess signatures distinguishing them from BHs. However, in our universe, no object exists in complete isolation. Consequently, any compact object, whether a BH or an ECO, must reside within some environment that inevitably influences the surrounding spacetime geometry due to back-reaction. In this paper, we investigate a scenario where an ECO is embedded in an environment of dark matter (DM). In this work, we assume two different models of the DM halo profile. We compute the Love numbers and GW echoes of this composite system to assess the impact of the surrounding dark matter halo. To analyze the echoes, we focus on odd-parity perturbations, while for calculating the tidal Love numbers, we consider both even and odd parity perturbations. We aim to understand how the DM properties couple to the ECO signatures in the Love number or the GW-echo signal, both of which have a strong bearing as observables in future-generation detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 Classical critical collapse yields naked singularities from smooth initial data, challenging cosmic censorship and shaping the spectrum of primordial black holes. We show that one-loop vacuum polarization near the threshold alters this outcome. In analytically tractable Einstein-scalar critical spacetimes, regularity uniquely selects a Boulware-like state whose stress tensor supplies a universal quantum growing mode. Its backreaction competes with the classical unstable mode, producing a shift of the critical point and a finite mass gap at the new threshold, thereby enforcing horizon formation even under arbitrary fine-tuning. In primordial collapse, the threshold shift enters exponentially into the formation fraction, while the gap truncates the low-mass tail -- effects that may reshape the predicted mass spectrum. These results provide the first consistent quantum treatment of critical collapse, offering definitive predictions for several long-standing problems.

 - **Abstract**
 We study second order gravitational perturbations on plane wave spacetimes from both the metric and curvature perturbation points of view. For the former, we explicitly use the isometries of the background to introduce tensor oscillator harmonics, which render Einstein's equations algebraic around symmetric plane waves. For the latter, we formulate the first and second order Teukolsky equations in a Geroch-Held-Penrose covariant way. Both approaches are useful in their own right, and together with our discussion on gauge freedom, they provide a foundation for the study of higher-order gravitational dynamics around plane wave spacetimes. Taking the perspective that these plane wave spacetimes arise from Penrose limits, we subsequently use these results to explore the nonlinear gravitational dynamics close to black hole lightrings. Specifically, we define and discuss quadratic quasinormal mode ratios, observe that they satisfy emergent selection rules, and make publicly available a code to compute them.

#### Correction to Hawking radiation in non-singular gravitational collapse

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have shown that quantum gravity introduces important corrections to the process of spherically symmetric gravitational collapse expected from general relativity. In particular, instead of falling into a central singularity, the collapsing body undergoes a bounce and eventually exits its Schwarzschild radius, and this entire process of collapse and rebound can occur in a single asymptotic region. In this paper, particle creation during such non-singular gravitational collapse is studied. It is shown that the probability of spontaneous emission of particles differs from the well-known probability of Hawking radiation from classical gravitational collapse. It is argued that the different result implies a deviation from thermality. Some arguments are also adduced concerning how the Hawking process during non-singular dust collapse could potentially remove shell crossing singularities.

#### Shadow and Quasi-Normal Modes of Schwarzschild-Hernquist Black Hole

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we study the shadow and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a black hole (BH) surrounded by a dark matter halo with Hernquist-type density distribution, which was reported in Ref. \cite{Cardoso:2021wlq}. In astrophysical scenarios, we find that the shadow radius enlarges as the compactness of halo increases. Therefore, we obtain an upper bound for the compactness ${\cal C}\le0.092$ with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations. We calculate axial gravitational QNMs of the galactic BH up to ${\cal C}\sim{\cal O}(1)$, and fit the redshift relative to Schwarzschild QNMs up to second order in the compactness (for ${\cal C}\le0.3)$. These highly redshifted QNMs, resulting from large compactness, are key to modeling the dark matter halo.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04049

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate wormhole solutions within the framework of the semi-classical Einstein equations in the presence of the conformal anomaly (or trace anomaly). These solutions are sourced by a stress-energy tensor (SET) derived from the trace anomaly, and depend on two positive coefficients, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, determined by the matter content of the theory and on the degrees of freedom of the involved quantum fields. For a Type B anomaly ($\alpha=0$), we obtain wormhole geometries assuming a constant redshift function and show that the SET components increase with the parameter $\lambda$. In the case of a Type A anomaly ($\lambda=0$), we generalize previously known solutions, yielding a family of geometries that includes Lorentzian wormholes, naked singularities, and the Schwarzschild black hole. Using isotropic coordinates, we identify parameter choices that produce traversable wormhole solutions. Extending to the full trace-anomaly contribution, we solve the differential equation near the throat to obtain the redshift function and demonstrate that both the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars remain finite at the throat. We further analyze the trajectories of null and timelike particles, showing that the height and width of the effective potential for null geodesics increase monotonically with $\alpha$, while the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius also grows with larger $\alpha$. These results illustrate the rich interplay between trace anomaly effects and the structure and dynamics of wormhole spacetimes.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the existence and nature of the photon spheres (PS) in the background of four dimensional static and spherically symmetric black holes in the de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity theory. Apart from the known case of one PS, there are regions in the parameter space of massive gravity where either two or no PS's exist outside the event horizon. Topological arguments show that, the case of one PS falls in the category of Einstein gravity (with topological charge $-1$), whereas, the cases with two or zero PS's belong to a different topological class with total charge zero. PS's of horizonless compact objects, also belong to the same class with total topological charge $0$, though, one distinction can be made with the black holes in massive gravity. While in the former case, the inner PS is stable, in the later case, it is the outer PS which is stable (the inner PS is unstable). We also study the landscape of possible regions of existence of standard and exotic photon spheres in the massive gravity parameter space, and correlate it with the horizon structure of the black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a GPU-accelerated implementation of the gravitational-wave Bayesian inference pipeline for parameter estimation and model comparison. Specifically, we implement the `acceptance-walk' sampling method, a cornerstone algorithm for gravitational-wave inference within the bilby and dynesty framework. By integrating this trusted kernel with the vectorized blackjax-ns framework, we achieve typical speedups of 20-40x for aligned spin binary black hole analyses, while recovering posteriors and evidences that are statistically identical to the original CPU implementation. This faithful re-implementation of a community-standard algorithm establishes a foundational benchmark for gravitational-wave inference. It quantifies the performance gains attributable solely to the architectural shift to GPUs, creating a vital reference against which future parallel sampling algorithms can be rigorously assessed. This allows for a clear distinction between algorithmic innovation and the inherent speedup from hardware. Our work provides a validated community tool for performing GPU-accelerated nested sampling in gravitational-wave data analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 We developed a numerical code which evolves the semiclassical Einstein's equation (with the quantum stress-energy contribution added as a source term) for the spherically symmetric metric inside an evaporating semiclassical charged black hole. An analytical approximation for the evolving semiclassical metric was recently developed by Ori and Zilberman (and will be briefly overviewed here). We seek to numerically check the validity of this analytical approximation. The Einstein equations in this case are partial differential equations for the two unknown metric functions which fully describe the spherically symmetric metric. We begin our numerical simulation close to the event horizon with regular initial data specified by a variant of the charged Vaidya metric. We then evolve the metric functions deep into the neighborhood of the inner horizon. We explore the results of running this numerical code in several representative cases. Our numerical simulations confirm the validity of the above mentioned analytical approximation in all these cases.

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is a pivotal problem in modern cosmology. This work explores the potential of the Taiji-TianQin space-borne gravitational-wave (GW) detector network to identify the formation channels of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) at high redshifts ($z \gtrsim 10$). The network substantially improves detection capability, boosting the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 2.2-3.0 (1.06-1.14) relative to TianQin (Taiji) alone. It increases the detection rate of MBHBs formed from light seeds (LS) by more than 2.2 times and achieves over 96\% detection efficiency for those originating from heavy seeds (HS). Furthermore, the network enables component mass estimation with relative uncertainties as low as $\sim 10^{-4}$ at the $2\sigma$ level. These improvements facilitate the assembly of a well-constrained population sample, allowing robust measurement of the fractional contributions from different formation pathways. The network achieves high precision in distinguishing between LS and HS origins (7.4\% relative uncertainty at $2\sigma$) and offers moderate discrimination between delay and no-delay channels in HS-origin binaries (24\%). However, classification remains challenging for delay versus no-delay scenarios in LS-origin systems (58\%) due to significant population overlap. In conclusion, the Taiji-TianQin network will serve as a powerful tool for unveiling the origins of SMBHs through GW population studies.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a general conjecture for evaluating multiple discontinuity integrals arising from bulk loop diagrams in the gravitational Schwinger-Keldysh geometry. This generalises earlier tree-level results in arXiv:2403.10654 to arbitrary bulk loops with no tadpoles (for scalar non-derivative interactions). The conjectured result takes the form of loop integrals performed in a real-time finite-temperature field theory living on the exterior of the black hole. We check our conjecture against all one-loop and many two and three-loop contributions to two, three, and four-point functions. Our diagrammatic rules for the exterior field theory are consistent with microscopic unitarity and thermality at arbitrary loop level. We also remark on a novel approach to real-time finite-temperature holography based on bulk Schwinger-Dyson equations, with the vertices integrated over the black hole exterior.

 In this study, we present a novel family of exact black hole solutions constructed in the context of five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity. These solutions add a non-linear charge to the Bañados-Teitelboim-Zanelli-like configurations known to exist with arbitrary Thurston horizon geometry. We establish constraints on the parameter space defining physically viable black holes, aligning with the standard energy conditions. An explicit proof of the first law of thermodynamics within our scenario is provided. We also employ holographic techniques to characterize the DC conductivities for the distinct horizon geometries, identifying a critical temperature indicative of phase transitions and exploring pertinent limits.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the hairy black hole solutions and their dual phase diagram in the improved holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) this http URL the gravitational perspective, the rich phase structures observed in the dual boundary field theory originate from the intricate interplay between the scalar field formalism and the Maxwell field coupling mechanism. Two distinct types of hairy black hole solutions are found in this framework. Type-I hairy black holes are predominantly governed by scalar potential dynamics, whereas Type-II solutions emerge through nonminimal coupling to the $U(1)$ gauge field. We map out the phase distribution in the $(\mu_B,T)$ parameter plane and delineate the boundary separating these two hairy phases. The phase diagram exhibits a first-order phase transition line consistent with previous findings, accompanied by a subtle third-order phase transition line that terminates at a critical point positioned at the turning point of the entire phase boundary curve. Our results complement existing research on holographic EMD theory by offering a comprehensive characterization of phase distributions, transition boundaries, and their gravitational sector interpretations. These insights will enable more effective engineering of specific phase structures for simulating strongly coupled systems through targeted modifications to the EMD model.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore spacetimes with multiple energy injections in asymptotically flat two-dimensional black hole and analyze the entanglement entropy in such spacetimes. This work is an extension of the setup of the single-injection case, by F.~F.~Gautason, L.~Schneiderbauer, W.~Sybesma and L.~Thorlacius, to include the multiple energy injections. We derive the solution of the model, by J.~G.~Russo, L.~Susskind and L.~Thorlacius, for a general number $n$ of the total injections, and discuss the entropy only for the case $n=2$. The essential point of this work is in the delay of the island. This delay makes the intermediate state necessary, where the island's endpoint lies between the 1st and the 2nd injections while the observer is located after the 2nd injection. The intermediate state makes the entanglement entropy evolve continuously across the 2nd injection time.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate radiation from near-extremal black holes formed by collapse, focusing on the role of large backreaction effects arising from gravitational fluctuations in the near-horizon region. Such effects have previously been identified from computations based on JT gravity and its Schwarzian description, most notably for the Euclidean partition function. Restricting attention to the s-wave sector, we integrate out gravity by solving the constraint equations in the Hamiltonian formalism, obtaining an effective scalar action with a coupling that grows at low temperature, thus enabling a real-time treatment of quantum backreaction. We then take initial steps toward evaluating the impact of this interaction on correlations of the outgoing radiation, and compare our findings with earlier results.

 - **Abstract**
 Heavy particle effective theory applied to spinning black holes provides a natural framework in which propagators linearize and numerators exponentiate. In this work, we exploit these two features to introduce Kerr generating functions, which describe the scattering of any probe on a Kerr black hole background to all loop orders. These generating functions can be used to perform the tensor reduction of multi-loop integrands simply by differentiation with respect to the spin. As a first application of the Kerr generating functions, we study a neutron star in a Kerr black hole background. We organize the integrand by the helicity configuration of the exchanged gravitons and provide compact all-loop-order results for several helicity sectors and a full four-loop $\mathcal{O}(G^5)$ result.
