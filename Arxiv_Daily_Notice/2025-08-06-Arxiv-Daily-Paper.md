#### Design and performance of "R-FLEX", a flexure-based fiber positioning robot for spectroscopic cosmology
 - **Authors:** Nicholas R. Wenner, Joseph H. Silber, David J. Schlegel
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02730

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02730

 - **Abstract**
 We present the design, fabrication, and testing of R-FLEX, a novel flexure mechanism for next-generation fiber-fed astronomical instruments. As the current Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) revolutionizes cosmology with over 56 million collected spectra using 5,000 robotic fiber positioners at 10.4 mm pitch, we project that future instruments will require 2.5-3x smaller fiber robots by area. R-FLEX enables precision radial motion for fiber robots mountable at 6.2 mm pitch, delivering repeatable positioning accuracy $\leq$ 5 $\mu$m over a 4 mm travel range. The travel range extends outside the robot's mechanical envelope, providing complete patrol coverage of the focal surface. The R-FLEX design must meet challenging requirements for parasitic motion < 30 $\mu$m, angular misalignment < 0.3°, 1 million cycle lifetime, operating in a mountaintop telescope environment, and is suitable for mass production of $\sim$30,000 units.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a suite of numerical simulations of tidal disruption events, using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, for a close binary system consisting of two low-mass white dwarfs, and an intermediate mass non-spinning black hole. The binary components are considered to be detached and on the same plane with the black hole. Our results quantify how the outcomes of these events depend crucially on the positional configuration of the binary components at the orbital pericenter, and we also show how distinctive behaviour for non-identical mass binaries arise, as compared to identical ones. We highlight these differences on observables such as mass fallback rates, kick velocities and gravitational waves, and also compute clump formation time within the stellar debris. In our setup, prograde binary motion, where the angular momentum of the binary is in the same direction as that of the center of mass motion around the black hole, is qualitatively similar to multiple events of single star tidal disruptions. However, we argue that interactions between stellar debris in the corresponding retrograde scenarios result in different and distinct outcomes. Our results should serve as indicative benchmarks in the observational aspects of tidal interactions between close white dwarf binaries and intermediate mass black holes.

#### Detectability of compact intermediate-mass black hole binaries as low-frequency gravitational wave sources: the influence of dynamical friction of dark matter

 - **Abstract**
 The black hole (BH) spin could significantly change the density of dark matter (DM) in its vicinity, creating a mini-spike of the density of DM. The dynamical friction (DF) between DM and the companion star of a BH can provide an efficient loss of angular momentum, driving the BH-main sequence (MS) star binary to evolve toward a compact orbit system. We investigate the influence of the DF of DM on the detectability of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH)-MS binaries as low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) sources. Taking into account the DF of DM, we employ the detailed binary evolution code MESA to model the evolution of a large number of IMBH-MS binaries. Our simulation shows that the DF of DM can drive those IMBH-MS binaries to evolve toward low-frequency GW sources for a low donor-star mass, a high spike index, or a short initial orbital period. When the spike index $\gamma=1.60$, those IMBH-MS binaries with donor-star masses of $1.0-3.4~ M_{\odot}$ and initial orbital periods of $0.65-16.82~ \rm days$ could potentially evolve into visible LISA sources within a distance of $10~\rm kpc$. The DF of DM can enlarge the initial parameter space and prolong the bifurcation periods. In the low-frequency GW source stage, the X-ray luminosities of those IMBH X-ray binaries are $\sim 10^{35}-10^{36}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$, hence they are ideal multimessenger objects.

#### Fast radio bursts as cosmic lightning

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03620

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03620

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new model for the origin of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), attributing these phenomena to sudden discharges of accumulated electric charge in the accretion disk of compact objects such as black holes. Our framework demonstrates how Compton scattering within the disk plasma generates charge separation, creating a capacitor-like system stabilized by the equilibrium between radiation pressure and electrostatic forces. We detail the discharge process through destabilizing mechanisms in this capacitor, resulting in radiative emission. We compare our model's prediction on radiation signatures with observational data, using FRB2018725A as an example to obtain key quantitative relationships. Additionally, we estimate the total charge buildup via Compton scattering for a stellar-mass black hole, constrained by the best-fit between our model and observations, and determine the corresponding electron density in the accretion disk for this mechanism to operate.

#### On the Efficiency of Producing Gamma-Ray Bursts from Isolated Population III Stars

 - **Abstract**
 The rate of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from isolated Pop III stars is not well known, as it depends on our poor understanding of their initial mass function (IMF), rotation rates, stellar evolution, and mass loss. A sub-population of massive ($M_{\rm ZAMS}\gtrsim20M_\odot$) Pop III stars is expected to suffer core-collapse and launch a relativistic jet that would power a GRB. In the collapsar scenario, a key requirement is that the pre-supernova star imparts sufficient angular momentum to the remnant black hole to form an accretion disc and launch a relativistic jet, which demands rapid initial rotation of the progenitor star and suppression of line-driven mass loss during its chemically homogeneous evolution. Here we explore a grid of stellar evolution models of Pop III stars with masses $20\leq M_{\rm ZAMS}/M_\odot \leq 100$, which are initially rotating with surface angular velocities $0.6\leq \Omega_0/\Omega_{\rm crit}\leq 0.9$, where centrifugally-driven mass loss ensues for $\Omega>\Omega_{\rm crit}$. Realistic accretion and jet propagation models are used to derive the initial black hole masses and spins, and jet breakout times for these stars. The GRB production efficiency is obtained over a phase space comprising progenitor initial mass, rotation, and wind efficiency. For modest wind efficiency of $\eta_{\rm wind}=0.45-0.35$, the Pop III GRB production efficiency is $\eta_{\rm GRB}\sim10^{-5}-3\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot^{-1}$, respectively, for a top-heavy IMF. This yields an observable all-sky equivalent rate of $\sim2-40\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ by \textit{Swift}, with 75\% of the GRBs located at $z\lesssim8$. If the actual observed rate is much lower, then this would imply $\eta_{\rm wind}>0.45$, which leads to significant loss of mass and angular momentum that renders isolated Pop III stars incapable of producing GRBs and favours a binary scenario instead.

#### Observing an accretion disk inside a wormhole shadow

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02752

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02752

 - **Abstract**
 The paper considers the problem of the possibility of observing an accretion disk through the throat of the Ellis-Bronnikov-Morris-Thorne wormhole. It is shown that this image has a complex structure and is fundamentally different from the image of an accretion disk around a black hole. Images of the accretion disk are presented at various angles between the plane of the disk and the observer's line of sight.

 - **Abstract**
 In the cosmological Robertson-Walker geometry required of the cosmological principle both the Weyl tensor $C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ and the Bach tensor $W^{\mu\nu}=[2\nabla_{\kappa}\nabla_{\lambda}-R_{\lambda\kappa}]C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ vanish. In general, in perturbations around the cosmological background neither of the fluctuating $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ or $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ would vanish. However, it is possible for $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ to vanish even as $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ does not. In this paper we construct an explicit model in which this is the case. The model consists of a tensor gravitational wave fluctuating around a background with a constant negative 3-curvature. The model is exactly solvable and consists purely of geometric quantities with no matter fields at all (i.e., $G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $W^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta W^{\mu\nu}=0$, where $G^{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor). The model can thus be created out of nothing, with creating a universe from nothing thus being an alternative principle to the cosmological principle. The fluctuating gravitational wave contributes to the temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background in a calculable manner, for which we provide a simple analytic way of treating spatial modes that is based on the use of a spatial mode addition theorem. In addition, we provide a treatment of the anisotropy that is based on properties of bandwidth limited functions.

#### On the viability of minimal Hořava gravity

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03106

 - **Abstract**
 Hořava gravity is a Lorentz-violating modification of general relativity (GR) with a preferred spacelike foliation. Observational evidence has put strong constraints on the parameter values in this model, so that the remaining viable sector is well-characterized by the Newton constant and a single additional parameter. We analyze this restricted theory, which is called minimal Hořava gravity ($\mathrm{mHg}$), from the Hamiltonian point of view. We find that in order to eliminate a pathological mode that is unstable at high frequencies and strongly coupled at low frequencies the theory must be further restricted so that the slices of the preferred foliation each have constant mean curvature. We dub this theory "minimal minimal Hořava gravity" ($\mathrm{m^2Hg}$). It has two regimes; one in which the mean curvature is time independent, in which case it is equivalent to a particular foliation of GR with nonzero cosmological constant, and another in which the mean curvature is time dependent. In the latter there is an infinite propagation speed since the lapse evolves via an elliptic equation, and the theory thus differs from GR in a peculiar nonlocal fashion. To probe the viability of the sector with time dependent mean curvature, we study in detail the problem of spherical collapse of a thin dust shell. The solution is determined unambiguously from initial conditions until the slice on which the shell first contracts to a point. Afterwards, there is an instantaneously propagating spherical mode with undetermined evolution, demonstrating a failure of the Cauchy problem.

#### Probing the Weak Gravity Conjecture: Novel Aschenbach Signatures in Superextremal Non-Linear Charged AdS Black Holes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03185

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the nonlinear charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole solution within the framework of massive gravity, motivated by recent advancements linking the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) to phenomena such as Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) and photon sphere dynamics. Building on these foundations, we focus on the Aschenbach effect-a relativistic phenomenon intricately tied to the geometry of photon spheres and known to occur in some special sub-extremal non rotating black holes. Our primary objective is to determine whether this effect persists not only up to the extremal limit but also beyond, into the superextremal regime, thus probing the stability and validity of black hole characteristics in these extreme conditions. By analyzing the nonlinear charged AdS black hole solutions in massive gravity, we demonstrate that the Aschenbach effect remains a robust feature across both extremal and superextremal configurations. This extension suggests that key relativistic signatures and the underlying spacetime structures associated with high-spin black holes continue to hold beyond classical boundaries. Our results provide new insights into the behavior of ultra-compact objects and highlight promising directions for exploring the limits of general relativity, as well as potential generalizations of the WGC and WCC in strong gravitational fields.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, the shadow and the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of an exact asymptotically flat hairy electrically charged black hole solution with a dilaton potential are investigated. Using the {constraint} equation among the integration constant $\eta$ of the gravitational field, the mass $M$, the electric charge $Q$ and the coupling constant $\nu$ between the $U(1)$ field and the dilaton field, we find that the shadow radii, the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ and the coordinate angular velocity $\Omega_{c}$ only significantly affected by $\nu$ if the $Q$ is close to the extremal value, especially when $\nu$ approaches to one. Furthermore, the QNMs are numerically computed by using the Hatsuda method and verify with the higher-order WKB approximations with the Padé summation. We find that the QNMs are close to that of the low energy limit of the string theory when $\nu$ is large enough. In the eikonal limit, the real and imaginary parts are proved to be given by $\Omega_{c}$ and $\lambda$, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 The KAGRA Collaboration has investigated a ten-year upgrade strategy for the KAGRA gravitational wave detector, considering a total of 14 upgrade options that vary in mirror mass, quantum noise reduction techniques, and the quality of cryogenic suspensions. We evaluated the scientific potential of these configurations with a focus on key targets such as parameter estimation of compact binary coalescences, binary neutron star post-merger signals, and continuous gravitational waves. Rather than aiming to improve all science cases uniformly, we prioritized those most sensitive to the detector configuration. Technical feasibility was assessed based on required hardware developments, associated R\&D efforts, cost, and risk. Our study finds that a high-frequency upgrade plan that enhances sensitivity over a broad frequency range above ~200 Hz offers the best balance between scientific return and technical feasibility. Such an upgrade would enable sky localization of binary neutron star mergers at 100 Mpc to better than 0.5 deg$^2$ in a LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network, and improve the measurement precision of tidal deformability parameter by approximately 10% at median, compared to a network without KAGRA.

#### Holographic F(Q,T) Gravity with Lambert Solution

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study a model of holographic dark energy using FLRW cosmology in the context of modified gravity. An extension of the symmetric teleparallel gravity is obtained by considering the gravitational action L is given by an arbitrary function f of the nonmetricity Q, where the nonmetricity Q is responsible for the gravitational interaction, and the trace of the matter energy momentum tensor T, so that L=f(Q,T). We expand on the features of the derived cosmological model in view of the relation between cosmic time and redshift as t(z)=kt0/b*f(z) where f(z) = W[b/k*e((b-ln(1+z))/k)] and W denotes the Lambert function, and discuss the evolution of the trajectories of the equation of state parameters and deceleration parameter in the evolving universe using a special then generalized version of the model.

#### Dynamics of Linear Scalar Perturbation in f(Q)+f(T) class of f(Q,T) gravity

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03495

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study the f(Q,T) model of symmetric teleparallel modified gravity in the framework of cosmological perturbation theory. Using a general approach, we extract the differential matter density equation then we simplify it as a second-order equation by considering the sub-Hubble approximation. Our analysis is then based on two different forms of f(Q,T) that we study in a classic approach and again using Holographic dark energy. Our initial results yield a significant divergence from the perturbed behavior of the LambdaCDM model, imposing stringent constraints on the feasibility of this class of theories but the HDE contribution triggers an interesting discussion.

#### Lyapunov exponents and phase transition of charged Ads black hole in quintessence

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03519

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the phase transitions of RN-AdS black holes immersed in a quintessence field, employing Lyapunov exponents as a dynamical probe to characterize the thermodynamics of black hole. Incorporating quintessence dark energy into the RN-AdS framework, we find that the Lyapunov exponents for null and timelike geodesics display diminished chaotic behavior with increasing normalization factor of the quintessence field. This feature introduces a finite cutoff to the Lyapunov exponent of unstable circular photon orbits, setting it apart from RN-AdS black hole. At phase transition points, both the free energy and Lyapunov exponents display multivalued branches, reflecting the coexistence of distinct black hole phases. Furthermore, the discontinuity in the Lyapunov exponent can serve as an order parameter with a critical exponent of $1/2$ near the critical point, consistent with the thermodynamic criticality of van der Waals fluids.. These work suggest that Lyapunov exponents provide a framework for probing the thermodynamics of black holes.

#### The $1/c$ expansion of general relativity in a $3+1$ formulation, revisited

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03548

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03548

 - **Abstract**
 We study the $1/c$ expansion of general relativity within a formulation that is compatible with both the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner and the Kol-Smolkin decompositions. The Einstein-Hilbert action takes a common form for those decompositions as they are dual to each other. We first develop a method to expand this generic form and then push the expansion up to $c^{-3}$ order within this novel approach. Next, we apply our technique to the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner decomposition and expand it up to $c^{-3}$ order explicitly. In order to demonstrate the applicability of our method and to highlight the duality at the level of expansion, we also perform the expansion in the Kol-Smolkin decomposition up to $c^{-1}$ order. Lastly, we make some all-order observations.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03615

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates gravitational lensing in the strong deflection limit, focusing particularly on higher-order images produced near compact objects such as black holes and their observable impact through the visibility function. Employing a robust parametrization framework proposed by Rezzolla and Zhidenko, the study systematically explores deviations from the Schwarzschild metric. A detailed theoretical analysis of interferometric observables is provided, highlighting how higher-order images imprint distinctive, measurable patterns in the visibility function, notably characterized by a staircase-like structure. By parametrically varying metric coefficients, the analysis reveals clear dependencies between spacetime deviations and key observational signatures, specifically the step heights and periodicities in the interferometric visibility. The results enhance the theoretical groundwork for interpreting data from advanced interferometric observations, potentially enabling precise tests of general relativity and the discrimination among alternative gravitational theories.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02785

 - **Abstract**
 We study tidal Love numbers of static black holes in four-dimensional quadratic theory of gravity, extending the result of GR. We use worldline effective field theory (WEFT) methods to compute metric perturbations from one-point functions, treating the higher-derivative terms perturbatively. We show that insertions of scalar fields on the worldline induce non-zero tidal tails, and the corresponding Love number displays no RG running. The same conclusion holds for the insertions of tensor fields. Furthermore, for scalar dipole perturbations, we derive a Yukawa-deformed Frobenius solution and match the asymptotic behavior to fix the UV charge, finding agreement with EFT predictions of Wilson coefficients. Our work demonstrates that quadratic higher-curvature corrections induce non-zero but scale-independent tidal responses, offering a robust EFT framework to test deviations from GR in gravitational wave observations.

#### ETH-monotonicity and the black hole singularity

 - **Abstract**
 ETH-monotonicity is a recently discovered quantum advantage in quantum chaotic many-body systems which reinforces the Kelvin statement of the second law of thermodynamics over and above the universal entropic contribution. We show that the boundary conformal field theory in AdS/CFT correspondence possesses ETH-monotonicity. This leads to our proposal that the black hole singularity is a microstate for which ETH-monotonicity dominates the entropic factor.

#### Timelike Liouville theory and AdS$_3$ gravity at finite cutoff

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03236

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03236

 - **Abstract**
 We propose that AdS$_3$ gravity with conformal boundary conditions is described by coupling the holographic CFT to timelike Liouville theory and deforming by an exactly marginal operator. In this description, the Liouville field controls the finite-cutoff radial wall in the bulk. We check this proposal in the semiclassical limit by matching the sphere and torus partition functions between the bulk and boundary theories. By scaling parameters of the Liouville theory we can push our bulk description deep inside the interior of black hole geometries. The same scaling of parameters leads to a flat-space limit with a two-dimensional CFT as its holographic dual theory.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.03386

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a consistent three-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory as a vector-tensor theory within the generalized Proca class by employing a regularization procedure based on the Weyl geometry, which was introduced recently in arXiv:2504.13084. We then obtain an asymptotically AdS$_3$, static, and circularly symmetric black hole solution with primary Proca hair. Afterwards, we investigate the effect of the scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet coupling constructed previously by different regularization schemes. We further generalize these solutions by incorporating an electric charge.

#### Regulator and gauge dependence of the Abelian gauge coupling in asymptotically safe quantum gravity

 - **Abstract**
 Both General Relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics are not UV complete. General Relativity is perturbatively non-renormalizable, while the Standard Model features Landau poles, where couplings are predicted to diverge at finite energies, e.g., in the Abelian gauge sector. Asymptotically safe quantum gravity may resolve both of these issues at the same time. In this paper, we assess the systematic uncertainties associated with this scenario, in particular with the gravitationally induced UV-completion of the Abelian gauge sector. Specifically, we study the dependence of this qualitative feature, namely the existence of a UV-complete gauge sector, on unphysical choices like the gauge, and the regulator function. Intriguingly, in some scenarios, we find simultaneous points of minimal sensitivity relative to both the regulator and gauge parameters, which allow for a UV completion. This provides further indications that the simultaneous UV-completion of quantum gravity and matter via an asymptotically safe fixed point is a robust physical feature, and that physical quantities, like scaling exponents, can become independent of unphysical choices.
