 - **Abstract**
 One of the most surprising results of early James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations is the discovery of an abundance of red, compact, broad-line objects dubbed "little red dots" (LRDs) at $z>4$. Their spatial density ($\sim10^{-4}$-$10^{-5}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$) is 100 times more abundant than UV-selected quasars at those redshift if one extrapolates the quasar luminosity function (QLF) down to the LRD regime. However, whether LRDs dominate black hole accretion at quasar-like luminosities ($L_\mathrm{bol}\gtrsim 10^{45-46}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) remains unanswered, as probing the bright end of the LRD luminosity function requires a much larger area than those able to be surveyed by JWST. In this work, we present our search for the brightest LRDs ($K<23.7$) at $4.5<z<4.9$ using wide-area multiwavelength imaging surveys from the near-UV to the infrared bands. With over 15 square degrees of sky coverage, we only identify one single LRD candidate at $z_\mathrm{phot}\approx4.6$, which translates into a spatial density of $n(M_{5100}<-23.5)\approx10^{-8}\,\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ -- this is nearly 10 times less abundant than the UV-selected quasars at similar optical luminosity. When combined with the LRD sample identified by JWST at the same redshift range, we find a sharp cutoff in the optical luminosity function at $\lambda L_{5100}\approx2.5\times10^{44}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$, while the QLF turnover occurs at $\gtrsim20$ times higher luminosity. We therefore confirm the exclusively low-luminosity nature of LRDs, ruling out that LRDs are the counter parts of quasars. Furthermore, we speculate that, if the shape of the luminosity function holds up, it points to LRDs being powered by low-mass black holes with a narrow range of Eddington-level accretion rates.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a previously unknown population of compact, red galaxies at $z \sim 5$, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). With effective radii of $\sim 100$ pc and stellar masses of $10^9-10^{11} \, \rm M_\odot$, a purely stellar interpretation implies extreme central densities, $\rho_\star\sim10^4-10^5 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$ and in some cases up to $\sim 10^9 \, \rm M_\odot \, pc^{-3}$, far exceeding those of globular clusters. At such densities, the dynamical friction time for $10 \, \rm M_\odot$ stars in the central $0.1$ pc is $< 0.1$ Myr, driving rapid mass segregation. We investigate the dynamical consequences of such an environment using: (i) a Fokker-Planck analysis of long-term core evolution, (ii) an analytical model for the collisional growth of a very massive star (VMS), and (iii) direct $N$-body simulations. All approaches show that runaway collisions produce a VMS with mass $9\times10^3 < M_{\rm VMS} \, [\rm M_\odot] < 5\times10^4$ within $<1$ Myr. Once the supply of massive stars is depleted, the VMS contracts on a $\sim 8000$ yr Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale and undergoes a general relativistic collapse, leaving a massive black hole of mass $M_\bullet \sim 10^4 \, \rm M_\odot$. We conclude that LRDs are natural nurseries for the formation of heavy black hole seeds via stellar-dynamical processes. This pathway produces seed number densities that far exceed those expected from direct collapse models, and, owing to the dense residual stellar core, can sustain high rates of tidal disruption events.

#### Baryonic Ecosystem IN Galaxies (BEINGMgII) -- III. Cool gas reservoirs at $0.3 \le z \le 1.6$ in the Dark Energy Survey

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the origin of intervening cool MgII absorption detected in the spectra of background quasars and the nature of associated galaxies across a broad redshift range of $0.3 \le z \le 1.6$. Using nebular [O II] $\lambda\lambda$3727,3729 emission lines identified in DESI fiber spectra centered on quasar, we detect 377 galaxies at a typical detection rate of $\sim$0.45% at $z \lesssim 1$, which increases with MgII equivalent width ($W_{2796}$). A significant fraction (74%) of these galaxies are associated with strong absorbers with $W_{2796} \ge$ 2Å. These absorbers trace galaxies spanning stellar masses of $\rm 8.4 \le \log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \le 11.6$ and star formation rates (SFRs) of $\rm -1.2 \le log(SFR~[M_{\odot}yr^{-1}]) \le 2.7$, located at projected galactocentric distances of 4-24 kpc. We find the average MgII absorber strength increases from 2.1Å to 2.9Å between redshifts $z \sim$ 0.4 and 1.2, indicating evolution in the cool gas content of galaxy halos. The relatively constant absorber strength with galactocentric distance implies a clumpy structure of cool gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Further, we find a positive correlation between $W_{2796}$ versus $M_\star$, and SFR, suggesting that the distribution of metal-enriched cool gas in the CGM is closely tied to the properties of the host galaxies. The redshift evolution of gas-phase metallicity suggests that strong MgII absorbers trace the general population of star-forming galaxies. The velocity dispersion of the cool gas increases with halo mass, and the wide range of line of sight velocity offset (-389 to 364 $\rm km\ s^{-1}$) between the galaxy systemic velocity and absorbers highlights the dynamical nature of CGM. However, the majority of this gas remains gravitationally bound to the dark matter halos, consistent with a picture of gas recycling via galactic fountains.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic ray (CR) feedback in galaxy evolution has seen a theoretical resurgence in the past decade, but significant uncertainties remain in CR transport through the interstellar and circum-galactic media (ISM and CGM). While several works indicate CR effects may be notable in both star-forming and quenched massive galaxies, modeling the vast CR transport parameter space currently allowed by observations is computationally restrictive to survey. Analytic treatments of CR feedback have provided useful insights to potential ramifications in different regimes, but have relied on time-steady assumptions which may not well characterize CR effects at different cosmic epochs and galaxy mass scales. We present semi-analytic and numerical solutions describing the time-dependent evolution of CR pressure in the CGM under simplified assumptions, which allow for quick evaluation of the vast allowable CR transport parameter space. We demonstrate that time-dependent injection from bursty star formation and/or episodic black hole accretion can substantially alter CR pressure profiles, particularly in the outer halos of massive galaxies ($\gtrsim R_{vir}$). Our work further suggests that CR feedback may play a significant role in shaping the matter distribution around massive galaxies ($\gtrsim M_{\textrm{halo}} \sim 10^{13} M_\odot$), and we speculate that these time-dependent effects may connect to observed phenomena like ``Odd Radio Circles". Finally, we benchmark our semi-analytic formalism against a cosmic ray-magnetohydrodynamic (CR-MHD) cosmological zoom-in galaxy simulation directly modeling the CR scattering rate and emergent transport in full generality, highlighting the validity of our approach. We conclude by motivating careful consideration of time-dependent ``softening" effects in sub-grid routines for CR feedback, particularly for use in large cosmological volumes.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that dark energy may be dynamical rather than being a mere cosmological constant $\Lambda$. In this work, we examine the viability of two physically well-motivated dynamical dark energy models -- holographic dark energy (HDE) and Ricci dark energy (RDE) -- by confronting them with the latest observational data, including ACT cosmic microwave background anisotropies, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations, and DESY5 supernovae. Our analysis reveals a fundamental tension between early- and late-universe constraints within both frameworks: ACT favors a quintom scenario where the dark energy equation of state (EoS) evolves from $w>-1$ at early times to $w<-1$ at late times, while DESI+DESY5 exhibits a distinct preference for quintessence where $w>-1$ across cosmic evolution. The joint analysis yields constraints that align more closely with the ACT preference. Critically, the canonical RDE model fails to provide a coherent description of cosmic evolution, as it manifests severe tensions (even exceeding $10\sigma$ significance) between early- and late-universe parameter reconstructions. Based on the combined data, Bayesian evidence decisively disfavors both HDE and RDE models relative to the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model, with ACT providing decisive disfavor and DESI+DESY5 yielding moderate disfavor. Our results show that the HDE and RDE models remain excluded by the new data, reinforcing earlier conclusions drawn from previous datasets.

#### Revisiting the supermassive black hole mass of NGC 7052 using high spatial resolution molecular gas observed with ALMA

 - **Abstract**
 We present our dynamical mass constraints on the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the early-type galaxy NGC 7052 using high spatial-resolution observations of $^{12}$CO(2-1) emission from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The data were obtained during ALMA Cycle 7 and have a synthesized beam size of 0''.29 $\times$ 0''.22 (97 $\times$ 73 pc$^2$). The dynamical model yielded an SMBH mass of $\approx (2.50 \pm 0.37 \, [{\rm statistical}] \pm 0.8 \, [{\rm systematic}]) \times 10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ and a stellar-$I$ band mass-to-light ratio of $\approx 4.08 \pm 0.23\, [{\rm statistical}] \pm 0.4 \, [{\rm systematic}]$ M$_{\odot}$/L$_{\odot}$ ($3\sigma$ confidence intervals). Although our new ALMA observation has three times lower spatial resolution than previous ALMA data, it still resolves the SMBH's sphere of influence with a spatial resolution that is 1.5 times smaller than this sphere radius. While our $M_{\rm BH}$ estimate is fully consistent with the previous determination, the $I$-band mass-to-light ratio is lower by 10%. This difference arises from our improved galaxy mass model, which incorporates both the molecular gas distribution and the extended stellar mass in the outer regions of the galaxy, components that were previously neglected.

#### The $R^2$-Higgs inflation: $R^3$ contribution and preheating after ACT and SPT data

 - **Abstract**
 The $R^2$-Higgs inflation is one of the simplest yet best-fit models consistent with Planck data. The higher spectral index $n_s$ recently reported by the combined cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), South Pole Telescope (SPT), and Planck, along with baryonic acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), disfavors the single-field-like regime of $R^2$-Higgs inflation at approximately $2\sigma$. Following a doubly covariant formalism, we show that the $R^2$-Higgs inflation, when modified by a dimension-six $R^3$ term, can account for the high $n_s$ reported by CMB+BAO. In this regard, we find that preheating may play a pivotal role. We also show that if the nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar $R$ and the Higgs field is $\mathcal{O}(10)$, then preheating via the production of Higgs quanta may help explain the reported observations.

 - **Abstract**
 To fulfill the requirements of space object cataloging and enable automated intelligent responses to anomalous events, we designed a novel observation scheduling system named Sky Survey Schedule (SSS). This framework facilitates coordinated operations across multi-site observational networks comprising dozens of instruments, while simultaneously supporting asteroid monitoring and time-domain astronomy studies. The system implements two principal observation modes: fixed sky regions and target-centered tracking. The former is used for sidereal or static observation, while the latter provides dedicated follow-up capabilities for transient targets. The sky regions are divided into latitude bands, each of which is subdivided into sectors to ensure minimal overlap and comprehensive coverage. These sectors are mapped to high-level HEALPix sky grids, enabling rapid cross-referencing and correlation between instruments. At the core of SSS lies an adaptive weighting architecture that integrates multiple parameters. Initial target priorities are determined from orbital catalogs containing both known and uncorrelated objects according to cataloging requirements. The system implements dynamic weight adjustments through feedback mechanisms: confirmed stable objects receive decaying weights, long-unobserved targets experience weight recovery, while anomalies (e.g., newly detected or lost objects) trigger priority escalation. These target-specific weights combine with observational factors - including phase angle constraints, lunar interference, Earth shadowing, and elevation limits - to generate space-time priority matrices. This quantitative framework systematically incorporates operator-defined priorities for specific regions/targets through configurable weight modifiers. Observation plans are dynamically optimized considering:....

 - **Abstract**
 Recently James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have observed an excess of luminous galaxies at high redshifts ($z \gtrsim 10$). In this work, we investigate whether supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) can explain it by their influence on the ultraviolet luminosity function (UV LF) of high-redshift galaxies. Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we constrain the parameters relevant with SMPBHs against current JWST observational data. The results reveal that SMPBHs with masses $M_{\rm PBH} \sim 10^{6.3\text{-}8.3} M_\odot$, abundances $f_{\rm PBH} \sim 10^{-7}\text{-}10^{-5}$, and sub-Eddington ratios $\lambda_E \ll 1$ can effectively enhance the bright end of the UV LF, consistent with JWST observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past decade, a significant amount of effort has been put into investigating the ultraviolet (UV) and optical variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Comprehensive studies of intensive multi-wavelength monitoring and surveys of local and high-redshift AGNs have shown that X-ray illumination of AGN accretion discs is a potential explanation for the observed variability. Our main objective is to study the UV/optical power spectra of AGNs under the assumption of X-ray reverberation and to test whether this model can explain the observed power spectra of distant quasars. To do this, we computed the disc transfer function in the case of X-ray reverberation using a recent physical model and studied its dependence on the parameters of the model. This model allows us to explore the variability of X-ray illuminated discs under the scenario in which the X-ray corona is powered by the accretion process or by an external source. We then calculated UV/optical power spectra using the disc transfer function and assuming a bending power law for the X-ray power spectrum. We fitted our models to the observed power spectra of quasars determined by a recent power spectrum analysis of the SDSS Stripe-82 light curves. We demonstrate that X-ray reverberation can fit the power spectra of quasars in our sample well at all wavelengths, from $\sim 1300$Å up to $4000$Å. Our best-fit models imply that the X-ray corona is powered by the accretion disc, and that the black hole spin is probably lower than 0.7, while the X-ray corona height is in the range of $20 - 60 R_{g}$. This is in agreement with previous findings from the application of the X-ray reverberation model to the quasar micro-lensing disc size problem, as well as recent time-lag measurements.

#### A two-phase model of galaxy formation: IV. Seeding and growing supermassive black holes in dark matter halos

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03283

 - **Abstract**
 We present a theoretical framework for seeding and growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dark-matter halos along their assembly histories. Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the ${\rm H}_2$-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of $M_{\rm BH} = 10$--$10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ at $z \approx 20$--$30$ in mini-halos with masses of $10^5$--$10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Nuclear bursts provide the key condition for seeds to grow into SMBHs. The $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent function shaped by the interplay among different growth channels. Our model predictions are broadly consistent with existing observations; especially, a population of BHs reminiscent of `little red dots' (LRDs) discovered by JWST naturally results from the seeding and growing processes. Potential future tests of the model are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 Nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs) from supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs), detectable via pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), offer a novel avenue to constrain dark energy. Based on cosmological simulations and semi-analytic galaxy formation models, this study explores the detectability of individual nanohertz SMBBH sources using next-generation PTAs and their potential for constraining dark energy under an optimistic scenario considering only the presence of white noise. By constructing light-cone SMBBH populations across hardening timescales ($\tau_H = 0.1/5/10$Gyr) and computing signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), we find advanced PTAs can resolve $10^2$--$10^3$ sources with SNR $> 8$ (primarily at $z < 1$ with chirp masses of $10^8$--$10^{10}M_{\odot}$). If electromagnetic counterparts can be identified, optimal configurations ($\sigma_t = 50$ns, $N_p = 1000$, $T_{\text{obs}} = 30$yr with$ \tau_H \leq 5$Gyr) could constrain the dark energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameter $w$ to $\Delta w \sim 0.023$--$0.048$, where the constraints only exhibit weak dependence on $\tau_H$ within $0.1$--$5$Gyr. If only $10\%$ of GW sources have detectable electromagnetic counterparts, constraints weaken to $\Delta w = 0.075$ ($\tau_H = 0.1$Gyr) and $\Delta w = 0.162$ ($\tau_H = 5$Gyr) under the most optimal parameter configuration. What's more, conservative PTAs ($N_p = 500$, $\sigma_t = 100$--$200$ns) with additional $30$-year data accumulation could double resolvable source counts and improve $\Delta w$ precision by $\sim 40\%$.

 - **Abstract**
 The firm co-existence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, $M_{\rm BH} \approx 10^3-10^6 M_odot$) in nuclear star clusters (NSCs) remains uncertain because the limited number of verified instances within the local Universe, limited within 3.5 Mpc. They are crucial for our understanding about the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The upcoming Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) promises to revolutionize the detection of these mysterious objects. In this study, we simulated the kinematics of an IMBH within the nuclear star cluster of VCC 1861, one of the faintest galaxies in the Virgo Cluster. Using Jeans Anisotropic Modeling (JAM) and stellar density profiles derived from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data and the HSIM program, we created mock High Angular Resolution Monolithic Optical and Near-infrared Integral field spectrograph (HARMONI) observations for the ELT. We then extract stellar kinematics from these mock data and recover the BH mass using the JAM model with Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation method. Our results demonstrate the ELT's capability to detect IMBHs with masses comprising 5% of the NSC's mass at the distance of the Virgo Cluster.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe some properties of the hyperbolically symmetric black hole (hereafter referred to as the $HSBH$) proposed a few years ago. We start by explaining the main motivation behind such an idea, and we determine the main differences between this scenario and the classical black hole (hereafter referred to as the $CBH$) scenario. Particularly important are the facts that, in the $HSBH$ scenario, (i) test particles in the region inside the horizon experience a repulsive force that prevents them from reaching the center, (ii) test particles may cross the horizon outward only along the symmetry axis, and (iii) the spacetime within the horizon is static but not spherically symmetric. Next, we examine the differences between the two models of black holes in light of the Landauer principle and the Hawking results on the eventual evaporation of the black hole and the paradox resulting thereof. Finally, we explore what observational signature could be invoked to confirm or dismiss the model.

 - **Abstract**
 The Einstein-Cartan (EC) theory of gravity provides a natural extension of general relativity by incorporating spacetime torsion to account for the intrinsic spin of matter. In this work, we investigate Yukawa-Casimir traversable wormholes supported by three distinct Yukawa-Casimir energy density profiles within the framework of EC gravity. The resulting shape functions are shown to satisfy all the fundamental requirements for traversable wormhole geometries. Our analysis reveals that the presence of exotic matter is unavoidable in sustaining these wormholes, and we quantify its total amount through the volume integral quantifier. Furthermore, the equilibrium of the wormhole configurations is established by examining the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. To enhance the physical relevance of the present work, we study several key features of the wormholes, including the embedding surface, proper radial distance, tidal forces, and total gravitational energy. In addition, we analyze the optical properties of wormholes by examining both the shadow and the strong deflection angle. All the findings collectively demonstrate the physical plausibility of Yukawa-Casimir traversable wormholes within the EC gravity framework.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we study the weak gravitational lensing in the background of regular, static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions of Einstein's standard general relativity coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics. The weak deflection angles are estimated in the context of vacuum medium and plasma medium using the Gauss-Bonnet method. The obtained deflection angles decrease as the impact parameter $b$ and the charge parameter $q$ increase, while the deflection angles increase gradually with increasing values of the black hole mass $m$. Moreover, the effect of a plasma medium has increased the deflection angle than the vacuum medium scenario. We also estimate the time delay in the field of the described black holes that vanishes for $m = q =0$, i.e., the absence of the black holes. The shadow cast of the present black holes is also analyzed with respect to the impact $q$ and mass $m$, which ensures that the shadow region shrinks for increasing values of $q$ and expands for increasing values of $m$. In addition, we estimated the rigorous bounds of the greybody factor $\mathcal{T}_b$ for the described black holes and the graphical analysis ensures that the increasing charge parameter $q$ decreases the rigorous bound of $\mathcal{T}_b$ and the increasing mass $m$ increases the rigorous bound of $\mathcal{T}_b$.

 - **Abstract**
 A spherically symmetric black hole solution defined by the gravitational mass is explored in higher-order curvature gravity associated with a scalar field. It is demonstrated that the singularities of the curvature invariants will be far weaker around the central region of the black hole than those in general relativity, owing to the effect originating from higher-order curvatures with the coupling to a dynamical scalar field. Furthermore, thermodynamic properties and the Davies-type phase transition of the black hole are investigated for Barrow entropy with a quantum effect of gravitation. It is found that both the quasi-local energy and Gibbs free energy are positive, and the black hole can hence be stable on the smooth horizon surface. In addition, by analyzing the geodesic deviation, the stability conditions of the black hole are explicitly shown.

 - **Abstract**
 Schwarzschild black-hole interiors, bounded by event horizons and terminated by spacelike singularities, are regions where all physical observers are inevitably destroyed. However, the behavior of wave propagation in such extreme habitats remains rich and nuanced. In this work, we show that axial gravitational perturbations in the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole can form overdamped (non-oscillatory) quasibound states that persist without ever reaching the singularity. Using Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates to avoid coordinate ambiguities, we identify these modes and analyze their eigenfunctions. Contrary to earlier claims, we find that the Regge-Wheeler master function of these modes have non-zero amplitude at the future event horizon but decay before interacting with the singularity. We consider observations of the modes along timelike geodesics. This work suggests that certain gravitational fluctuations can hover transiently within the black-hole interior, challenging common assumptions about wave behavior in uncharted and extreme regions of spacetime.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the chaotic behavior of a phenomenological system of rotating black holes (BHs) surrounded by radiation, dust, and dark matter as effective matter fluids. We show that the chaos bound is saturated -- but never violated -- when the density parameter $k \rightarrow 1$, which corresponds to a high dark matter concentration in the halo. This saturation is independent of radiation and dust density, occurring in the low-temperature regime where the BH's surface gravity and Hawking temperature decrease. Our results suggest that rotating BHs subjected to a phenomenological representation of a more realistic matter environment can scramble information as efficiently as allowed by physical laws in this limit. This work links quantum chaos research with phenomenological BH-matter configurations, providing a motivation for studies of chaos in astrophysical BHs.

 - **Abstract**
 The basic and conceptual notion of this work starts from the recent investigations of Marios Christodoulou and Carlo Rovelli (CR) in their paper entitled ''How big is a black hole?''. This work is related to the black hole interior volume and the entropy by Baocheng Zhang. In CR work, a spherically symmetric Schwarzschild black hole is considered and defines the interior volume, as the volume inside a sphere $S$ is the maximal proper volume of a space-like spherically symmetric $3d$ hypersurface bounded by the sphere $S$. Using this definition, they found the interior volume of a black hole is proportional to the advanced time. This is the main characteristic of this formulation. Which means that a black hole could store a large amount of infalling information. Using this special property, one can prob the nature of Hawking radiation emitted by a black hole. They also extend their result to the charged static black hole and found a consistent result. Their numerical analysis showed that the special character of this formulation is that the volume linearly increases with advancing time. Later, the CR work is followed by Baocheng Zhang, who investigated the entropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of the Schwarzschild Black hole. He found the entropy of scalar quantum modes in the interior of Black hole is proportional to the lack hole surface area. The proportionality constant is found to be less than unity, which means that the interior entropy is less as compared to the Bekenstein Hawking entropy (horizon entropy). Note that these analyses are only applicable for black holes with mass greater than the Planck mass. If massless than Planck's mass, then one needs to understand the uncertainty relation.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explore quasibound states (QBS), scalar cloud, Hawking radiation, superradiance, and greybody factor of relativistic massive phonon modes in a photon-fluid rotation black hole. We investigate quasibound states and scalar clouds using exact eigensolutions to the analog Klein-Gordon equation in the analog black hole background and revisit the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) upper bound on the scalar clouds' energy ratio. Using the obtained exact radial solution, we use the Damour-Ruffini method to calculate the power spectrum of the analog black hole's Hawking radiation. We then use the analytical asymptotic matching technique (AAM) to investigate the analog black hole's superradiance for low energy massive photon scattering, resulting in the analytical amplification factor and the greybody factor formulas of the analog black hole. We discover that the analog black hole in the photon-fluid model is superradiant with an energy range of $\varpi < \omega<m_\ell\Omega_H$. As a result, the greybody factors are negative for co-rotating modes in the superradiant regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Assuming a sufficiently general form for the matter distribution function of a galactic halo, we have derived solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations describing a charged black hole embedded in such a halo, while also allowing for a non-zero cosmological constant. These solutions generalize our earlier results for neutral black holes in asymptotically flat spacetime. As specific realizations of the general distribution, we consider the Hernquist, Navarro-Frenk-White, Burkert, Taylor-Silk, and Moore halo profiles, thereby capturing a broad range of astrophysically motivated scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 We constructed the ghost-free condition for nonlocal gravity using de-Sitter background field expansion and identified the structure of the nontrivial form factors. Our analysis shows that the particle spectrum of this model is nearly equivalent to general relativity (GR), with the potential addition of a scalar particle with positive mass m. Additionally, by employing recursion relations, we established the equivalence between nonlocal gravity and higher-derivative gravity. Moreover, we provided a comprehensive non-perturbative proof of the stability of de-Sitter solution within the nonlocal framework.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observational confirmation of Hawking's black-hole area theorem using the newly released gravitational-wave data from the GWTC-4 catalog. We have analyzed two high signal-to-noise ratio binary black hole (BBH) merger events, including GW230814 and GW231226, from the first part of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4 run, and measured the (total) horizon area of the black holes before and after merger. For both events, the horizon area of the remnant black hole is found to be greater than the total horizon area of the two pre-merger black holes at a high possibility (effectively $\gtrsim 99\%$), and particularly with GW230814 we have a significance level of $\gtrsim 5\sigma$ for the {\it first} time. These results provide the direct convincing verification of the black-hole area law, further bolstering the validity of classical general relativity in the dynamical, strong-field regime.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the influence of perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) on Yang--Mills--inspired charged black holes, with a particular focus on the resulting modifications to key black hole observables. By embedding a PFDM term into the spacetime geometry, we examine the alterations in shadow morphology, photon geodesics, and the associated energy emission spectra. Our analysis reveals that PFDM induces notable deviations in the shadow size, shape, and circularity, and significantly impacts the stability of circular orbits. Furthermore, the energy emission rate exhibits a strong dependence on both the Yang--Mills charge and the dark matter distribution. These results indicate that environmental effects arising from dark matter can imprint observable signatures on black hole shadows and radiation processes, offering a potential pathway to constrain dark matter models and probe non-Kerr geometries with forthcoming high-precision observations such as those from the Event Horizon Telescope and next-generation interferometers.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the possibility of realizing a non-singular bounce in the early universe within the framework of modified gravity with spacetime torsion. In Einstein Cartan theory, torsion is embedded in the spacetime by adding an antisymmetric part in affine connection . We consider generalized version of the framework as $f(\bar{R})$, $\bar{R}$ being the scalar of the modified curvature tensor. $f(\bar{R})$ gravity is recast in Einstein frame as non-minimally coupled scalar tensor theory where the scalar field gets coupled with a rank 2 antisymmetric torsion field through derivative couplings. We investigate whether the introduction of three additional torsion-dependent terms in Einstein frame help to realize a bounce. We first explore this cosmological system in the background of a homogeneous and isotropic FRW spacetime but inclusion of the torsion terms are insufficient to produce a bounce in this symmetric setting. Motivated by this limitation, we relax the symmetry and generalize the background to include inhomogeneity and anisotropy. In this setup, the dynamics is modified in such a way that a bouncing solution is possible without invoking phantom fields or energy condition violations. We have also found the exact solutions of all the fields and reconstructed the modified gravity form.

 - **Abstract**
 String theory has strong implications for cosmology: it tells us that we cannot have a cosmological constant, that single-field slow-roll inflation is ruled out, and that black holes decay. We elucidate the origin of these statements within the string-theoretical swampland programme. The swampland programme is generating a growing body of insights that have yet to be incorporated into cosmological models. Taking a cosmologist's perspective, we highlight the relevance of swampland conjectures to black holes, dark matter, dark energy, and inflation, including their implications for scalar fields such as quintessence and axions. Our goal is to inspire cosmological model builders to examine the compatibility of effective field theories with quantum gravitational UV completions and to address outstanding cosmological tensions such as the Hubble tension. This comprehensive literature review presents clear definitions, cosmological implications, and the current status - including evidence and counterexamples - of the following swampland conjectures: the anti-de Sitter distance conjecture (AdSDC), the completeness conjecture (CC), the cobordism conjecture, the de Sitter conjecture (dSC), the swampland distance conjecture (SDC), the emergence proposal (EP), the Festina Lente Bound (FLB), the finite number of massless fields conjecture (or finite flux vacua conjecture (FFV)), the no global symmetries conjecture, the no non-supersymmetric theories conjecture, the non-negative null energy condition conjecture, the positive Gauss-Bonnet term conjecture, the species scale conjecture, the gravitino swampland conjecture (GSC), the tadpole conjecture, the tameness conjecture, the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture (tPCC/TCC), the unique geodesic conjecture, and the weak gravity conjecture (WGC), including the repulsive force conjecture (RFC).

#### Quantum Vacuum energy as the origin of Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the idea that quantum vacuum energy $\rho_{\rm vac} $ is at the origin of Gravity as a theoretical exercise. We formulate a gravitational version of the electromagnetic Casimir effect, and provide an argument for how gravity can arise from $\rho_{\rm vac} $ by showing how Einstein's field equations emerge in the form of Friedmann's equations. This leads to the idea that Newton's constant $G_N$ is environmental, namely it depends on the total mass-energy of the Universe $M_\infty $ and its size $R_\infty $, with $G_N = c^2 R_\infty /2 M_\infty$. This leads to a new interpretation of the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of de Sitter space, and also the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for black holes, wherein the quantum information bits are quantized massless particles at the horizon with wavelength $\lambda = 2 \pi R_\infty$. We assume a recently proposed formula for $\rho_{\rm vac} \sim m_z^4/\mathfrak{g}$, where $m_z$ is the mass of the lightest particle, and $\mathfrak{g}$ is a marginally irrelevant coupling. This leads to an effective, induced RG flow for Newton's constant $G_N$ as a function of an energy scale, which indicates that $G_N$ decreases at higher energies until it reaches a Landau pole at a minimal value of the cosmological scale factor $a(t) > a_{\rm min}$, thus avoiding the usual geometric singularity at $a=0$. We propose that this energy scale dependent $G_N$ can explain the Hubble tension and we thereby constrain the coupling constant $\mathfrak{g}$ and its renormalization group parameters. For the $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model we estimate $a_{\rm min} \approx e^{-1/\hat{b} }$ where $\hat{b} \approx 0.02$ based on the Hubble tension data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed study of the regularized on-shell action of the recently found asymptotically AdS$_7$ black hole supergravity solution with three angular momenta and two electric charges. We show that a particular choice of finite counterterms in the holographic renormalization procedure yields a result for the on-shell action of the supersymmetric limit of the black hole solution which is in perfect agreement with the large $N$ limit of the superconformal index of the dual 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ $A_{N}$ SCFT on $S^1\times S^5$. We also discuss a generalization of this 7d supergravity background to a new general family of black holes with horizons given by the $L^{p,q,r}$ 5d Sasaki-Einstein manifolds. The regularized on-shell action of these new 7d black holes is also in agreement with supersymmetric localization results for the 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ SCFT on $S^1\times L^{p,q,r}$. Finally, we briefly discuss a generalization of known AdS$_5$ gauged supergravity backgrounds to new 5d black holes with $L(p,q)$ lens space horizon topologies.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new approach for studying $d+1$ dimensional Euclidean Schwarzschild black holes with Hawking temperature near the Hagedorn temperature and Horowitz-Polchinski solutions. The worldsheet theory that describes some of these backgrounds is strongly coupled. We use its underlying affine $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ symmetry to continue to weak coupling, by varying the level of the current algebra from the small value relevant for black holes and HP solutions to a large value. In this limit, one can describe the dynamics by a solvable effective field theory, and the non-geometric features of the original problem are geometrized. The resulting construction is closely related to previous work on the non-abelian Thirring model, and sheds light on both problems.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we identify a novel topological subclass, dubbed $\widetilde{W}^{1+}$, in the thermodynamics of higher odd-dimensional, multiply rotating Kerr-AdS black holes. This discovery extends the established topological classification beyond the five classes and two subclasses previously known. The $\widetilde{W}^{1+}$ subclass exhibits a unique and previously unreported stability profile: it admits a thermodynamically stable small black hole state in the low-temperature limit, while in the high-temperature limit, the phase space simultaneously contains one stable large black hole, one stable small black hole, and one unstable small black hole state. Our analysis, which treats black hole solutions as topological defects, reveals a richer landscape of black hole thermodynamics than previously understood and necessitates an expansion of the topological classification scheme to accommodate this new phenomenology.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct exact analytic solutions for a supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory with matter fields in the adjoint representation (unconventional supersymmetry). The configurations correspond to gravitating spinor fields on BTZ geometries with torsion. Although the spinor profiles exhibit divergent behavior near the black hole horizon, they yield finite contributions to conserved charges. We demonstrate that the spinors solve the full nonlinear field equations and satisfy integrability conditions derived from the Bianchi identities. The resulting energy momentum tensor is traceless, consistent with the Weyl invariance of the theory. We also analyze spinor solutions based on $adS_3$ Killing spinors and identify the conditions under which such backgrounds can support nontrivial spinor configurations. Our findings open the way to new fermionic sectors in 3D gravity with torsion, distinct from previously known perturbative deformations.
