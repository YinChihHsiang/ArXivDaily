 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave lensing, particularly microlensing by compact dark matter (DM), offers a unique avenue to probe the nature of dark matter. However, conventional detection methods are often computationally expensive, inefficient, and sensitive to waveform systematics. In this work, we introduce the Wavelet Convolution Detector (WCD), a deep learning framework specifically designed to identify wave-optics diffraction patterns imprinted in gravitationally lensed signals. The WCD integrates multi-scale wavelet analysis within residual convolutional blocks to efficiently extract time-frequency interference structures, and is trained on a realistically generated dataset incorporating compact DM mass functions and astrophysical lensing probabilities. This work is the first machine learning-based approach capable of identifying such wave-optics signatures in lensed gravitational waves. Tested on simulated binary black hole events, the model achieves 92.2\% accuracy (AUC=0.965), with performance rising to AUC$\sim$0.99 at high SNR. Crucially, it maintains high discriminative power across a wide range of lens masses without retraining, demonstrating particular strength in the low-impact-parameter and high-lens-mass regimes where wave-optics effects are most pronounced. Compared to Bayesian inference, the WCD provides orders-of-magnitude faster inference, making it a scalable and efficient tool for discovering compact DM through lensed gravitational waves in the era of third-generation detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 The Einstein Probe is revolutionizing time-domain astrophysics through the discovery of new classes of X-ray transients associated with Type Ic-Broad Line supernovae. These events commonly exhibit bright early-time optical counterparts, and sudden afterglow rebrightening within the first week - features that existing models fail to explain. In particular, structured jet and cocoon scenarios are inconsistent with the observed sharp rebrightening and multi-day optical emission, while the refreshed shock model is ruled out due to its inconsistency with collapsar hydrodynamics. Drawing on 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we present the multi-scale angular and radial structure characterizing collapsar outflows. The resulting morphology features episodic, wobbling jets with a "top-hat" geometry, embedded within a smoother global cocoon and disk ejecta angular structure. The wobbling jets give rise to variations in radiative efficiency that can account for the observed alternation between X-ray-dominated and $\gamma$-ray-dominated jet emission. The top-hat structure of individual wobbling jet episodes naturally explains the sudden rebrightening observed when the emission from the top-hat jet cores enters the observer's line of sight. The radial structure is consistent with that inferred from observations of stripped-envelope supernovae. It comprises a mildly relativistic cocoon ($0.3\lesssim\beta\Gamma\lesssim3$) that may power an early ($\sim1\,{\rm day}$) rapidly decaying emission, followed by slower, black hole accretion disk-driven outflows ($\beta\lesssim0.3$), which dominate the slowly evolving optical emission at $t\gtrsim1\,{\rm day}$. This novel multi-component outflow structure provides a unified explanation for the multiband light curves observed in Einstein Probe transients and is likely a common feature of Type Ic-Broad Line supernovae more broadly.

#### Wide binaries in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy: discovery, population modeling, and a nail in the coffin of primordial black hole dark matter

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery and characterization of a wide binary population in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Boötes I using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our sample consists of 52 candidate binaries with projected separations of 7,000 - 16,000 au and stellar masses from near the hydrogen-burning limit to the main-sequence turnoff ($\sim0.1$ - $0.8~{\rm M_\odot}$). By forward-modeling selection biases and chance alignments, we find that $1.25\pm0.25\%$ of Boötes I stars are members of wide binaries with separations beyond 5,000 au. This fraction, along with the distributions of separations and mass ratios, matches that in the Solar neighborhood, suggesting that wide binary formation is largely insensitive to metallicity, even down to [Fe/H] $\approx -2.5$. The observed truncation in the separation distribution near 16,000 au is well explained by stellar flyby disruptions. We also discuss how the binaries can be used to constrain the galaxy's dark matter properties. We show that our detection places new limits on primordial black hole dark matter, finding that compact objects with $M \gtrsim 5~{\rm M_\odot}$ cannot constitute more than $\sim1\%$ of the dark matter content. In contrast to previous work, we find that wide binaries are unlikely to provide robust constraints on the dark matter profile of ultrafaint galaxies given the uncertainties in the initial binary population, flyby disruptions, and contamination from chance alignments. These findings represent the most robust detection of wide binaries in an external galaxy to date, opening a new avenue for studying binary star formation and survival in extreme environments.

#### X-ray investigation of possible super-Eddington accretion in a radio-loud quasar at $z=6.13$

 - **Abstract**
 We present radio and X-ray observations of the recently discovered $z=6.13$ radio-powerful quasar RACS J032021.44$-$352104.1 using uGMRT, ATCA, LBA, and Chandra. The observed radio properties are in line with what is typically observed in high-$z$ radio quasars ($\alpha_{\rm r}=0.72\pm 0.02$ and L$_{\rm 1.4GHz}=5.8 \pm 0.9 \times 10^{26}$ W Hz$^{-1}$). Despite the relatively low X-ray flux observed $F_{\rm 0.5-7.0 keV}=2.3\pm0.5 \times 10^{-14}$ erg sec$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, the intrinsic luminosity in the 2-10 keV rest frame is markedly high, $L_{\rm 2-10 keV}=1.8^{+1.1}_{-0.7} \times 10^{46}$ erg sec$^{-1}$, making RACS J032021.44$-$352104.1 one of the most luminous quasars currently known at $z>5.5$. The high X-ray luminosity is largely driven by an extrapolation to energies below the observable X-ray window with Chandra and the slope derived in the 0.5-7 keV band (or 3.5--50 keV in the rest-frame; $\Gamma_{\rm X}=3.3\pm0.4$). By analysing the overall spectral energy distribution of the quasar we found that the remarkably soft X-ray emission: (1) cannot be produced by relativistic jets, even when relativistic boosting is considered; and (2) is consistent with expectations for a super-Eddington accreting SMBH. If such a high accretion rate was confirmed, this source would be a unique laboratory to study high accretion in the early Universe and could help resolve some challenges inherent in early black hole growth paradigms.

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers, including the recent signals GW231123 and GW230529, have revealed multiple progenitor black holes in the so-called upper and lower mass gaps, respectively. It is generally assumed that massive stars cannot form black holes in the upper mass gap because pair instabilities in the late stage of stellar evolution disrupt the stars, whereas the lower mass gap refers to the gap between the maximum allowed neutron star mass and the smallest black hole mass expected to form in supernova explosions. Here we explore a "premature collapse" scenario in which upper mass gap stars collapse and form black holes before they reach the late stage of stellar evolution. The mechanism for triggering a premature collapse is the capture of a smaller black hole, possibly primordial in nature. A similar capture scenario can occur to produce black holes in the lower mass gap. At least for massive stars, typical stellar rotation rates would likely result in rapidly rotating black holes in such a scenario, naturally explaining the rapid spins inferred from GW231123. Even though our estimates hinge on several parameters with rather large uncertainties, they suggest that, at least in galactic disks, the likelihood of such a capture is small for stars in the upper mass gap, but may lead to a significant population of black holes in the lower mass gap and, in fact, even below the lower mass gap.

 - **Abstract**
 We combine near-infrared imaging in two bands from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) with archival observations of molecular gas to study SDSS J160705.16+533558.6 (J1607), an extremely luminous broad-line quasar at $z = 3.65$ that is also bright in the submillimeter (sub-mm). Via subtraction of the quasar point spread function, we show that its host galaxy is massive, with a stellar mass of $(5.8 \pm 3.0) \times 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$, making it comparable to giant early-type galaxies (ETGs) at $z\sim0$. If the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the quasar is accreting at the Eddington limit, then its mass is $3.5 \times 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is also consistent with local massive ETGs. The host has an extremely high star formation rate (SFR) of $4300 \pm 500$\sfr and a molecular gas mass of $(2.4 \pm 0.9)\times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$. The quasar has two companions: one at a projected separation of 11 kpc with a stellar mass of $(7.9 \pm 5.0) \times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ but no detected molecular gas, and one 6 kpc further away in the same direction with a molecular gas mass of $(2.6 \pm 1.3) \times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$ but no detected stellar emission. Since neither companion shows evidence for AGN activity, this may represent merger-driven quenching, in which the dynamics of the merger strip molecular gas from infalling galaxies. Overall, irrespective of whether the host is merging with the companions, these properties mark J1607 as forming what will become an extremely massive ($\sim10^{12}M_{\odot}$) galaxy by $z=0$.

#### Gravitational waves reveal the pair-instability mass gap and constrain nuclear burning in massive stars

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar evolution theory predicts that electron--positron pair production in the cores of massive stars triggers unstable thermonuclear explosions that prevent the direct formation of black holes above about $50\,M_\odot$, creating a ``pair-instability gap''. Yet black holes have been detected above this mass with gravitational waves; such objects might be explained with uncertainties in the physics of massive stars and stellar collapse or with hierarchical mergers of black holes in stellar clusters. Hierarchical mergers are associated with large spins as predicted by general relativity, and isotropic spin orientations. Here we present strong evidence for the pair-instability mass gap in the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA fourth transient catalog, with a lower edge at $45.3^{+6.5}_{-4.8}\,M_\odot$. We also obtain a measurement of the ${}^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma){}^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, yielding an $S$-factor of $242.5^{+310.4}_{-101.5}\,\mathrm{keV\,b}$, a parameter critical for modeling helium burning and stellar evolution. The new data reveal two populations: a low-spin group with no black holes above the gap, consistent with direct stellar collapse, and a high-spin, isotropic group that extends across the full mass range and occupies the gap, consistent with hierarchical mergers. These findings confirm the role of pair-instability in shaping the black hole spectrum, establish a new link between gravitational-wave astronomy and nuclear astrophysics, and highlight hierarchical mergers and star cluster dynamics as key channels in the growth of black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Angular momentum transport in high-mass stars is commonly modeled by extrapolating the behavior of better-observed low-mass stars. According to the conventional picture, the cores of most black hole progenitors lose almost all of their angular momentum when their outer layers are ejected before core collapse. Accordingly, most black holes are expected to be born with dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\chi \lesssim 0.01$, even if some black holes are born with non-negligible spin due to tidal interactions in a progenitor binary. One might therefore expect to find a large fraction of $\chi \lesssim 0.01$ black holes in merging binary black hole (BBH) systems. We find that the conventional picture of angular momentum transport is in tension with data from LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA's fourth gravitational-wave transient catalog. We find no support for a sub-population of BBH systems with $\chi \lesssim 0.01$. Neither do we find support for a sub-population with only one spinning black hole as expected for tidal spin-up scenarios. Instead, we find evidence for two subpopulations in which both black holes have non-negligible spin. Approximately 84% of BBH systems contain two black holes with modest spins $\chi \approx 0.1$ and approximately 16% contain two black holes with large spins $\chi \approx 0.8$. These estimates come from our best-fit model, which is favored with natural log Bayes factors $\ln B \gtrsim 3$ over models that require a sub-population of $\chi \lesssim 0.01$ black holes, and models that do not contain multiple spin sub-populations. These results are difficult to reconcile with our current understanding of angular momentum transport.

 - **Abstract**
 Stochastic inflation rests on the separate-universe approximation, i.e. the ability to describe long-wavelength fluctuations in an inflating universe as homogeneous perturbations of its background dynamics. Although this approximation is valid in most cases, it has been recently pointed out that it breaks down during transition periods between attractor and non-attractor phases. Such transitions are ubiquitous in single-field models giving rise to enhanced perturbations at small scales, that are required to form primordial black holes. The current inability to apply the stochastic-inflation program in such models is therefore one of the main obstacles to investigating the role of backreaction in primordial-black-hole scenarios. In this work, we show how gradient interactions can be incorporated in stochastic inflation, via a set of Langevin equations of higher dimension. We apply our formalism to a few cases of interest, including one with a sharp transition. In all cases, in the classical limit we show that gradient corrections as predicted from cosmological perturbation theory are properly recovered. We uncover the existence of a "pullback" effect by which the tails of the first-passage-time distributions are dampened by gradient interactions. We finally discuss the role of backreaction in the presence of gradient interactions.

#### The diverse quenching pathways of post-starburst galaxies in SDSS-IV MaNGA

 - **Abstract**
 The quenching of star formation in galaxies is an important aspect of galaxy evolution, but the physical mechanisms that drive it are still not understood. Measuring the spatial distribution of quenching can help determine these mechanisms. We present the star-formation histories (SFHs) and stellar metallicity evolution of rapidly quenched regions in 86 local post-starburst (PSB) galaxies from the MaNGA integral field survey, obtained through Bayesian full spectral fitting of their rest-frame optical spectra. We found that regardless of spatial location, the PSB regions have similar past SFHs and chemical evolution, once radial metallicity gradients are accounted for. This suggests that all PSB regions are regulated by a common set of local scale processes in the interstellar medium, regardless of the broader triggering mechanism. We show that the centres of galaxies with outer PSB regions are also quenching. The central specific star-formation rate (sSFR) has declined by $\sim1.0\;$dex on average during the last 2 Gyr, a significantly steeper decline than main sequence galaxies over the same period ($\approx0.2\;$dex). This central quenching can be either synchronous, outside-in or inside-out, and slower or as fast as the outer regions, highlighting the diversity of quenching pathways for local galaxies. Our results imply a primary quenching mechanism that is both catastrophic and global in rapidly halting star formation in local galaxies. We suggest the predominant cause is galaxy mergers or interactions, with large scale feedback from a starburst or a central supermassive black hole playing a lesser role.

#### A hybrid active galactic nucleus feedback model with spinning black holes, winds and jets

 - **Abstract**
 We present a hybrid active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback model that features three accretion disc states (the thick, thin, and slim discs at low, moderate, and super-Eddington accretion rates, respectively), and two feedback modes: thermal isotropic and kinetic jets. The model includes black hole (BH) spin evolution due to gas accretion, BH mergers, jet spindown, and Lense-Thirring torques. The BH spin determines the jet directions and affects the feedback efficiencies. The model is implemented in the SWIFT code and coupled with the COLIBRE galaxy formation model. We present the first results from hybrid AGN feedback simulations run as part of the COLIBRE suite, focusing on the impact of new parameters and calibration efforts. Using the new hybrid AGN feedback model, we find that AGN feedback affects not just massive galaxies, but all galaxies down to $M_*\approx10^8$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$. BH spins are predicted to be near-maximal for intermediate-mass BHs ($M_\mathrm{BH}\in[10^6,10^8]$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$), and lower for other BH masses. These trends are in good agreement with observations. The intergalactic medium is hotter and impacted on larger scales in the hybrid AGN feedback simulations compared to those using purely thermal feedback. In the hybrid AGN simulations, we predict that half of the cumulative injected AGN energy is in thermal and the other half in jet form, broadly independent of BH mass and redshift. Jet feedback is important at all redshifts and dominates over thermal feedback at $z<0.5$ and $z>1.5$, but only mildly.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate interacting dark energy (IDE) models with phenomenological, non-linear interaction kernels $Q$, specifically $Q_{1}=3H\delta \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm dm}\rho_{\rm de}}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$, $Q_{2}=3H\delta \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm dm}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$, and $Q_{3}=3H\delta \left(\frac{\rho_{\rm de}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$. Using dynamical system techniques developed in our companion paper on linear kernels, we derive new conditions that ensure positive and well-defined energy densities, as well as criteria to avoid future big rip singularities. We find that for $Q_{1}$, all densities remain positive, while for $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$ negative values of either DM or DE are unavoidable if energy flows from DM to DE. We also show that for $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ a big rip singularity always arises in the phantom regime $w<-1$, whereas for $Q_{3}$ this fate may be avoided if energy flows from DE to DM. In addition, we provide new exact analytical solutions for $\rho_{\rm dm}$ and $\rho_{\rm de}$ in the cases of $Q_{2}$ and $Q_{3}$, and obtain new expressions for the effective equations of state of DM, DE, the total fluid, and the reconstructed dynamical DE equation of state ($w_{\rm dm}^{\rm eff}$, $w_{\rm de}^{\rm eff}$, $w_{\rm tot}^{\rm eff}$, and $\tilde{w}$). Using these results, we discuss phantom crossings, evaluate how each kernel addresses the coincidence problem, and apply statefinder diagnostics to compare the models. These findings extend the theoretical understanding of non-linear IDE models and provide analytical tools for future observational constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 Interacting dark energy (IDE) models, in which dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) exchange energy through a non-gravitational interaction, have long been proposed as candidates to address key challenges in modern cosmology. These include the coincidence problem, the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, and, more recently, the hints of dynamical dark energy reported by the DESI collaboration. Given the renewed interest in IDE models, it is crucial to fully understand their parameter space when constraining them observationally, especially with regard to the often-neglected issues of negative energy densities and future big rip singularities. In this work, we present a comparative study of the general linear interaction $Q=3H(\delta_{\rm dm}\rho_{\rm dm} + \delta_{\rm de}\rho_{\rm de})$ and four special cases: $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}-\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm dm}$, and $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm de}$. For these five models, we perform a dynamical system analysis and derive new conditions that ensure positive, real, and well-defined energy densities throughout cosmic evolution, as well as criteria to avoid future big rip singularities. We obtain exact analytical solutions for $\rho_{\rm{dm}}$, $\rho_{\rm{de}}$, the effective equations of state ($w_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\rm{dm}}$, $w_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\rm{de}}$, $w_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\rm{tot}}$), and a reconstructed dynamical DE equation of state $\tilde{w}$. Using these results, we examine phantom crossings, address the coincidence problem, and apply the statefinder diagnostic to distinguish between models. We show that energy transfer from DM to DE inevitably produces negative energy densities and make future singularities more likely, while transfer from DE to DM avoids these pathologies and is thus theoretically favored.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an overview of the main results from our two companion papers that are relevant for observational constraints on interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We provide analytical solutions for the dark matter and dark energy densities, $\rho_{\rm dm}$ and $\rho_{\rm de}$, as well as the normalized Hubble function $h(z)$, for eight IDE models. These include five linear IDE models, namely $Q=3H(\delta_{\rm dm} \rho_{\rm dm} + \delta_{\rm de} \rho_{\rm de})$ and four special cases: $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta(\rho_{\rm dm}-\rho_{\rm de})$, $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm dm}$, and $Q=3H\delta \rho_{\rm de}$, together with three non-linear IDE models: $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm dm} \rho_{\rm de}}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$, $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm dm}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$, and $Q=3H\delta \left( \tfrac{\rho_{\rm de}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}} \right)$. For these eight models, we present conditions to avoid imaginary, undefined, and negative energy densities. In seven of the eight cases, negative densities arise if energy flows from DM to DE, implying a strong theoretical preference for energy transfer from DE to DM. We also provide conditions to avoid future big rip singularities and evaluate how each model addresses the coincidence problem in both the past and the future. Finally, we propose a set of approaches and simplifying assumptions that can be used when constraining IDE models, by defining regimes that restrict the parameter space according to the behavior researchers are willing to tolerate.

 - **Abstract**
 Turbulence in curved spacetimes in general, and in the vicinity of black holes (BHs) in particular, represents a poorly understood phenomenon that is often analysed employing techniques developed for flat spacetimes. We here propose a novel approach to study turbulence in strong gravitational fields that is based on the computation of structure functions on generic manifolds and is thus applicable to arbitrary curved spacetimes. In particular, we introduce, for the first time, a formalism to compute the characteristic properties of turbulence, such as the second-order structure function or the power spectral density, in terms of proper lengths and volumes and not in terms of coordinate lengths and volumes, as customarily done. By applying the new approach to the turbulent rest-mass density field from simulations of magnetised disc accretion onto a Kerr BH, we inspect in a rigorous way turbulence in regions close to the event horizon, but also in the disc, the wind, and in the jet. We demonstrate that the new approach can capture the typical behavior of an inertial-range cascade and that differences up to $40-80\%$ emerge in the vicinity of the event horizon with respect to the standard flat-spacetime approach. While these differences become smaller at larger distances, our study highlights that special care needs to be paid when analysing turbulence in strongly curved spacetimes.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel non-singular cosmological scenario within the framework of Horndeski gravity, consisting of three successive stages: (i) a Genesis phase, in which the Universe slowly expands from an asymptotically flat spacetime; (ii) a brief transition stage restoring General Relativity; and (iii) a Starobinsky inflationary phase. This construction is fully consistent within a viable parameter space: it remains weakly coupled, free from ghost and gradient instabilities, with luminal tensor and subluminal scalar perturbations throughout the entire evolution. Importantly, the Genesis phase induces characteristic corrections to the Starobinsky potential, which cannot be captured by simple $\sum_i c_i R^i$-type modifications. These corrections robustly enhance the scalar spectral index, thereby improving the agreement of Starobinsky inflation with recent CMB measurements, in particular the data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT).

 - **Abstract**
 A thermodynamic description of cosmological spacetimes may provide insights into the fundamentals of the cosmic evolution that remain otherwise obscure, in close analogy with 'black hole thermodynamics'. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of late-time cosmological evolution using the dynamical systems approach, focusing on the $\Lambda$CDM model and quintessence models with an exponential potential. Thermodynamic quantities obtained through the Hayward-Kodama formalism are mapped onto the phase space of these models, allowing us to investigate thermodynamic stability and phase transitions in a manner independent of the initial condition of the evolution of the universe. In both models, the universe inevitably undergoes a thermodynamic phase transition, marked by diverging specific heats, irrespective of its initial configuration. We further demonstrate that the thermodynamic stability can occur only during an accelerating phase of the universe. However, the necessary stability conditions are never satisfied anywhere in the phase space, rendering both models inherently thermodynamically unstable within the Hayward-Kodama framework. Importantly, our analysis highlights the dynamical system approach as a natural and powerful framework to probe the thermodynamic aspects of cosmological evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We study gravitational waves induced by scalar primordial fluctuations in Gleyzes-Langlois-Piazza-Vernizzi (GLPV), beyond Horndeski, scalar-tensor theories. We uncover, at the level of the action, a new scalar-scalar-tensor interaction, unique to GLPV models disconnected from Horndeski via disformal transformation. The new interaction leads to third derivatives in the source for scalar-induced tensor modes, which are absent in Horndeski-related theories. Such new higher-derivative terms lead to a further enhanced production of induced gravitational waves. We predict that for a scale-invariant primordial spectrum, the induced gravitational wave spectral density has a characteristic frequency dependence proportional to $f^5$. Such a fast-rising spectrum offers a potential unique signature of modified gravity in the early universe.

#### Overcharging Extremal Rotating Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we use the weak cosmic censorship conjecture(WCC) to constrain black hole solutions in modified gravity theories. While Wald showed that extremal Kerr-Newman black holes in general relativity cannot be overcharged by test charged particles, this protection may fail in theories beyond general relativity. We have considered generic rotating black hole solutions beyond the Kerr-Newman family and examine particle absorption processes that could lead to overcharging and the emergence of naked singularities. Identifying regions of parameter space where WCC is violated allows us to place direct, physically motivated bounds on deviations from general relativity.

#### Gaussian curvature and Lyapunov exponent as probes of black hole phase transitions

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05103

 - **Abstract**
 We study the Gaussian curvature of unstable null orbits. The Gaussian curvature exhibits multivaluedness near the phase transition point of a first-order phase transition. Numerical investigations of Reissner-Nordstrom Anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS), Hayward-AdS, and Hayward-Letelier-AdS black holes demonstrate that this geometric multivalued region coincides precisely with the spinodal region calculated by black hole thermodynamics. Using the known relation $K=-\lambda^2$ linking orbital geometry to chaotic dynamics, we show that this geometric feature also satisfies the critical exponents predicted by mean-field theory, consistent with those derived from Lyapunov exponents. Our work demonstrates that Gaussian curvature can serve as an alternative effective tool to study the phase structure of black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the stability of the Weyl geometry considering an exact black hole solution. By calculating the geodesics of massless and massive scalar fields orbiting outside the Weyl black hole background and using the Lyapunov exponent, we show that chaotic instabilities appear in the asymptotically de Siter-like spacetime. Calculating the photon sphere's quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a scalar field perturbing the Weyl black hole, we find a relation connecting the QNMs with the Lyapunov exponent in the asymptotically de Siter-like spacetime. Furthermore, we study the anomalous decay rate of the QNMs connecting their behavior with the Lyapunov exponent.

 - **Abstract**
 We release the first Numerical Relativity catalog of Institut de Ciencies del Cosmos at University of Barcelona (ICCUB) consisting of 128 simulations for black hole binaries. All simulations in this first release correspond to highly eccentric binaries with eccentricity $e = (0.62,0.79)$ which develop zoom-whirls up to three close passages before merger. We consider aligned, equal spin configurations in the range $\chi = (-0.5, 0.5)$ and equal mass ratios. For each simulation, we provide the modes $(\ell, m)$ of Weyl scalar $\psi_4^{(\ell,m)}$ extrapolated to $r = \infty$, with $\ell \leq 4$. In addition, we provide the corresponding strain modes obtained by computing a double time integral of the Weyl scalar modes. Moreover, we provide metadata and the parameter files required to reproduce our results using the open-source code Einstein Toolkit. A Python code that facilitates the access to the data is available on Git-Hub.
