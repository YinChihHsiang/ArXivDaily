 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive exploration of hierarchical triple black hole (BH) systems to address the "initial separation" problem in gravitational wave astrophysics. This problem arises because isolated BH binaries must have extremely small initial separations to merge within a Hubble time via gravitational wave (GW) emission alone, separations at which their stellar progenitors would have merged prematurely. Using a modified JADE secular code incorporating GW energy loss, we systematically investigate a seven-dimensional parameter space: masses of three BHs (5-100 $M_\odot$ inner binary, 1-200 $M_\odot$ tertiary), inner/outer semimajor axes (1-200 AU and 100-10,000 AU), outer orbit eccentricity (0-0.9), and mutual inclination (40°-80°). We employed an adaptive MCMC approach sampling the merger/nonmerger transition boundary across nearly 15 million simulations. Results reveal merger-conducive regions correspond to asymmetric inner binary masses, large inner separations where von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) mechanism operates effectively without relativistic precession suppression, small outer separations providing stronger perturbations, and large outer eccentricities bringing the tertiary closer at pericenter. Merger probability correlates positively with mutual inclination. We developed a classification scheme for nonmerging systems based on GW emission and ZLK oscillations. A trained neural network predicts merger outcomes with 99% ROC score and 95% accuracy (99.7% for high-confidence predictions), enabling rapid population synthesis. Validation against N-body integrations showed 87% qualitative agreement, confirming our methodology captures essential triple BH dynamics while enabling unprecedented-scale exploration of configurations resolving the initial separation problem.

 - **Abstract**
 The LISA datastream will be populated by large instrumental and astrophysical noises, both potentially exhibiting long-term non-stationarities. Modelling and inferring on them is a challenging task, central for accurate signal reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{bahamas}$, a codebase designed to characterize noises and stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) in LISA. $\texttt{bahamas}$ adopts a time-frequency data representation, based on the Short Time Fourier Transform, to accurately describe the signal temporal evolution and accommodate for the presence of data gaps. In addition, $\texttt{bahamas}$ supports a variety of SGWB spectral models proposed in literature, enabling joint inference on them. Posterior sampling leverages No-U-Turn sampling an efficient variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, inheriting the cross-hardware capabilities provided by NumPyro (CPU/GPU/TPU). We benchmark $\texttt{bahamas}$ performances on a simple test case, and present ongoing developments to appear in future releases.

 - **Abstract**
 The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to detect thousands of individually resolved gravitational wave sources, overlapping in time and frequency, on top of unresolved astrophysical and/or primordial backgrounds. Disentangling resolved sources from backgrounds and extracting their parameters in a computationally intensive "global fit" is normally regarded as a necessary step toward reconstructing the properties of the underlying astrophysical populations. Here, we show that it is possible to infer the properties of the most numerous population of LISA sources - Galactic double white dwarfs - directly from the frequency (or, equivalently, time) strain series, by using a simulation-based approach that bypasses the global fit entirely. By training a normalizing flow on a custom-designed compression of simulated LISA frequency series from the Galactic double white dwarf population, we demonstrate how to infer the posterior distribution of population parameters (e.g., mass function, frequency, and spatial distributions). This allows for extracting information on the population parameters from both resolved and unresolved sources simultaneously and in a computationally efficient manner. Our approach to target population properties directly can be readily extended to other source classes (e.g., massive and stellar-mass black holes, extreme mass ratio inspirals), provided fast simulations are available, and to scenarios involving non-Gaussian or non-stationary noise (e.g., data gaps).

 - **Abstract**
 Microquasars, compact binary systems with an accreting stellar-mass black hole or neutron star, are promising candidates for high-energy particle acceleration. Recently, the LHAASO collaboration reported on the detection of $>100$ TeV $\gamma$-ray emission from five microquasars, suggesting that these sources are efficient particle accelerators. In microquasars, high-energy $\gamma$-rays can be produced in large-scale jets or winds. In this work, we explore the X-ray, $\gamma$-ray and neutrino emission from SS 433, V4641 Sgr and GRS 1905+105. We consider leptonic and hadronic scenarios to explain the spectra observed by LHAASO and other high-energy $\gamma$-ray detectors. We estimate the neutrino flux associated with the hadronic component and investigate the detectability of neutrinos from these sources in current and future neutrino telescopes. We find that among the three sources, V4641 Sgr has the best prospects of observation with a combined next-generation neutrino telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 The distance duality relation (DDR) between luminosity and angular diameter distances holds if gravity is described by a metric theory and the universe is transparent. Recent cosmological inferences using Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations have suggested that dark energy may evolve in time. We test how the assumption of distance duality impacts dark energy inference. Marginalizing over the absolute SNe~Ia luminosity, we find no deviation from the DDR, independent of the SN~Ia compilation used, or the assumed dark energy model. This corresponds a maximum deviation in the SN~Ia luminosity of $\Delta m \sim 0.05$ mag at the highest redshift. Allowing for deviations in the DDR increases the errors in the dark energy equation of state parameters (EoS) by 30-50$\%$. For the Pantheon+ compilation the constraints on dark energy are within $2\sigma$ of $\Lambda$CDM when applying a more realistic minimum redshift cut $z_{\rm min} >0.023$. We constrain possible physical scenarios that can impact cosmic transparency, specifically photon-axion mixing and the presence of (gray) intergalactic (IG) dust, in the latter case limiting the dust density to $\Omega_{\rm dust}<2 \times 10^{-4}$ at 95\% C.L. When using the local Cepheid calibration of the SNe~Ia absolute luminosity, a significant deviation from the DDR relation (for which $\epsilon=0$) is preferred. However, the best fit parameter value $\epsilon = -0.091 \pm 0.024$ requires the SNe~Ia to be brighter than the case with DDR valid, therefore, neither of the physical scenarios which dim the SNe can explain the high $H_0$. Constraints on the photon-axion interaction length scale suggest a limit on the coupling constant of $g_{a\gamma} < 10^{-12}\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We predict the spectrum and composition of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UCRs for short) generated in a binary neutron star merger, exploiting the highly constrained initial conditions to make quantitative predictions for the cutoff energy for various nuclei. The key mechanism producing UCRs heavier than helium is acceleration in the magnetized turbulent outflow outside the jets. We find the rigidity cutoff of this component is $\mathcal{R}_{\rm cut} \equiv E_{\rm cut}/eZ \approx 6-9$ EV, consistent with the measured value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm cut} = 6.8^{+5.8}_{-2.8}\,$EV from fitting data. This agreement strengthens the case that BNS mergers are the main site of UCR production. The jets may also be capable of accelerating particles to ultrahigh energy: these UCRs would be protons and/or helium, in a ratio that depends on the neutron star equation of state. We estimate the cutoff energies of such a component to be $E_{\rm cut}\approx\! 10\,$EeV for p and $\approx\! 30\,$EeV for He. Such a jet component may explain the hint of a secondary light population at higher energy found in the analysis of Muzio et al. (2019). With more precise data, the locus of production of helium and intermediate mass nuclei can be inferred from their rigidity structure, and the predicted small deviations from a pure Peters Cycle can be checked. Predicting the relative abundances of different elements and the total energy in UCRs per merger event is feasible, but beyond the scope of this paper. This scenario predicts that each neutrino above 1 PEV is co-directional with a gravitational wave arriving ~1 day earlier, and that the highest energy UCRs have masses heavier than iron.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave (GW) neutron star mergers with an associated electromagnetic counterpart constitute powerful probes of binary evolution, the production sites of heavy elements, general relativity, and the expansion of the universe. Only a handful of candidate GW binary mergers during the fourth LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observing run (O4) so far are believed to include a neutron star. We present optical-near infrared follow-up observations of the candidate neutron-star black hole GW merger S250206dm. This is the first high-significance mass gap neutron star-black hole candidate observed by multiple GW detectors (thus having a significantly smaller sky localization than one-detector events), offering the first opportunity to effectively follow up a GW event of this kind. Our GW MultiMessenger Astronomy DECam Survey (GW-MMADS) campaign consisted of a wide-field search using the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and T80-South (T80S), as well as galaxy-targeted observations using the Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) imager and the Wendelstein 2.1m 3-channel camera. No viable kilonova counterpart was found in our observations. We use our observation depths to place competitive constraints on kilonova models similar to or brighter than the GW170817 kilonova AT 2017gfo within our observed fields, ruling out 100\% of such models with SOAR galaxy-targeted observations and $\sim43$\% (48\%) with DECam (DECam and T80S).

 - **Abstract**
 Studying compact-object binary mergers in star clusters is crucial for understanding stellar evolution and dynamical interactions in galaxies. Open clusters in particular are more abundant over cosmic time than globular clusters, however, previous research on low-mass clusters with $\lesssim 10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ has focused on binary black holes (BBHs) or black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) binaries. Binary mergers of other compact objects, such as white dwarfs (WDs), are also crucial as progenitors of transient phenomena such as Type Ia supernovae and Fast Radio Bursts. We present simulations of three types of open clusters with masses of $10^2$, $10^3$, and $10^4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. In massive clusters with $\gtrsim 10^4~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$, BBHs are dynamically formed, however, less massive compact binaries such as WD-WD and WD-NS are perturbed inside the star clusters, causing them to evolve into other objects. We further find BH-NS mergers only in $10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters. Considering star clusters with a typical open cluster mass, we observe that WD-WD merger rates slightly increase for $10^3~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters but decrease for $10^2~\textrm{M}_{\odot}$ clusters. Since the host clusters are tidally disrupted, most of them merge outside of the clusters. Our WD-WD merger results have further implications for two classes of transients. Super-Chandrasekhar WD-WD mergers are present in our simulations, demonstrating potential sources of Fast Radio Bursts at a rate of 70-780 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, higher than the rate estimated for globular clusters. Additionally, we find that Carbon-Oxygen WD-WD mergers in our open clusters (34-640 $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$) only account for 0.14-2.6% of the observed Type Ia supernova rate in our local Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new, state-of-the-art computation of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB), where we use neutrino spectra from multi-dimensional, multi-second core collapse supernova simulations - including both neutron-star and black-hole forming collapses - and binary evolution effects from modern population synthesis codes. Large sets of numerical results are processed and connected in a consistent manner, using two key quantities: the mass of the star's Carbon-Oxygen (CO) core at an advanced pre-collapse stage - which depends on binary evolution effects - and the compactness parameter, which is the main descriptor of the post-collapse neutrino emission. The method enables us to model the neutrino emission of a very diverse, binary-affected population of stars, which cannot unambiguously be mapped in detail by existing core collapse simulations. We find that including black hole-forming collapses enhances the DSNB by up to 50% at energies greater than 30-40 MeV. Binary evolution effects can change the total rate of collapses and generate a sub-population of high core mass stars that are stronger neutrino emitters. However, the net effect on the DSNB is moderate - up to a 15% increase in flux - due to the rarity of these super-massive cores and to the relatively modest dependence of the neutrino emission on the CO core mass. The methodology presented here is suitable for extensions and generalizations, and therefore it lays the foundation for modern treatments of the DSNB.

 - **Abstract**
 We apply a halo velocity bias model, $\gamma_{f}$, within the Aemulus simulation suite for General Relativity (GR) to investigate its efficacy in identifying the signature of assembly bias and Modified Gravity (MG). In the investigation of assembly bias, utilizing galaxy clustering data ranging from scales of $0.1 - 60 \text{Mpc}\,h^{-1}$, we discover that our emulator model accurately recreates the cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, along with the velocity bias $\gamma_{f}$, staying well within the 1-$\sigma$ error margins, provided that assembly bias is considered. Ignoring assembly bias can considerably alter our model constraints on parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ if the test sample includes assembly bias. Using our emulator for MG simulations, which encompasses two Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati models (DGP; N1, N5) and two $f(R)$ models (F4, F6), we can effectively identify a robust signature of modified gravity, for models such as DGP-N1 and $f(R)$-F4, as indicated by a noticeable deviation of $\gamma_{f}$ from unity. Using the velocity dispersion of dark matter halos to effectively represent the underlying strength of the velocity field of these MG simulations, we find that the simple $\gamma_{f}$ model can recover the truth with minimal bias. These evaluations indicate that our simple halo-velocity bias model is capable of detecting significant MG characteristics, although additional methodologies should be pursued to improve model constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study aimed at quantifying the detectability of radio counterparts of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers with total masses $\lesssim 3$\,M$_{\odot}$, which may form neutron star (NS) remnants. We focus on mergers localized by gravitational-wave (GW) observations to sky areas $\lesssim 10$\,deg$^2$, a precision that greatly facilitates optical counterpart identification and enables radio discovery even without detections at other wavelengths. Widely separated GW detectors are essential for building samples of well-localized BNS mergers accessible to US-based radio telescopes, with minimum yearly detection rates (assuming the smallest values of the BNS local merger rate) ranging from a few with current GW detectors to hundreds with next-generation GW instruments. Current GW networks limit well-localized detections to $z\lesssim 0.2$, while next-generation GW detectors extend the reach to $z\lesssim 0.8$, encompassing the median redshift of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). With next-generation radio arrays operating at a several tens of GHz and providing an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to the most sensitive ones available today, short GRB-like jet afterglows can be detected for a large fraction of the considered BNS mergers. At lower radio frequencies, detections with current radio interferometric arrays are feasible, though subject to synchrotron self-absorption effects. The enhanced sensitivity and survey speed of future radio interferometers operating at a few GHz, combined with the higher detection rate of well-localized BNSs enabled by next-generation GW observatories, are key to probing disk-wind and dynamical ejecta afterglows, as well as remnant diversity.
#### The effectively optically thin accretion flow and its implication in supermassive black holes

 - **Abstract**
 Based on a unified description of various accretion flows, we find a long-ignored solution - the effectively optically thin accretion flow, occurring at accretion rates around Eddington value. As a consequence of radiation-pressure dominance, the density in a standard thin disc (SSD) decreases with the increase of accretion rates, making the innermost region effectively optically thin. Further increase in accretion rate leads to a rise of the temperature so that the Compton cooling is able to balance the accretion released energy. We demonstrate that the effectively optically thin flow is characterized by moderate temperature and large scattering optical depth, producing a multi-color Wien spectrum. For an appropriate accretion rate, the accretion flow transforms from an outer SSD to an inner effectively optically thin flow. Thus, the spectra of the whole accretion flow exhibit two components, i.e., a multi-color Wien spectrum at higher frequency and a multi-color blackbody, the former could provide an alternative origin of soft X-ray excess or formation of warm corona in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our stability analysis proves it is thermally stable and viscously unstable, indicating its existence in accreting systems. We show that effectively optically thin accretion flow exists in supermassive black holes for accretion rates around 0.1 to 10 times Eddington value, bridging the SSD at low accretion rates and slim disc at high rates. By comparing the predictions and average spectra of AGN, we constrain the viscosity parameter to be $\alpha \sim 0.03$, in good agreement with that derived from observed variability.
#### Braking index of the frequently glitching PSR J0537$-$6910

 - **Abstract**
 PSR J0537$-$6910 is the most frequently glitching pulsar, exhibiting large glitches at a rate of roughly thrice per year. It displays a negative long-term effective braking index $n' = -1.234(9)$ and roughly constant positive frequency second derivatives extending all the way from one glitch to the next. We use the published RXTE and NICER timing data (i) to explore whether `persistent shifts' (non-relaxing parts of the glitch $\Delta\dot{\nu}$ in the spin-down rate, like those observed in the Crab pulsar) can explain the negative effective braking index; (ii) to ascribe part of the inter-glitch relaxation at constant frequency second derivative $\ddot{\nu}$ to internal torques due to the coupling between the observed surface and the interior of the neutron star like deduced for the Vela pulsar; (iii) to demonstrate, as a proof of concept, that after taking account of the persistent shifts and internal torques, the true braking index $n$ associated with the pulsar braking torque is $n\sim 3 $, and (iv) to explore various empirical or model dependent correlations between glitch parameters and the time to the next glitch. The average persistent shift derived for PSR J0537$-$6910 is in agreement with the persistent shift values for the Crab pulsar. By applying the crustquake model, we infer a broken plate size of $D=80$ m, similar to the value obtained for the minimum glitch size observed in the Crab pulsar. The inter-glitch $\ddot{\nu}$ values inferred for the internal torques are commensurate with those in the Vela pulsar. Delineating the effects of persistent shifts and inter-glitch relaxation due to internal torques as observed in the Crab, Vela and other pulsars, we obtained a true braking index value $n=2.75(47)$ for PSR J0537$-$6910, similar to braking indices observed from other young pulsars. PSR J0537$-$6910 is not a likely source of gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we employ two model-independent approaches, including redshift binning method and polynomial interpolation method, to reconstruct dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) $w(z)$ and DE density function $f(z)$. Our analysis incorporates data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release 2, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors from Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope data release 6, and three Type Ia supernovae (SN) compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5). To ensure model independence, we adopt three redshift binning schemes (n=3, 4, 5) and three polynomial interpolation schemes with the same number of nodes (n=3, 4, 5). Our main conclusions are as follows: 1) After taking into account DESI data, there is a clear trend that DE should evolve with redshift (with deviations from the cosmological constant reaching at least a $2.13\sigma$ confidence level), indicating that current observations favor a dynamical DE. 2) In the redshift range $0.5 < z < 1.5$, the DE EoS w(z) exhibits a decreasing trend and crosses the phantom divide $w=-1$, suggesting quintom-like behavior. 3) The DE density f(z) first increases at low redshift, reaching a hump around $z\approx 0.5$, and then decreases at $0.5 < z < 1.5$, with a rapid decrease at $z>1.0$. 4) For $z > 1.5$, current data are insufficient to place strong constraints on the evolution of DE, resulting in large uncertainties in the DE reconstruction. It must be emphasized that, these four main conclusions are independent of specific reconstruction models, and are insensitive to the choice of SN compilations.

 - **Abstract**
 The transient Galactic source MAXI J1744-294 went into an outburst in 2025 for the very first time. We study the spectral properties of this source during this outburst using archival data from the XRISM satellite for both of its Resolve and Xtend instruments. We have analyzed the source during one epoch, on March 03, 2025, or MJD 60737, on which XRISM data were available. Using both phenomenological and physical model fitting approaches for continuum emissions, along with line emission and interstellar absorption models, we analyzed the spectral data in the broad 2-10 keV energy band. From our spectral analysis, we have found the existence of multiple iron lines, which are different components of the Fe XXV emission. These line complexes arise from two highly ionized plasmas with ionization rate ~ 10000 erg cm/s with distinct turbulent velocities: one broad (vturb ~ 2513 km/s) from hot gas at the inner accretion disk, and one narrow (vturb ~ 153 km/s ) scattered by nearby photoionized gas. The source is a moderately spinning black hole with a spin of 0.63-0.70, a mass of 5.7-10.1 Solar masses, and a disk inclination angle of 19-24 degrees. The spectral model fitted parameters suggest that the source is in the soft spectral state. The source is situated in a crowded field near the Galactic center, resulting in a very high hydrogen column density.
#### Resolving the negative neutrino mass with cosmic birefringence

 - **Abstract**
 The recent measurement of baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) reveals a mild tension with observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) within the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. This discrepancy leads to a preference for a total neutrino mass that is lower than the minimum value inferred from neutrino oscillation experiments. Alternatively, this tension can be eased within $\Lambda$CDM by assuming a higher optical depth ($\tau \simeq 0.09$), but such a value conflicts with large-scale CMB polarization data. We point out that cosmic birefringence, as suggested by recent Planck reanalyses, resolves this discrepancy if the birefringence angle varies significantly during reionization. Specifically, we consider the fact that the measured cosmic birefringence angle $\beta_0=0.34\pm0.09\,(1\,\sigma)\,$deg has the phase ambiguity, i.e., the measured rotation angle is described by $\beta=\beta_0+180n\,$deg ($n\in \mathbb{Z}$). We show that cosmic birefringence induced by axion-like particles with nonzero $n$ suppresses the reionization bump, allowing a higher $\tau$ consistent with data. We provide a viable parameter space where the birefringence effect simultaneously accounts for the low-$\ell$ polarization spectra, the Planck $EB$ correlations, and the elevated value of $\tau$, suggesting a key role for cosmic birefringence in current cosmological tensions.

 The recent detection of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A ($\sim$220 PeV) by KM3NeT telescope poses a challenge to conventional astrophysical models, particularly in light of the absence of similar $\gtrsim$100 PeV events in IceCube data, despite its larger exposure. We propose a novel mechanism in which binary black hole mergers act as transient neutrino sources via gravitationally induced electroweak vacuum instability. In this scenario, the extreme spacetime curvature near the horizons during the final inspiral phase destabilizes the Higgs vacuum, triggering nucleation of true-vacuum bubbles. Collisions between these bubbles produce microscopic black holes that rapidly evaporate via Hawking radiation, emitting intense, short-lived bursts of neutrinos with energies exceeding 100 PeV. The resulting neutrino fluence follows a heavy-tailed distribution, allowing rare but highly luminous sources to account for events like KM3-230213A while remaining consistent with IceCube's non-detections. This framework links gravitational wave sources to ultra-high-energy neutrino production and suggests that future multi-messenger observations may detect electromagnetic signatures from microscopic black hole evaporation.

 Context: A large number of isolated black holes (IBHs) are expected to populate the Galaxy. However, only one has been confirmed by the analysis of a microlensing event, and no confirmed emission detection from an IBH has been reported so far. Aims: We analysed the detectability of electromagnetic signatures from IBHs moving in the Galaxy. Methods: We considered accretion from the interstellar medium onto an IBH and assumed the formation of an outflow. We modelled the accretion process and the interaction of the outflow with the surrounding medium on large scales, including mechanical feedback on the accretion process. Furthermore, we also calculated the emission from three different regions: the accretion region, the radiation from the outflow medium interaction structure, and the emission of relativistic particles that diffuse in the surrounding medium. Results: Multiwavelength emission associated with Galactic IBHs can be detected in systems moving through a very dense medium. Thermal emission from accretion could be observed in the mid infrared and in hard X rays with current and forthcoming observatories. Thermal and non thermal emission from the outflow medium shock could also be detected in the radio and millimetre ranges. Moreover, detection of the emission from particles diffusing in a dense medium could be feasible in gamma rays. Applying our model to the IBH associated with the gravitational microlensing event MOA2011BLG191 OGLE2011BLG0462, we inferred that radio and infrared detection of the IBH is plausible. Also, we derived that IBHs could be modest Galactic cosmic ray contributors, potentially reaching a 1% contribution at 1 PeV. Finally, by extending our model to primordial black holes, we conclude that efficient leptonic acceleration in their outflow medium interactions would rule them out as a major dark matter component.

 - **Abstract**
 Space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as LISA, are expected to detect thousands of Galactic close white dwarf binaries emitting nearly monochromatic GWs. In this study, we demonstrate that LISA is reasonably likely to detect higher harmonic GW signals, particularly the $(l, |m|) = (3, 3)$ mode, from a limited sample of nearby close white dwarf binaries, even with small orbital velocities $v/c$ of order $10^{-3}$. The amplitudes of these post-Newtonian modes provide robust probes of mass asymmetry in such systems, making them valuable observational targets, especially in mass-transferring binaries. Long-term, coordinated detector operations will further improve the prospects for detecting these informative signals.

 In this proceedings, we review the importance and complexity of detecting and characterizing supermassive binary black holes using conventional techniques (spectroscopy, timing, imaging). We show how spectropolarimetric data can strengthen or discard binary black hole candidates on solid grounds, and present what kind of instrument could perform this task. Namely, a high spectral resolution polarimeter operating from the far-ultraviolet (FUV) to the near-infrared (NIR), such as the POLLUX prototype, would perfectly fit within the payload of the Habitable Worlds Observatory and help revolutionize the study of extragalactic objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of statistical inhomogeneity and anisotropy in primordial scalar perturbations on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). Assuming inflationary quantum fluctuations originate from a coherent state, the resulting primordial scalar perturbations acquire a non-zero space-dependent mean, violating statistical homogeneity, statistical isotropy, and parity. As a consequence of statistical inhomogeneities, SIGW acquires distinct scale-dependent features in its correlation function. Statistical anisotropies further lead to possible parity violation and correlation between different polarization modes in the tensor perturbations. Therefore, detection of these signatures in the stochastic gravitational wave background would offer probes to the statistical nature of primordial scalar perturbations beyond the scales accessible to CMB observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive thermodynamic derivation and observational validation of the third-order galaxy correlation function, extending the seminal work of Iqbal et al [ 1, 2]. Using the statistical mechanics framework for gravitating systems, we derive the governing partial differential equation and provide explicit analytical solutions. Our enhanced framework includes: (1) comparison with N-body simulations and SDSS/BOSS galaxy survey data showing excellent agreement (\c{hi}2/dof = 1.27), (2) systematic methodology for determining model parameters from observational constraints, (3) detailed analysis of scale-dependent behaviour across linear and nonlinear regimes, (4) direct connections to standard cosmological parameters ({\sigma}8, {\Omega}m, fN L), (5) comprehensive treatment of redshift-space distortions, and (6) analysis of observational systematics. We demonstrate that our third-order correlation parameter b3 provides independent constraints complementary to two-point analyses, with potential to break degeneracies in dark energy and modified gravity studies. Explicit quantitative limitations regarding cosmic expansion effects and equilibrium assumptions are provided, along with comparisons to alternative methodologies and extensions for next-generation surveys.
#### Constraining the Origin of FRB 20121102A's Persistent Radio Source with Long-Term Radio Observations

 - **Abstract**
 The persistent radio source (PRS) associated with FRB 20121102A, the first precisely localized repeating fast radio burst (FRB), provides key constraints on both its local environment and the nature of the underlying FRB engine. We present a seven-year (2016-2023) temporal analysis of the PRS, combining new uGMRT observations with archival data across L-band frequencies. We find no statistically significant long-term trend in its L-band flux density. The observed variability is consistent with refractive interstellar scintillation, and the data do not require the PRS to be a source exhibiting strong intrinsic variability. This stability challenges models predicting rapid fading from evolving magnetized outflows, such as those powered by young magnetars or relativistic shocks. Our low-frequency observations show no evidence for spectral evolution between 1.4 GHz and 745 MHz, with a measured spectral index of $\alpha = -0.15 \pm 0.08$, in agreement with values reported from earlier observations in 2016-2017. The PRS remains compact, exhibits a flat radio spectrum, and-if powered by an intermediate-mass black hole accreting at a low Eddington ratio-its radio and X-ray properties are broadly consistent with the fundamental plane of radio-loud AGNs. While not conclusive, this scenario represents a viable alternative to magnetar wind nebula models and warrants further investigation. Furthermore, we find no statistically significant correlation between FRB burst activity and the luminosity of associated PRSs among repeating sources. This apparent decoupling challenges simple progenitor models that directly link bursts and persistent emission. Together, these results suggest that the FRB engine and PRS may in some systems originate from physically distinct sources, underscoring the need for flexible models to explain the diverse environments of repeating FRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be powered by accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole. A fundamental ingredient in shaping our understanding of AGN is their variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Variability studies have the potential to help us understand the geometry of the emitting regions (in various energy bands), their causal relations, and the physics of the accretion processes. This review focuses on the observational properties of AGN variability in the optical/UV/X-ray bands (where most of the AGN luminosity is emitted) and their dependence on the AGN physical parameters (i.e. mass, luminosity, accretion rate). We also discuss possible interpretations in the context of accreting compact systems, and we review the use of variability as a tool to discover AGN and trace their properties across cosmic time, using both ground and space facilities. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges provided by current and next-generation optical/X-ray surveys, to use variability as an effective tool to probe the growth of super massive black holes in the Universe.
#### Sagittarius A* near-infrared flares polarization as a probe of space-time I: Non-rotating exotic compact objects

 - **Abstract**
 The center of our galaxy hosts Sagittarius~A*, a supermassive compact object of $\sim 4.3\times 10^6$ solar masses, usually associated with a black hole. Nevertheless, black holes possess a central singularity, considered unphysical, and an event horizon, which leads to loss of unitarity in a quantum description of the system. To address these theoretical inconsistencies, alternative models, collectively known as exotic compact objects, have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the potential detectability of signatures associated with non-rotating exotic compact objects within the Sgr~A* polarized flares dataset, as observed through GRAVITY and future instruments. We examine a total of eight distinct metrics, originating from four different categories of static and spherically symmetric compact objects: Black Holes, Boson stars, Fluid spheres, and Gravastars. Our approach involves utilizing a toy model that orbits the compact object in the equatorial plane, at the Schwarzschild-Keplerian velocity. Using simulated astrometric and polarimetric data with present GRAVITY and future GRAVITY+ uncertainties, we fit the datasets across all metrics examined. We evaluated the detectability of the metric for each dataset based on the resulting $\chi^2_\mathrm{red}$ and BIC-based Bayes factors. Plunge-through images of ECOs affect polarization and astrometry. With GRAVITY's present uncertainties, only a compact boson-star model is discernible. GRAVITY+'s improved sensitivity allows detection of most exotic compact object models. However, enhancing the astrophysical complexity of the hot spot model diminishes these outcomes. Presently, GRAVITY's uncertainties limit us to detecting just one exotic compact object metric. With GRAVITY+'s enhanced sensitivity, we can expect to uncover additional exotic compact object models and use Sgr~A* as a laboratory for fundamental physics.

 - **Abstract**
 Precise measurement of the Hubble parameter will enable stringent tests of the standard model for cosmology. Standard sirens, using the luminosity distances measured by gravitational-wave observations of compact binary mergers, are expected to provide such measurements independently in the next decade. With the ground- and space-based gravitational wave observatories, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), different types of standard sirens altogether will place constraints across a wide redshift range. In this paper, we forecast the precisions of standard siren Hubble parameter measurements and compare various scenarios, accounting for the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty. Specifically, we find a $2\%$ constraint on $H_0$, a $1.5-3\%$ constraint on $H(z)$ at $z=1$, and a $3-5\%$ constraint on $H(z)$ at $z=7$ when combining LVK and LISA standard sirens with precise redshift measurements from electromagnetic counterpart observations. We do not find a significant improvement when including standard sirens with no EM counterpart, but which rely on features in the black hole mass distribution, and the potential systematics introduced by the possible redshift evolution of such features could further degrade the measurement accuracy if not properly accounted for.

 - **Abstract**
 In this letter, we report a new phenomena of recurring regions when relating observables for hybrid neutron stars and hybrid neutron-star mergers. To describe dense matter within hybrid stars, we introduce a percolation to vary the size and characteristics of the deconfinement phase transition to quark matter. Before and after the percolation, we keep the hadronic and quark phases the same, described by different realistic models for the equation of state of beta-equilibrated, charge-neutral, zero-temperature matter. When solving spherical and deformed equations for neutron stars in general relativity, we find that: no matter the size or characteristics of the percolation region, or the order of the phase transition on either side (hadronic and quark), as long as we minimize the average sound speed from the beginning of the percolation region to the central density for a given star, we can produce equations of state that cross through the same, small recurring region within mass-radius and mass-tidal deformability diagrams. Our findings provide a new way to produce hybrid equations of state for dense matter that match a given observation of neutron stars or neutron star mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 We use [CII] observations of a large QSO sample to segregate sources by host galaxy mass, aiming to identify those in the most massive hosts. [CII] luminosity, a known tracer of molecular gas, is taken as a proxy for host mass and used to rank 190 QSOs at z>5.9, spanning a 6-mag UV luminosity range (-22<Muv<-28). Particularly valuable are ALMA data from a cycle-10 CISTERN program, providing [CII] coverage for 46 UV-faint (M_{UV,AB}>-24.5) and 25 especially UV-faint (Muv>-23.5) QSOs, improving statistics by 5x and 6x, respectively. Taking massive host galaxies to be those where L[CII]>1.8x10^9 Lsol (median L[CII] of UV-bright QSOs), we identify 61 QSOs, including 13 which are UV-faint and 7 especially UV-faint. Using these selections and recent QSO luminosity functions (LFs), we present the first characterization of UV luminosity distribution for QSOs in massive host galaxies and quantify [CII] LFs for both UV-bright and UV-faint QSOs. While ~3% of massive-host QSOs are UV-bright (Muv<-26), >~85% are UV-faint (Muv>-24.5). This wide dispersion in UV luminosities reflects variations in dust obscuration, accretion efficiency, and black hole mass. Though spectroscopy is needed for definitive conclusions, black hole mass appears to be the dominant factor driving variations in the UV luminosity, based on 34 [CII]-luminous (L[CII]>1.8x10^9 Lsol) QSOs distributed across a ~3-mag baseline in UV luminosity and with measured MBH. At Muv~-23, the median extrapolated log10 (MBH/Msol) is 8.1+/-0.4, consistent with the local relation. SMBHs in UV-bright QSOs thus appear to be ~15(-9)(+25)x more massive than typical for massive host galaxies at z~6.

 We present a canonical quantization framework for static spherically symmetric spacetimes described by the Einstein-Hilbert action with a cosmological constant. In addition to recovering the classical Schwarzschild-(Anti)-de Sitter solutions via the Ehrenfest theorem, we investigate the quantum uncertainty relations that arise among the geometric operators in this setup. Our analysis uncovers an intriguing relation to black hole thermodynamics and opens a new angle towards generalized uncertainty relations. We further obtain an upper and a lower limit of the mass that is allowed in our model, for a given value of the cosmological constant. Both limits, when evaluated for the known value of the cosmological constant, have a stunning relation to observed bounds. These findings open a promising avenue for deeper insights into how quantum effects manifest in spacetime geometry and gravitational systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate observational constraints on cubic curvature corrections to general relativity by analyzing quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in accreting black hole systems. In particular, we study Kerr black hole solution corrected by cubic curvature terms parameterized by $\beta_5$ and $\beta_6$. While $\beta_6$ corresponds to a field-redefinition invariant structure, the $\beta_5$ term can in principle be removed via a field redefinition. Nonetheless, since we work in the frame where the accreting matter minimally couples to the metric, $\beta_5$ is in general present. Utilizing the corrected metric, we compute the QPO frequencies within the relativistic precession framework. Using observational data from GRO J1655$-$40 and a Bayesian analysis, we constrain the coupling parameters to $|\beta_5| < (27.73\,\mathrm{km})^4$ and $|\beta_6| < (15.34\,\mathrm{km})^4$. These bounds improve upon existing constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis and the speed of gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the shadow and thin accretion disk around Ayón-Beato-García (ABG) black hole (BH) coupled with a cloud of strings (CS), characterized by the nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) parameter $g$, and the CS parameter $a$. By comparing shadow diameters with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of M87$^{*}$ and Sgr A$^*$, we have established constraints on the BH parameters $g$ and $a$. Additionally, we analyze the BH shadow, lensing ring, and photon ring features for the ABG BH coupled with CS. Our results indicate that the shadow radius increases monotonically with the CS parameter $a$, while it decreases with increasing $g$. Finally, the study explores the physical properties and observational signatures of thin accretion disks around ABG BH with CS. The results show that an increase in parameter $g$ leads to a hotter and more luminous disk, while an increase in parameter $a$ results in a cooler and less luminous disk.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic censorship conjecture takes a pivotal status in general relativity. We demonstrate that quantum effects, Hawking effect together with Shwinger effect inevitably lead to violation of cosmic censorship. We find that naked singularity spontaneously appears in late time evolution of an isolated large dilatonic black hole. The critical discovery is that the power of Hawking radiation converges to a finite value for an extreme dilatonic black hole, which directly exposes the singularity in finite time. The spectrum of Hawking radiation of extreme dilatonic black holes becomes a truncated shrink Planck distribution. We analyze the underlying physics of the spectrum of Hawking radiation, which roots in extraordinarily wide potential around the horizon. We study the discharge mechanism of a dilatonic black hole through Schwinger effect. Amazingly, the Schwinger pair production naturally ceases for an extreme dilatonic black hole with mass larger than $1.7\times 10^5$ solar masses. Furthermore, we show that evaporation of charged particle because of the Schwinger effect do not save the cosmic censorship for black holes heavier than $1.784\times 10^7 $ solar masses in a significant region of initial charge parameter space. For the first time, we demonstrate that the naked singularities are {\rm spontaneously} formed driven by quantum effects, such that we learn quantum gravity directly from the information shedded from the singularity.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we systematically investigate the optical appearance of a Schwarzschild black hole illuminated by three geometrically thin accretion disk models under varying observational inclination angles. Based on the geometric relationship between the black hole and observer, we first divide the accretion disk into co-side and counter-side semi-disks. Subsequently, we analyze their differences in photon orbit distributions, transfer functions, and received intensities. Our results reveal distinct inclination-dependent behaviors between the two semi-disks: when the inclination approaches $\pi/2$, the co-side semi-disk develops richer ring structures with the lensed emission dominating the total brightness. Furthermore, through explicit specification of the emission profiles of the three models, we present optical images for both optically thin and thick disk scenarios at different inclinations. The results demonstrate that: (i) the bright rings in all three models become progressively compressed and deviate from circularity as inclination increases; (ii) for thick disks, partial rings are obscured and the overall intensity is lower than thin disks. These results may advance our understanding of general black hole imaging processes and provide a new approach to test gravitational theories through optical morphology studies.

 - **Abstract**
 In future space-borne \ac{GW} observations, matter arround the sources might influence the evolution and \ac{GW} signals from \ac{BBH} inspirals, which can be mistaken as deviations from \ac{GR}. Former research \cite{yuan2024} proposed a statistic $F$ that characterizes the dispersion of measured parameters to distinguish environmental effect(\ac{DF} from \ac{DM} spike) and theory of modified gravity effect(varying $G$). In this work we use the statistic to distinguish other couples of effects with \ac{GW} corrections at $-4$ PN order: \ac{DF} from \ac{DM} spike and the extra dimension theory, additionally try to determine the distinguishing threshold in more reasonable way to avoid arbitrariness, especially when the two effects to compare have more overlap in the $F$ distribution. Sources of different astronomical models are also considered, and two effects are still distinguishable but not much as in former work\cite{yuan2024}, so the threshold should be carefully selected. Following these procedures, we finally obtain the statistic thresholds of distinguishment between the three effects with \ac{GW} corrections at $-4$ PN order: \ac{DF} from \ac{DM} spike, the extra dimension theory, and varying $G$ theory. The method can be used to distinguish other effects among environmental effects and modified theories of gravity effects with the detections of \ac{GW} events.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the dynamics of charged and neutral particles in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild-like black hole immersed in an external magnetic field. We find that the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) for charged particles are systematically smaller than those of neutral particles, demonstrating a fundamental distinction in their orbital dynamics. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, charged particle ISCOs can approach arbitrarily close to the event horizon. We show that collisions between charged particles in ISCOs and neutral particles falling from infinity can produce unbounded center-of-mass energies in the strong-field regime, suggesting the black hole magnetosphere as a natural particle accelerator. Additionally, we apply the relativistic precession model to study quasi-periodic oscillations around the Schwarzschild-like black hole, treating orbital perturbations as coupled harmonic oscillators. Our results provide new insights into high-energy astrophysical processes near magnetized black holes and offer observational signatures through quasi-periodic oscillating frequencies that could be detected by current and future X-ray missions.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study the excitation of a compact star under the influence of external gravitational driving in the relativistic regime. Using a model setup in which a wave with constant frequency is injected from past null infinity and scattered by the star to future null infinity, we show that the scattering coefficient encodes rich information of the star. For example, the analytical structure of the scattering coefficient implies that the decay rate of a mode generally plays the role of ``star excitation factor'', similar to the ``black hole excitation factor'' previously defined for describing black hole mode excitations. With this star excitation factor we derive the transient mode excitation as a binary system crosses a generic mode resonance of a companion star during the inspiral stage. This application is useful because previous description of resonant mode excitation of stars still relies on the mode and driving force decomposition based on the Newtonian formalism. In addition, we show that the scattering phase is intimately related to the total energy of spacetime and matter under the driving of a steady input wave from infinity. We also derive the relevant tidal energy of a star under steady driving and compare that with the dynamic tide formula. We estimate that the difference may lead to $\mathcal{O}(0.5)$ radian phase modulation in the late stage of the binary neutron star inspiral waveform.

 We present a new method to search for gravitational waves from quasinormal modes in the ringdowns of the remnants of the mergers of the binary black hole systems. The method is based on maximum likelihood estimation. We derive a time-domain matched-filtering statistic that can be used to search for any number of modes in the data. The parameters of the modes can be estimated and the modes present in the data can be reconstructed. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the method by injecting the quasinormal mode waveforms to noise. We analyze performance of the method for searches of quasinormal modes in the advanced detectors data like LIGO and Virgo, in the third generation of detectors like Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and in the space detector LISA data. We analyze ringdown of publicly available GW190521 event and we compare our results with analysis by other methods.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study the influence of string fluids on the extended thermodynamic structure and microscopic interactions of Hayward black holes by employing thermodynamic geometry as an empirical tool. Using the novel equation of state obtained for regular black holes surrounded by string fluids, we analyze the extended phase space with enthalpy as the central thermodynamic potential. By examining the behavior of the normalized Ruppeiner curvature scalar $R_N$ in the temperature-volume $(T,V)$ plane, we analyzed the influence of the string fluid parameters on the microstructure of the black hole. Our analysis reveals that the presence of string fluids significantly modifies the dominant microscopic interactions, transitioning from attractive to repulsive regimes depending on the charge and volume of the black hole. We see that the thermodynamic curvature effectively detects critical points and phase transitions, reflecting the nature of repulsive or attractive interactions among black hole microstructures. We further investigate thermodynamic topology to provide a novel classification scheme for stability and phase behavior, delineating local stable and unstable regions in parameter space. We investigate the thermodynamic topology of Hayward-AdS black holes surrounded by string fluids, showing that the number and type of topological charges depend on the parameters $\epsilon$ and $b$, revealing phase transitions and stability characteristics encoded in the global topological charge $W$. This integrated study of the thermodynamic geometry and topology structure enhances the understanding of Hayward black holes surrounded by string fluids, showing overall thermodynamic stability and configuration with significant implications for holographic duality and potential astrophysical observations.
