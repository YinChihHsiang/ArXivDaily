 - **Abstract**
 There are several puzzling phenomena from recent JWST observations, which seem to push the standard {\Lambda}CDM cosmology over the edge. All those puzzles can be understood in a coherent way if we assume that first massive black holes (MBHs, the "heavy eggs") formed by directly collapsing from wave CDM haloes, which can be even earlier than the formation of first galaxies (the "chickens"). We elucidate two false obstacles that have been believed to prevent wave CDM haloes from collapsing into black holes (namely "maximum stable mass" and "bosenova") and point out that general-relativistic instabilities (e.g., the non-axisymmetric instability numerically found in spinning scalar-field boson stars) could serve as the concrete mechanisms for direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) born from wave dark matter. Once the MBHs formed, star formation bursts in and around the accretion flows, characteristic of a special mode in compact regions of high gravitational accelerations.

 - **Abstract**
 Over several dedicated programs that include targets beyond the main cosmological samples, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collected spectra for 311,102 unique objects in two fields centered on the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields. In this work, we develop spectroscopic redshift robustness criteria for those spectra, validate these criteria using visual inspection, and provide two custom Value-Added Catalogs with our redshift characterizations. With these criteria, we reliably classify 217,037 galaxies below z < 1.6, 9,688 quasars and 35,505 stars. As a critical element in characterizing the selection function, we provide the description of 70 different algorithms that were used to select these targets from imaging data. To facilitate joint imaging/spectroscopic analyses, we provide row-matched photometry from the Dark Energy Camera, Hyper-Suprime Cam, and public COSMOS2020 photometric catalogs. Finally, we demonstrate example applications of these large catalogs to photometric redshift estimation, cluster finding, and completeness studies.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarization observations of tidal disruption events offer unique insights into the accretion processes around supermassive black holes. Here, we present optical polarization observations of the nearby event AT 2023clx, obtained using the Nordic Optical Telescope. Our observations reveal a rise and subsequent decay in the polarization degree, temporally offset from the peak of the optical light curve, reaching maximum intrinsic polarization degree of $\sim$5 per cent. In addition, the polarization angle shifts by $\sim60^\circ-100^\circ$ between 6 to 20 days after the optical peak, remaining stable thereafter. Remarkably, the observed polarization variability closely resembles that of AT 2020mot, strongly suggesting a common mechanism for accretion disk formation in these events. The variability in both polarization degree and angle supports models in which tidal stream shocks drive the optical outburst during the accretion disk formation.

 - **Abstract**
 The fate of the remnant following the merger of two neutron stars initially on quasicircular orbits depends primarily on the mass of the initial neutron stars, the mass ratio, and the still-uncertain dense-matter equation of state (EoS). Previous works studying the threshold mass for prompt collapse to a black hole have primarily focused on the uncertainties in the zero-temperature EoS, which are parametrized by a macroscopic quantity such as the characteristic neutron star radius. However, prompt collapse can take place either with or without a core bounce during the merger. In the bounce-collapse scenario, shocks can produce additional thermal support, potentially altering the threshold for collapse. In this work, we investigate the impact of the uncertainties in the finite-temperature part of the nuclear EoS on the threshold mass for prompt collapse in equal mass mergers. Using two cold EoSs, combined with four parametrizations of the finite-temperature part of the EoS, we find that the threshold mass is insensitive to realistic variations of the thermal prescription, at sub-percent accuracy. We report on the thermal properties and ejecta of mergers with masses just above the threshold mass, i.e., which experience a single core-bounce before collapsing. During the bounce, the thermal pressure can reach )(1-10)% of the cold pressure at supranuclear densities, depending on the thermal treatment, leading to modest differences in the dynamical ejecta that are launched and in the remnant disk mass as a result.

#### Linear Polarization in a Black Hole, 4U~1957+115 and its X-ray Spectral Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new spectro-polarimetric method for estimation of the inclination of X-ray binaries using the linear polarization (LP) value in black hole (BH) sources, based on the early paper by Sunyaev \& Titarchuk (1985, ST85). The X-ray LP arises from multiple scattering of initially soft photons in a hot, optically thick Compton cloud (CC) using a flat geometry. ST85 showed that the LP degree $P$ depends on the binary inclination $i$ and remains independent of the photon energy. Moreover, the $P$ follows a characteristic angular distribution based on the CC optical depth $\tau_0$, in particular for $\tau_0 >$ 10 the LP follows the Chandrasekhar (1950) distribution. In light of the vast number of recent IXPE spectro-polarimetric observations of BHs, testing this approach in combination with spectral analysis of these sources by other missions is desirable. In particular, the BH source, 4U 1957+115 was observed with IXPE in the high/soft state for which $P\sim 2\%$ was found (Marra et al. 2024). To apply the new method, in addition to knowing $P$ for a given source, it is necessary to estimate the CC optical depth $\tau_0$ and then to calculate of the best-fit photon index $\Gamma$ and the plasma temperature $kT_e$. We present the X-ray spectral analysis of 4U~1957+11 using data from IXPE, NuSTAR, NICER, RXTE}, Swift, Suzaku and ASCA. We show that the X-ray source spectra are well described by the Comptonization model with $\Gamma$ varying from 1.5 to 3. We find a monotonic increase in $\Gamma$ with the mass accretion rate, $\dot M$, and a final saturation of the index at $\Gamma\sim3$ for high $\dot M$. We determine a BH mass by the scaling method: $M_{1957}=4.8 \pm 1.8~M_{\odot}$, assuming a source distance of 22 kpc, using H 1743-322, 4U 1630-47, and GRS 1915+105 as reference sources.

#### Supermassive Neutron Stars in Starobinsky Gravity with Causal Hybrid Stellar Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the stellar structure of neutron stars in the framework of Starobinsky gravity, characterized by a quadratic correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action, $f(R) = R + \alpha R^2$. In order to {\em preserve causality throughout\/} the star, we adopt a two-phase hybrid construction for the stellar matter, in which the core region consists of deconfined quark matter described by the MIT bag model, while the outer layers are composed of hadronic matter represented by unified equations of state such as SLy4, BSk20, and BSk21. Within this framework, we derive the modified field equations with static spherical symmetry, and numerically integrate the corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations with the chosen hybrid equations of state. Our analyses show that, unlike in general relativity, the Ricci scalar remains nonzero outside the stellar surface, and gradually falls to zero beyond 50 km, while the stellar surface remains within 10--12 km for the hybrid equations of state considered. This extended Ricci scalar profile arises from the extra degree of freedom (scalaron) inherent in Starobinsky gravity, which also contributes to the gravitational mass outside the star, causing the ADM mass measured at infinity to exceed the stellar mass at the surface. Nevertheless, the key physical relationships, such as the mass-central density and mass-radius curves, remain consistent with what is expected physically. Notably, we find that the maximum stable mass of neutron stars increases with the Starobinsky parameter $\alpha$, with the combined MIT-BSk21 model supporting an ADM mass of up to $2.07 \, M_\odot$ for $\alpha = 10\,r_g^2$. This theoreical limit for a nonrotating neutron star suggests that a rotating configuration could reach mass thresholds in the range of $2.48$ to $2.59 \, M_\odot$, considering that rapid rotation can enhance the maximum mass by approximately 20--25\%.

 - **Abstract**
 Powerful jetted radio sources for which the luminosity in directed kinetic energy has been empirically determined, independent of assumptions, are considered. The total outflow lifetime of each source determined in the context of detailed cosmological studies was found to depend only upon the luminosity in directed kinetic energy ($L$). The distributions of $L$, total outflow lifetime, and total outflow energy each have a broad range of values, as do the supermassive black hole masses. The total outflow energy relative to the black hole mass is a small number with a small dispersion. Three explanations of these remarkable results are considered. This could indicate (1) the efficiencies with which black hole irreducible mass is increased and spin mass energy is extracted during the outflow event, (2) that the merger of two supermassive black holes occurs over a timescale commensurate with the independently determined outflow lifetime and that these mergers lead to the production of the low-frequency gravitational wave background, or (3) that feedback shuts off black hole accretion due to energy injected into the ambient medium.

 - **Abstract**
 Searching for radio pulsars orbiting around the Galactic centre black hole (BH), Sagittarius A$^\star$ (Sgr A$^\star$), represents a holy grail goal for large-area radio telescopes, in particular for the Square Kilometre Array. Follow-up timing observation of such a PSR-Sgr A$^\star$ binary system with an orbital period $\lesssim O(1\,{\rm year})$ will bring forward a handful of new tests on different aspects of fundamental physics that are barely accessible with other means. However, mass perturbation in the Galactic centre harms the gravitational cleanness of PSR-Sgr A$^\star$ systems. In order to flexibly account for perturbations, a numerical pulsar timing model is gradually being built, which can be used to probe the spacetime around Sgr A$^\star$ BH and study the nature of dark matter.

#### GW231123: a Possible Primordial Black Hole Origin

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123, the heaviest binary black hole merger detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration to date, lies in the pair-instability mass gap and exhibits unusually high component spins. In this letter, we show that both merging black holes may have a primordial origin with smaller initial masses. The observed masses and, crucially, the spins of GW231123 are naturally accommodated within the most vanilla primordial black hole framework, once cosmological accretion is taken into account. Interestingly, the parameter space needed to explain the inferred GW231123 rate is at the edge of the exclusion region from Xray and CMB observations, suggesting that this interpretation can be either confirmed or ruled out. The upcoming O5 observing run by the collaboration should detect ${\cal O}(20)$ similar events, testing their mass-spin correlation, while next-generation detectors would be capable of observing high redshift events, as predicted in this scenario.

#### Study on deflection angle, shadow, quasinormal modes, and greybody factor of the black hole surrounded by quintessence in Rastall gravity

 - **Abstract**
 The present study focuses on investigating the deflection angle in the weak-field approximation, shadow, quasinormal modes using Lyapunov exponents, and lower bound of the greybody factor for a charged black hole surrounded by a quintessence field in Rastall gravity. The weak deflection angles are calculated using the Gauss-Bonnet method. They decrease with increasing impact parameter b and charge Q, but gradually increase with increasing black hole mass m. Notably, the presence of a surrounding quintessence field in Rastall gravity leads to a higher deflection angle compared to Schwarzschild or Reissner-Nordstrom black holes with positive Nq. The photon sphere and shadow of the black hole are analysed concerning the charge Q and mass m; they shrink as Q increases and expand with increasing m. We further analyse the quasinormal modes of the black hole, explicitly derive the coordinate time Lyapunov exponent {\lambda}c and the quasinormal frequency {\omega}. In the eikonal limit, the Lyapunov exponent ensures that the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes can be expressed by the frequency and instability time scale of the unstable null circular geodesics. Additionally, we derive the lower bounds of the greybody factor Gb; it decreases for increasing charge Q, while the increasing mass m enhances it. Importantly, all the findings reduce to those of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole for Nq=0 and to the Schwarzschild black hole for Nq=Q=0.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, the authors employ the analogy between continuum mechanics and general relativity to investigate, from the perspective of elasticity and crystal plasticity, the deformations of space measured by LIGO/VIRGO interferometers during the passage of gravitational waves over Earth. The results of different innovative or existing mechanical models are compared with each other and compared with the observations in the framework of general relativity and Einstein-Cartan theory. Despite limitations, there is a convergence of results: the polarizations of gravitational waves can be viewed as expressions of an equivalent elastic media deformation tensor. Additionally, an anisotropy of space properties is unavoidable at the measurement point of the gravitational wave if we rely on the current first-order general relativity, which predict that gravitational waves generate deformations only in transverse planes. It is demonstrated that the classical polarizations of general relativity can be associated with a state of pure torsion in the analogous elastic medium and acted upon by the rotation of massive bodies such as black holes. This approach involves a transverse isotropic medium composed of independent sheets that deform perpendicularly to the direction of propagation of these waves. Considering geometric torsion in general relativity, associated with plastic crystallography, allows for the examination of complementary polarizations in the direction of wave propagation. This makes it possible to connect these sheets and reconstruct a complete, coherent 3D environment.

 - **Abstract**
 There has been recently renewed interest in the quantisation of gravity by considering local subsystems on light-like hypersurfaces. The main purpose of this paper is to present a theory-independent perspective on these developments assuming only basic knowledge of quantum theory and general relativity. In addition, we present a top-down approach to constructing local amplitudes in causal diamonds. The fundamental building block is a slab of light-like geometry (e.g. a segment of a light cone embedded into spacetime). Each slab is a three-dimensional light-like hypersurface bounded by two cuts, its past and future corners. After briefly reviewing the timeless formalism of quantum theory, we equip each null slab a with a kinematical Hilbert space that factorizes into constituents associated to the three-dimensional interior and its two corners. Upon assuming the existence of vacuum states for the bulk and boundary symmetries and a fundamental projector onto physical states, we explain how to introduce local amplitudes by contracting boundary states according to the pattern of a causal diamond. Finally, we show that the resulting local transition amplitudes satisfy Ward identities and charge conservation for the underlying symmetries. The paper closes with a summary and discussion for how different approaches to quantum gravity can realise our proposal in practice.

#### Instant Folded Strings, Dark Energy and a Cyclic Bouncing Universe

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09745

 - **Abstract**
 We present a wholly self-consistent, complete cyclic bouncing cosmology based on components drawn from string theory and constructed in a way that is under perturbative control throughout (e.g., with temperature much less than the string scale and string coupling $g_s \ll 1$ at all times). The cyclic evolution is governed by standard dilaton-gravity in $(3+1)$-dimensions with a perturbatively generated potential and a coupling between the dilaton and a second field that becomes massless at $\phi= \phi_{ESP}$, resulting in an enhanced symmetry point (ESP) that prevents the dilaton from running all the way to zero coupling. A central role is played by instant folded strings (IFSs) - fundamental strings with the unusual property of being much lighter than the string mass while extending far beyond the string length, and violating the Null Energy Condition (NEC). IFSs are produced classically when the string coupling grows with time, which occurs at two critical points in each cycle. In turn, they fulfill a dual function: enabling cosmological bounces and initiating transient epochs of dark-energy domination that naturally transition into slow contraction. The resulting cosmology eliminates the cosmic singularity and multiverse problems of big bang inflationary models and robustly predicts time-varying IFS-induced dark energy and the absence of primordial B-mode polarization in the cosmic microwave background.

 - **Abstract**
 In this communication we address whether or not there is an equivalence between the kinematical and dynamical descriptions of the spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM model. We address this by investigating whether an almost $\Lambda$CDM expansion history ($j(z)\approx1$) corresponds to an almost $\Lambda$CDM model ($w_{\rm DE}(z)\approx-1$) by considering two particular explicit examples. At least for the cases considered, this turns out not to be the case. Instead, what we find is that an almost $\Lambda$CDM cosmic evolution rather corresponds to an \emph{almost unified dark fluid model}. Considering that one never gets the exact condition $j(z)=1$ from any cosmographic data sets, this raises further questions on whether the $\Lambda$CDM model is the best candidate for the standard model of the evolution of the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the strong gravitational lensing effects around the Reissner-Nordstr{ö}m-like black hole (RN-like BH) in bumblebee gravity. We calculate the lensing quantities such as deflection angle, radius of the photon sphere, angular separation, relativistic image characteristics, Einstein ring and time delay. By taking the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) like Sgr A*, M87*, NGC 1332, NGC 4649 etc. as RN-like BH, we compute the lensing observables and compare with the observables associated with the Reissner-Nordström black hole (RNBH). The quasinormal modes (QNMs) of massless Dirac field perturbation of Reissner-Nordstr{ö}m-de Sitter-like (RNdS-like) BH are also calculated. We discuss the behaviour of both real and imaginary parts of QNM frequencies with varying of $Q$ and $L$. It shows the damping rate and the oscillation frequency decrease with increasing $L$ but it has the opposite effect for the increase of $Q$. We further explore the detectability of QNMs by LIGO and LISA, and study the impact of $L$ and $Q$ on the detectable BH mass range. Further, we investigate the behaviour of greybody factor (GF) of RNdS-like BH in bumblebee gravity and find that the probability of wave transmission increases with increasing $L$ but decreases with the increase of $Q$. The behaviour of absorption cross section and sparsity of Hawking radiation for different values of $L$ and $Q$ are also analysed graphically.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss chaos and ensemble averaging in 1/2 BPS bubbling $AdS$ spaces of Lin, Lunin and Maldacena (LLM) by studying trapped and escaping null geodesics and estimating their decay rates. We find typical chaotic scattering behavior and confirm the Pesin relation between escape rates, Lyapunov exponents and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. On the other hand, for geodesics in coarse-grained (grayscale) LLM geometries (which exhibit a naked singularity) chaos is strongly suppressed, which is consistent with orbits and escape rates averaged over microscopic backgrounds. Also the singularities in these grayscale geometries produce an attractive potential and have some similarities to black hole throats trapping geodesics for a long time. Overall, averaging over the ensembles of LLM geometries brings us closer toward the typical behavior of geodesics in black hole backgrounds, but some important differences remain, in particular the existence of a threshold timescale when the averaging fails.

#### Extremal curves in single-trace $T\bar{T}$-holography

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we continue the study of single-trace $T\bar{T}$-holography where the boundary field theory can be realized as a CFT$_2$ deformed by a single-trace irrelevant operator of dimension $(2,2)$ and dual spacetime geometry is $AdS_3$ smoothly glued to flat spacetime with a linear dilaton near the boundary. In this non-AdS holographic framework, we propose that the length of real extremal curves connecting the two boundaries of an eternal black hole at fixed boundary time captures the time-evolved entanglement entropy of an entangled, quenched boundary system. At late times, we find two analytic extremal solutions in the complexified geometry, which become real in complementary temperature regimes. Focusing only on the real solutions leads to a non-analyticity at a critical temperature $T_c$, which we interpret as a second-order phase transition separating a local (CFT$_2$) phase from a non-local (Little String Theory) phase.
