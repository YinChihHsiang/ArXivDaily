#### A Deep Chandra View of Abell 2597: Bubbles, Shocks, Cold Fueling, and a Plasma Depletion Layer

 - **Abstract**
 To examine how AGN feedback shapes the intracluster medium (ICM) and fuels black hole accretion in the cool-core galaxy cluster Abell 2597, we present deep ($\sim$600 ks) Chandra X-ray observations complemented by archival GMRT radio and SINFONI near-infrared data. Radio-mode AGN activity has inflated seven X-ray cavities and driven one to three potential weak shocks ($M \sim 1.05-1.14$) extending to $\sim 150$ kpc, suggesting recurrent outbursts occurring on $\sim 10^7$ year timescales. We also detect a narrow, $\sim$57 kpc X-ray surface brightness deficit-a potential plasma depletion layer-likely shaped by residual sloshing motions that amplified magnetic fields and/or displaced gas within the cluster core. Although the AGN injects $\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ of energy, comparable to the cluster's cooling luminosity, radiative cooling persists at $\sim$15 M$_{\odot} $yr$^{-1}$, replenishing the billion solar mass cold gas reservoir at the heart of the brightest cluster galaxy. Sustaining this level of activity requires a continuous fuel supply, yet the estimated Bondi accretion power ($\sim 2 \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) falls an order of magnitude short of the observed cavity power, suggesting that "hot" gas fueling is insufficient. Instead, archival ALMA observations continue to support a chaotic cold accretion scenario, where turbulence-driven condensation fuels the AGN at rates exceeding Bondi accretion, sustaining a self-regulated feedback cycle that repeatedly shapes the core of Abell 2597.

 - **Abstract**
 The recent binary black hole (BH) merger GW231123, with both components likely in the high-mass gap and with high spins, challenges standard BH binary formation models. It is usually thought that the BHs are of second (or higher) generation (2G), resulting from the mergers of smaller BHs. But the physical processes that produce the merging 2G BH binaries are unclear and highly unconstrained. We show that such 2G mergers can be naturally produced in the nuclear star cluster of Milky Way-like galaxy. The dominant channel combines a sequence of binary-single interactions with secular evolution driven by the central supermassive BH. Our model produces a merger rate consistent with GW231123 and further predicts an abundant population of 2G BH-star (or low-mass BH) binaries; these binaries may observationally manifest as micro tidal disruption events or low-frequency gravitational-wave (GW) sources. Detecting these binaries would provide crucial insights into the dynamical pathways of hierarchical BH assembly.

#### Aletheia: Emulating the non-linear matter power spectrum in the context of evolution mapping

 - **Abstract**
 We present Aletheia, a new emulator of the non-linear matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, built upon the evolution mapping framework. This framework addresses the limitations of traditional emulation by focusing on $h$-independent cosmological parameters, which can be separated into those defining the linear power spectrum shape ($\mathbf{\Theta}_{\mathrm{s}}$) and those affecting only its amplitude evolution ($\mathbf{\Theta}_{\mathrm{e}}$). The combined impact of evolution parameters and redshift is compressed into a single amplitude parameter, $\sigma_{12}$. Aletheia uses a two-stage Gaussian Process emulation: a primary emulator predicts the non-linear boost factor as a function of ($\mathbf{\Theta}_{\mathrm{s}}$) and $\sigma_{12}$ for fixed evolution parameters, while a second one applies a small linear correction based on the integrated growth history. The emulator is trained on shape parameters spanning $\pm$5$\sigma$ of Planck constraints and a wide clustering range $0.2 < \sigma_{12} < 1.0$, providing predictions for $0.006\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1} < k < 2\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We validate Aletheia against N-body simulations, demonstrating sub-percent accuracy. When tested on a suite of dynamic dark energy models, the full emulator's predictions show a variance of approximately 0.2%, a factor of five smaller than that of the state-of-the-art EuclidEmulator2 (around 1% variance). Furthermore, Aletheia maintains sub-percent accuracy for the best-fit dynamic dark energy cosmology from recent DESI data, a model whose parameters lie outside the training ranges of most conventional emulators. This demonstrates the power of the evolution mapping approach, providing a robust and extensible tool for precision cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared-luminous galaxies are important sites of stellar and black hole mass assembly at most redshifts. Their luminosities are often estimated by fitting spectral energy distribution (SED) models to near- to far-infrared data, but the dependence of these estimates on the data used is not well-understood. Here, using observations simulated from a well-studied local sample, we compare the effects of wavelength coverage, signal-to-noise (S/N), flux calibration, angular resolution, and redshift on the recovery of starburst, AGN, and host luminosities. We show that the most important factors are wavelength coverage that spans the peak in a SED, with dense wavelength sampling. Such observations recover starburst and AGN infrared luminosities with systematic bias below $20\%$. Starburst luminosities are best recovered with far-infrared observations while AGN luminosities are best recovered with near- and mid-infrared observations, though the recovery of both are enhanced with near/mid-infrared, and far-infrared observations, respectively. Host luminosities are best recovered with near/far-infrared observations, but are usually biased low, by $\gtrsim20\%$. The recovery of starburst and AGN luminosity is enhanced by observing at high angular resolution. Starburst-dominated systems show more biased recovery of luminosities than do AGN-dominated systems. As redshift increases, far-infrared observations become more capable, and mid-infrared observations less capable, at recovering luminosities. Our results highlight the transformative power of a far-infrared instrument with dense wavelength coverage from tens to hundreds of microns for studying infrared-luminous galaxies. We tabulate estimates of systematic bias and random error for use with JWST and other observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 A massive "dark companion"-such as an intermediate-mass black hole or other compact dark object-orbiting the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center can dynamically reshape the surrounding dark-matter spike. Through gravitational heating and angular-momentum exchange, the companion excavates a "scoured" region that lowers the inner density and suppresses the expected annihilation signal. We quantify this effect by computing the suppression of the dark-matter annihilation $J$-factor induced by such a companion, combining an analytic scouring-radius model with full numerical integrations of the modified density profile. We scan the parameter space of companion mass, orbital separation, system age, and spike slope, explicitly including the interplay with the annihilation plateau. For canonical Gondolo-Silk spikes with $\gamma_{\rm sp} \gtrsim 2$, we find that the distribution is remarkably resilient and that the companion produces at most mild reductions of the $J$-factor. In contrast, for pre-heated or otherwise shallow spikes with $\gamma_{\rm sp} \lesssim 1.8$, even a modest $\sim 10^{4}\,M_\odot$ companion on a O(100) AU orbit and O(Gyr) age can suppress the annihilation flux by one to two orders of magnitude. The numerical results are accurately captured (typically at the $\lesssim 10\%$ level) by a simple fitting formula in terms of a dimensionless scouring parameter that measures the ratio between the scoured region and the annihilation core. Our findings demonstrate that neglecting a dark companion can lead to substantial overestimates of the Galactic Center $J$-factor, with direct consequences for interpreting gamma-ray, neutrino, and antimatter searches for annihilating dark matter.

#### Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking as a Late-Time Trigger for Interacting Dark Energy

 - **Abstract**
 Persistent tensions in the Hubble constant (H0) and the matter clustering parameter (S8) motivate late-time new physics that suppresses structure growth without significantly altering the background expansion history of the LambdaCDM model. We study a class of dark-sector dynamics in which a scalar dark energy field, governed by a Z2-symmetric quartic potential, interacts with dark matter through Yukawa and portal couplings. When the matter density drops below a critical threshold, a cosmological spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism generates a time-dependent vacuum expectation value v(a) and activates an effective coupling eta(a). This creates a symmetric phase (a <= ac) identical to LambdaCDM at early times, and a broken phase (a > ac) in which eta(a) > 0 transfers energy from dark matter to dark energy, suppressing linear structure growth. Using RSD, BAO, cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+SH0ES supernovae, and compressed Planck distance priors, we compare a fixed LambdaCDM background with a self-consistent coupled-scalar evolution. The RSD-only analysis shows a strong shift: the dynamical background gives Omega_m ~ 0.31 +/- 0.10 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.59 +/- 0.01, while the fixed-background case gives Omega_m ~ 0.20 +/- 0.09 and sigma8,0 ~ 0.75 +/- 0.05. In the full joint fit, we obtain Omega_m = 0.29 +/- 0.01, H0 = 69.7 +/- 0.6 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, and sigma8,0 = 0.78 +/- 0.01. A late-time interaction triggered by spontaneous symmetry breaking can therefore damp structure growth and ease the S8 tension while leaving the expansion history and the inferred H0 essentially unchanged, suggesting distinct physical origins for the two tensions.

#### Quarkyonic Neutron Stars as Candidates for the GW230529 Mass-Gap Object

 - **Abstract**
 We examine whether quarkyonic equations of state (EOS) can account for compact objects in the $2.5$-$4.5\,M_\odot$ mass range reported for the GW230529 gravitational-wave event. The pressure-energy density and mass-radius (M-R) relations obtained from quarkyonic EOS models indicate a significant stiffening at high densities, allowing stable configurations beyond $2.5\,M_\odot$. The predicted M-R sequences extend into the GW230529 mass window while maintaining radii in the range of $\approx 13$-$15$~km, suggesting that quarkyonic stars can naturally populate the so-called compact object mass gap. These results imply that the heavier component of GW230529 could plausibly be a massive quarkyonic neutron star rather than a low-mass black hole.

#### The Eddington Ratio Distribution of Narrow Line Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 We measure the Eddington ratio distribution of local optical narrow line active galactic nuclei (AGN) as a function of host galaxy properties, as a potential test of supermassive black hole growth and feedback models in galaxy formation theory. We base our sample on integral field spectroscopy from the MaNGA data in SDSS-IV's DR17. Starting with MaNGA's calibrated row-stacked spectra, we produce new spectroscopic data cubes with minimal covariance between spaxels and higher resolution point spread functions (PSF), and then extract line fluxes for the central PSF. Using the line ratio diagnostic techniques of Ji & Yan (2020), we identify AGN galaxies and determine their H$\beta$ and [O III] line luminosities. For all galaxies not identified as AGN, we determine the threshold line luminosity they would have needed to be identified as AGN. These luminosity thresholds are essential to determine, because many star forming galaxies likely host AGN of significant luminosity that are unidentified because they are outshone by star formation related emission. We show that ignoring these selection effects when measuring the Eddington ratio distribution would lead to biased results. From the H$\beta$ luminosities and luminosity detection thresholds, accounting for selection effects, we measure the luminosity and Eddington ratio distributions of Seyferts as a function of specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar mass. Defining $F_{\rm AGN}$ as the occurrence rate of AGN above a fixed Eddington ratio of $10^{-3}$, we find that $F_{\rm AGN}$ is constant or increasing with stellar mass for star forming galaxies and declines strongly with stellar mass for quiescent galaxies. At stellar masses $\log_{10} M_\ast > 10.25$, the occurrence rate increases monotonically with sSFR. These patterns reveal a complicated dependence of AGN activity on galaxy properties for theoretical models to explain.

 - **Abstract**
 High-resolution mapping of cosmic mass distribution is essential for a variety of astrophysical applications including understanding cosmic structure formation, and galaxy formation and evolution. However dark matter is not directly observed and therefore we need advanced methods for solving inverse problems to reconstruct the underlying cosmic matter distribution. Here, we train a generative diffusion model and use it in the Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) framework to reconstruct mass maps from Dark Energy Survey-Year 3 (DES-Y3) weak gravitational lensing data at high (1 arcminute) resolution. We show that the standard DPS results are biased, but they can be easily corrected by scaling the log-likelihood score during the diffusion process, yielding unbiased results with proper uncertainty quantification. The resulting mass maps reveal cosmic structures with enhanced detail, opening the door for improved astrophysical studies using the obtained mass maps.

 - **Abstract**
 Protoplanetary disks observed in millimeter continuum and scattered light show a variety of substructures. Various physical processes in the disk could trigger such features -- one of which that has been previously theorized for passive disks is the thermal wave instability -- the flared disk may become unstable as directly illuminated regions puff up and cast shadows behind them. This would manifest as bright and dark rings, and a staircase-like structure in the disk optical surface. We provide a realistic radiation hydrodynamic model to test the limits of the thermal wave instability in irradiated disks. We carry out global axisymmetric 2D hydrostatic and dynamic simulations including radiation transport with frequency-dependent ray-traced irradiation and flux-limited diffusion (FLD). We found that starlight-driven shadows are most prominent in optically thick, slow cooling disks, shown by our models with high surface densities and dust-to-gas ratios of sub-micron grains of 0.01. We recover that thermal waves form and propagate inwards in the hydrostatic limit. In contrast, our hydrodynamic models show bumps and shadows within 30 au that converge to a quasi-steady state on several radiative diffusion timescales -- indicating a long-lived staircase structure. We find that existing thermal pressure bumps could produce and enhance this effect, forming secondary shadowing downstream. Hydrostatic models with self-consistent dust settling instead show a superheated dust irradiation absorption surface with a radially smooth temperature profile without staircases. We conclude that one can recover thermally induced flared-staircase structures in radiation hydrodynamic simulations of irradiated protoplanetary disks using flux-limited diffusion. We highlight the importance of modeling dust dynamics consistently to explain starlight-driven shadows.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) from massive black hole (MBH) mergers will provide a novel way to probe the high-redshift universe and are key to understanding galactic dynamics and evolution. In this work, we analyze MBH mergers, their GW signals and detectability, as well as their population properties, using the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation - NINJA Simulation Suite. We discuss the effect of resolution and finite volume on the black hole mass function (BHMF), which in turn limits the mergers associated with low mass black holes, $M_{BH} \lesssim 10^{6.5} M_\odot$. We find the upper limit on the total mass of the MBH binaries detectable by LISA to be $\sim 10^{8.4} M_\odot$. We also find that adding time delays pertaining to dissipative processes like dynamical friction and stellar hardening during the final stages of the inspiral for which the simulation lacks sufficient resolution to model, considerably shifts the peak of redshift distribution of detectable binaries from $z\sim0.5$ to $z\sim0.1$. Time delays reduce the number of detectable GW events but on the other hand their signal-to-noise is increased. From the observational point of view, we find a strong correlation between the SFR and $L_{\rm bol}$ at high redshifts for the detectable LISA binaries. This may prove to be a future application in the coincident observation of MBH binaries by GW and electromagnetic observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes in our Universe are rarely truly isolated, being instead embedded in astrophysical environments such as plasma or dark matter. A particularly intriguing possibility is that light scalar fields form bound states around black holes, producing extended ''clouds'' known as gravitational atoms. When these clouds become sufficiently compact, the spacetime can no longer be described by a vacuum solution of General Relativity. In this regime, one can construct quasi-stationary, spherically symmetric, self-gravitating scalar gravitational-atom configurations. Here, we explore an observationally relevant aspect of these systems by computing their fundamental quasi-normal mode. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the axial modes in both the time and frequency domains, finding frequency shifts relative to the vacuum case that depends mostly on the compactness of the gravitational atom. For sufficiently compact configurations, these shifts may be detectable by current or future gravitational wave detectors.

#### Phase Space of SdS Geodesics and using the Cosmological Horizon to Observe a Black Hole

 - **Abstract**
 Light propagating from near a black hole horizon to the outside world is highly redshifted. In the limit that the emitter passes through the horizon, the redshift becomes infinite. In this sense the near horizon region is unobservable, as emission energies fall below some detectability bound. However, in Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS) spacetime there is a second, cosmological, horizon due to the positive cosmological constant. Judiciously placed observers can take advantage of the blueshift due to this horizon. The frequency of signals emitted from near the black hole can be shifted back upward to an observable value. This effect is computed for a variety of accelerated and geodesic observers. An analysis of radial and circular geodesics in SdS is a key component of the paper. We find a ``cresting-wave" shaped critical curve in the SdS-geodesic parameter space such that under the curve there are three circular orbits, on the curve there are two orbits, and elsewhere there is one. It is found that the best strategy for observing photons from an emitter falling into the black hole is for the receiver to be near the cosmological horizon and also moving towards the black hole. For photons emitted from the smallest circular orbit and received at the largest circular orbit, the nonzero cosmological constant enhances observations by a factor that varies from zero to three.

#### Exact, non-singular black holes from a phantom DBI Field as primordial dark matter

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14047

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first exact, non-singular black hole solution in General Relativity sourced by a Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scalar field. Crucially, the solution is exclusively supported by the phantom branch of the DBI action, dynamically replacing the central singularity with a regular core. The solution is asymptotically flat, possesses non-trivial scalar hair, and replaces the central singularity with a regular 2-sphere. The mechanism for singularity resolution is a dynamical kinetic stiffness -- analogous to shear thickening in non-Newtonian fluids -- which also explains the evasion of classical no-hair theorems. We show these black holes evaporate to a stable, non-singular, extremal Planck-scale relic. This provides a robust mechanism to evade standard evaporation constraints, opening a vast, previously forbidden mass window for light Primordial Black Holes to constitute dark matter. The model is testable via distinctive gravitational-wave signatures from its scalar hair.

 - **Abstract**
 The accelerated expansion of the universe poses a significant challenge to General Relativity. Non-local modifications to gravity have emerged as a compelling class of theories to address this dark energy puzzle. Building upon earlier proposals, we investigate a specific non-local modified gravity action incorporating terms like $R\Box^{-2}R$, $R^{\mu\nu}\Box^{-2}R_{\mu\nu}$, $R^{\mu\nu\sigma\delta}\Box^{-2}R_{\mu\nu\sigma\delta}$ and demonstrate that it provides a dynamical origin for a massive graviton by reducing to the standard and extended Fierz-Pauli action at the linearized level. A fixed-point analysis of the background cosmology reveals a stable de Sitter attractor, ensuring the model naturally drives accelerated expansion. Crucially, we investigate the cosmological perturbations and show that the theory's six propagating degrees of freedom are free from ghost instabilities. We further demonstrate that all large-scale tensor modes are dynamically stable and decay on the accelerating background. This ghost-free massive gravity extension provides distinct predictions for gravitational wave polarizations and is theoretically consistent with $\mathbf{\Lambda CDM}$ at late times, positioning it as a unique alternative to scalar-tensor models like $f(R)$ and Galileons. This robust stability at both the background and perturbative levels establishes our model as a consistent and compelling alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate late-time interacting cosmologies within the framework of generalized Rastall gravity, where the interaction arises naturally from the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor. We formulate the background evolution of the dark sector as an autonomous dynamical system, defining interaction terms $Q_1=\alpha\,\dot{f}$ and $Q_2=-\dot{f}\,(1+\alpha)$, with $\alpha$ a constant parameter and $f$ a time-dependent function. Three interaction cases are studied: $f \propto \rho_m$, $f \propto \rho_{de}$, and $f \propto \rho_m + \rho_{de}$, assuming a constant dark-energy equation of state $w_{de}$. For each scenario, we derive the closed dynamical system in terms of the density parameters $(\Omega_{de}, \Omega_m)$, identify its fixed points, and analyze their stability across the parameter space. In this context, the phase-space exhibits a standard cosmological dynamics: an unstable radiation point, a transient matter saddle, and a stable late-time attractor with accelerated expansion. In addition, we utilize a joint likelihood analysis with Cosmic Chronometers, PantheonPlus, and DESI data to obtain marginalized parameter estimates at the $68\%$ and $95\%$ confidence levels, constraining the parameter space in each interaction model.

 - **Abstract**
 In k-essence theories within general relativity, where the matter Lagrangian depends on a real scalar field $\phi$ and its kinetic term $X$, static and spherically symmetric compact objects with a positive-definite energy density cannot exist without introducing ghosts. We show that this no-go theorem can be evaded when the k-essence Lagrangian is extended to include a dependence on the field strength $F$ of a $U(1)$ gauge field, taking the general form ${\cal L}(\phi, X, F)$. In Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories with a scalar-vector coupling $\mu(\phi) F$, we demonstrate the existence of asymptotically flat, charged compact stars whose energy density and pressure vanish at the center. With an appropriate choice of the coupling function $\mu(\phi)$, we construct both electric and magnetic compact objects and derive their metric functions and scalar- and vector-field profiles analytically. We compute their masses and radii, showing that the compactness lies in the range ${\cal O}(0.01)<{\cal C}<{\cal O}(0.1)$. A linear perturbation analysis reveals that electric compact objects are free of strong coupling, ghost, and Laplacian instabilities at all radii for $\mu(\phi)>0$, while magnetic compact objects suffer from strong coupling near the center.

 - **Abstract**
 We give the first general construction of solutions of the static spherically symmetric Einstein-Euler equations, the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV-)equation, with prescribed density functions allowed to be discontinuous and non-uniform; these solutions describe stellar phase transitions in General Relativity. Boundedness of the resulting pressure functions solving the TOV-equations, from the boundary down to the stellar center, is obtained by identifying a novel condition on the prescribed density, in generalization of the classical Buchdahl limit. Moreover, we introduce a new necessary condition for the existence of such bounded pressure functions, which in the special case of a uniform density state reduces to the classical Buchdahl limit on the stellar mass-radius relationship. We present various examples to study the stellar mass-radius relationships resulting from our new conditions.

 In this paper, we investigate the accelerating phase of the Universe within the context of $f(R,L_m,T)$ gravity theory, where $R$, $L_m$, and $T$ represent the Ricci scalar, matter Lagrangian, and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. We focus on a particular form of modified gravity defined by $f(R,L_m,T) = R - \mu L_m T - \gamma$, with $\mu$ and $\gamma$ being positive constants. The matter sector is characterized by the Lagrangian density $L_m = -\rho$, where $\rho$ denotes the energy density of the cosmological fluid. We conduct an in-depth examination of the model using phase space analysis, thoroughly evaluating the evolution of cosmological solutions with dynamical system techniques. The results is illustrated through graphs in the phase space, the characteristics of critical points and the stable attractors within the proposed modified gravity $f(R,L_m,T)$ cosmological framework. We investigate the transition from the initial decelerating phase of the universe to its current accelerating phase. The behaviour of the EoS, deceleration parameter with the appropriate initial conditions have been investigated.

 - **Abstract**
 The interplay between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their surrounding environment is fundamental to understanding galactic evolution. This work investigates the influence of a cold dark matter (DM) halo on the dynamics of relativistic, low angular momentum, inviscid, and advective hot accretion flow onto a galactic SMBH. Modeling the spacetime geometry as a black hole embedded within various DM distributions, including those with a central density spike, we demonstrate that the presence of a DM halo, particularly one that is massive and compact, enhances the luminosity of the accretion disk. The dominant contribution to this luminosity originates from the inner regions of the flow, suggesting that luminosity measurements could serve as a valuable observational probe for the dense DM environments expected near galactic centers.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, using equivariant localization for foliations, we compute the on-shell action of a general class of supersymmetric solutions of five-dimensional gauged supergravity with vector multiplets. Unlike previous literature, we also allow for a non-trivial topology for the space-time as well as for the gauge fields. In practice, we achieve this by covering the spacetime manifold with patches and localizing in each patch. We derive a general formula for the on-shell action that depends on topological data only and can be used without a detailed knowledge of the solution. Our final result is relevant for the physically interesting examples of multi-center black holes, black rings and black lenses, topological solitons and Euclidean black saddles. We also show how to connect the topological data with the thermodynamic data: electrostatic potential, the magnetic fluxes and the possible flat connections of the solutions. Our formula for the on-shell action is derived in the context of gauged supergravity, but it is straightforward to take the ungauged limit. Thus, we reproduce known results for a large class of explicit asymptotically flat supersymmetric solutions, and we provide predictions for AdS solutions still to be found.

 - **Abstract**
 We extend a four-qubit quantum circuit model of black hole evaporation that enforces semi-causality, a condition that allows information to enter a black hole but strictly forbids any information from escaping from the interior to outside through the horizon. In this work, we introduce a controlled violation of this principle by inserting a parametric controlled-unitary gate that enables a tunable leakage of quantum information from the black hole interior to the exterior, while preserving global unitarity. By varying the deformation parameter, we study the evolution of entanglement entropy, mutual information, and entanglement negativity throughout the evaporation process. While the semi-causal case yields a Page-like entropy curve with vanishing late-time correlations, we find that even small violations of semi-causality produce a non-zero residual entropy and persistent negativity across the horizon. These features mimic quantum-gravity-induced effects such as remnant formation and horizon permeability, suggesting that minimal deviations from classical causality can leave long-lived imprints on black hole information dynamics.
