 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological constraints on a time-varying dark energy equation of state are often interpreted as evidence for a dynamical dark energy. In this Letter, we show that such interpretations are fundamentally limited by the integral structure through which the equation of state enters cosmological observables. The mapping from \omega(z) to distances involves successive integrations, which act as an intrinsic low-pass filter in redshift space. As a result, only a small number of slowly varying modes of \omega(z) are observationally accessible, while rapid or localized temporal variations are irretrievably suppressed. This limitation is independent of any specific parametrization and represents a structural property of Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker cosmology with distance-based probes.

 - **Abstract**
 Full sky coverage with 30-40 meter-class telescopes is essential to answer fundamental questions in Astrophysics, Cosmology, and Physics, such as the composition of the Universe and the formation of the first stars and supermassive black holes. An ELT/TMT-like telescope in the Northern Hemisphere is a fundamental and necessary facility to provide multiplexing of observing power, diversity of instrumentation, rapid response, and statistical power required to address the questions and the problems, current and future, unveiled by full sky observatories such as JWST, Euclid, or Roman space telescopes. The Northern ELT/TMT will expedite the study of unique, extreme, rare, transient, and/or high-energy events which will give the most information about fundamental Physics problems in the era of multi-messenger and time-domain Astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are dense, compact stellar systems only a few parsecs across, located at galaxy centers. Their small sizes make them difficult to resolve spatially. NSCs often coexist with massive black holes, and both trace the dynamical state and evolution of their host galaxies. Dense stellar environments such as NSCs are also ideal sites for forming intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). To date, spatially resolved NSC properties, crucial for reconstructing dynamical and star-formation histories, have only been obtained for galaxies within 5 Mpc, using the highest-resolution instruments on the current class of very large telescopes. This severely limits spectroscopic studies, and a systematic, unbiased survey has never been accomplished. Because the vast majority of known NSCs are located in the Northern Hemisphere, only a 30-m-class telescope in the North can provide the statistical power needed to study their physical properties and measure the mass of coexisting central black holes. We propose leveraging the capabilities of a 30-m-class Northern telescope to obtain the first comprehensive, spatially resolved survey of NSCs, finally allowing us to unveil their formation pathways and their yet unknown connection with central massive black holes.

#### White Dwarf Binaries: Probes of Future Astrophysics

 - **Abstract**
 White dwarf binaries are fundamental astrophysical probes. They represent ideal laboratories to test the models of binary evolution, which also apply to the sources of gravitational waves, whose detection led to the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Moreover, their final fate is intimately linked to Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), i.e. the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf following the interaction with a companion star, which have become the fundamental yardsticks on cosmological distance scales and led to the discovery of dark energy and the award of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. Finally, white dwarf binaries play a crucial role in influencing star formation and chemical evolution of the Galaxy by injecting energy into, and enriching, the interstellar medium with material ejected during nova eruptions and SN Ia explosions. In the next decade, the advent of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory will lead to the discovery of hundreds of thousands of white dwarf binaries. Nonetheless, the intrinsic faintness of the majority of these systems will prevent their spectroscopic characterisation with the instruments available in the 2030s. Hence ESO's Expanding Horizons call is timely for planning a future transformative facility, capable of delivering phase-resolved spectroscopic observations of faint white dwarf binaries, which are key to advancing our understanding of stellar and Galactic evolution and cosmology.

#### Super-Eddington Chimneys: On the Cooling Evolution of Tidal Disruption Event Envelopes

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of a compact accretion disk following a tidal disruption event (TDE) requires that the shocked stellar debris cool efficiently as it settles toward the black hole. While recent simulations suggest that stream dissipation occurs rapidly, how the weakly bound debris subsequently loses its thermal energy to assemble a compact disk near the circularization radius remains uncertain. We investigate this cooling process using axisymmetric radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of quasi-hydrostatic 'TDE envelopes', initialized with the total mass, angular momentum, and binding energy expected from a complete stellar disruption. The envelopes, supported by radiation pressure on large scales and rotation near the circularization radius, evolve through a combination of radiative diffusion, turbulent mixing, and polar outflows. In our fiducial model, a quasi-steady state is achieved in which a polar outflow radiates and expels matter at several times the Eddington luminosity. This enables the envelope to cool and contract, forming a dense, rotationally supported ring near the circularization radius, but on a timescale roughly ten times shorter than the naive photon-diffusion timescale. Comparative models without radiation transport confirm that cooling, not purely adiabatic evolution, is essential to driving this rapid inflow. Nevertheless, across a range of envelope masses, the effective envelope cooling time scales only weakly with its optical depth, implying that advective and wind-driven energy transport dominate over diffusion. Our results demonstrate the cooling-induced contraction, even absent viscosity and associated black hole accretion, can produce luminosities and large photosphere radii consistent with early UV/optical TDE emission. However, more quantitative light-curve predictions must incorporate self-consistent formation and feeding of the envelope by fall-back accretion.

#### Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients in the 2040s

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are a class of extragalactic transient of uncertain origin. Several hypotheses have been put forward which could feasibly be consistent with the sample number of events discovered thus far, including tidal disruption events around intermediate mass black holes, failed supernovae and mergers of stars with black holes. Whatever their origin, it is clear that better understanding LFBOTs will provide unique insight into the black hole formation/growth, central engine physics and transient-host galaxy interactions - themes which are expected to drive research in transient astronomy over the coming decades. The vast majority of LFBOTs are missed by current photometric surveys, or not efficiently selected for detailed follow-up. This white paper outlines the observing capabilities required on a 2040 timescale to maximise the discovery potential from these enigmatic events.

#### Supermassive black-hole imaging with a self-consistent electron-temperature prescription

 - **Abstract**
 The recent 230 GHz observations by the Event Horizon Telescope have resolved the innermost structure of the M87 galaxy, revealing a ring-like feature consistent with thermal synchrotron emission from a magnetized torus surrounding a rotating supermassive black hole. Moreover, Global Millimeter VLBI Array observations at 86 GHz have revealed a larger-scale, edge-brightened jet with clear signatures of non-thermal emission. The theoretical modelling of these observations involves advanced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized accretion disks around rotating black holes, together with the associated synchrotron emission, which is normally treated with simplified expressions for the electron temperature and assuming a purely thermal distribution. However, an important non-thermal component is expected to be present, making the thermal-emission model not only an approximation, but also a source of degeneracy in the modelling. In view of this, we here present the first application of an ab-initio approach to the electron temperature derived from microscopic simulations of turbulent collisionless plasmas. The novel method, which has no tuneable coefficients and is fully specified by the thermodynamical and magnetic properties of the plasma, provides a better description of the jet morphology and width at 86 GHz, as well as of the broadband spectral emission. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating microscopic plasma physics in black-hole imaging and emphasise the crucial role of magnetic reconnection in electron heating and acceleration processes.

#### Doubling NIRSpec/IFS capability to calibrate the single epoch black hole mass relation at high redshift

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of a large population of overmassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe challenges the validity of the BH-host galaxy coevolution framework. However, the reliability of the estimated BH masses (M$_{BH}$) is being questioned, as these are typically derived using single-epoch (SE) relations calibrated locally. Calibrating SE relations at high redshift would therefore enable more accurate M$_{BH}$ estimates and help identify potential biases. In this work, we release a data-reduction technique for JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations that doubles the effective wavelength coverage, enabling detection of otherwise inaccessible emission. Whenever adjacent dispersers are required, observers should carefully evaluate the tradeoff between integrating longer in the bluer configuration alone versus distributing the exposure time across two dispersers. We apply this pipeline to a sample of 5 quasars at z~2 with M$_{BH}$ independently measured through reverberation mapping (RM). This enables a joint analysis of both H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$; the latter lying beyond the nominal wavelength range. We assess the reliability of the most widely adopted SE calibrations, finding that H$\beta$ yields the closest agreement with RM-based M$_{BH}$ estimates, whereas H$\alpha$-based estimators exhibit a larger scatter. For the least massive BH in our sample ($M_{BH,RM}$~$10^{7.5}M_\odot$), which is accreting at a rate close to the Eddington limit ($\lambda_{Edd}=0.8$), all SE calibrators overestimate M$_{\rm BH, RM}$ by one order of magnitude. This may indicate a systematic overestimation of M$_{BH}$ for highly accreting BHs at high redshift. Finally, we provide the first high-redshift SE calibration based on H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$. Although a larger sample is needed to reduce the uncertainties, our calibration can already be applied to the newly discovered BH population in the early Universe.

#### A milli-Tidal Disruption Event Model for GRB$\;$250702B: Main Sequence Star Disrupted by an IMBH

 - **Abstract**
 GRB$\;$250702B is the longest GRB recorded so far, with multiple gamma-ray emission episodes spread over a duration exceeding $25\;$ks and a weaker soft X-ray pre-peak $\sim1\;$day gradually rising emission. It is offset from its host galaxy center by $\sim5.7\;$kpc, and displays a long-lived afterglow emission in radio to X-ray. Its true nature is unclear, with the two leading candidate classes of objects being a peculiar type of ultra-long GRB and a tidal disruption event (TDE) by an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). Here, we consider the latter, mTDE origin. We model the afterglow data, finding a stratified external density profile $\propto r^{-k}$ with $k=1.60\pm0.17$, consistent with Bondi accretion of the interstellar medium (of initial number density $n_{\rm ISM}=n_0\;{\rm cm^{-3}}$ and sound speed $c_s=c_{s,6}10^6\;{\rm cm\,s^{-1}}$) for which $n(r)\approx n_{\rm ISM}(r/R_{\rm B})^{-3/2}$ within the Bondi radius $R_{\rm B}$. Moreover, we use the implied density normalization to infer the IMBH mass within this model, finding $M_\bullet\approx\left(6.55^{+3.51}_{-2.29}\right)\times10^3\,n_0^{-2/3}\,c_{s,6}^{2}(1+\mathcal{M}^2)\;M_\odot$ where $\mathcal{M}\equiv v_{\rm BH}/c_s$ is the IMBH's Mach number relative to the ISM. Together with an upper limit on $M_\bullet<\frac{c^3}{G}\frac{t_{\rm MV}}{1+z} \lesssim5\times10^4\,M_\odot$ from the source-frame minimum variability time $t_{\rm MV,src}\!=\!\frac{t_{\rm MV}}{1+z}\!\approx\!0.5\;$s this implies $v_{\rm BH}\lesssim 28\,n_0^{1/3}\;{\rm km\;s^{-1}}$. We show that a mTDE of a main-sequence star (but not of a white dwarf) can explain the duration and energetics of GRB$\;$250702B. The gradual rise to the peak may be caused by gradual circularization and accretion disk buildup, leading to an increase in the jet's power and Lorentz factor.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) on the mergers of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background. ULDM is based on exceptionally light particles and yields galactic halos with dense central solitons. This increases the drag experienced by binary SMBH, decreasing merger times and potentially suppressing gravitational radiation from the binary at low frequencies. We develop semi-analytic models for the decay of SMBH binaries in ULDM halos and use current pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements to constrain the ULDM particle mass and its fractional contribution to the dark matter content of the universe. We find a median ULDM particle mass of $7. \times 10^{-22}$ eV and show that scaling relations suggest that the drag remains effective at relatively low ULDM fractions, which are consistent with all other constraints on the model. Consequently, future pulsar timing measurements will be a sensitive probe of any ULDM contribution to the overall dark matter content of the universe.

#### Beyond Stage IV: Quasar and Galaxy Clustering and the Fundamental Physics of the 2040s

 - **Abstract**
 Stage IV galaxy surveys (DESI, 4MOST, MOONS, Euclid) are establishing precision constraints on cosmological parameters through baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions, yet fundamental questions on neutrino masses, inflationary physics, and the nature of gravity remain beyond their reach. We present a science case for next-generation wide-field spectroscopic surveys targeting $1 < z < 6$ with simultaneous observations of thousands of galaxies, quasars, and emission-line galaxies. Such surveys would deliver transformative advances: (i) cosmological constraints on absolute neutrino masses ($\Sigma m_\nu \lesssim 0.015\,\mathrm{eV}$), three times more stringent than Stage IV, enabling resolution of the neutrino mass hierarchy; (ii) detection of primordial non-Gaussianity at the level of $f_{\mathrm{NL}} \sim 1$, probing multi-field inflation; (iii) measurements of structure growth $f\sigma_8(z)$ spanning cosmic time to constrain dark energy and test gravitational modifications. Achieving these goals requires revolutionary advances in spectroscopic multiplexing ($\mathcal{O}(1000)$ simultaneous spectra), sub-$2\times10^{-4}(1+z)$ redshift precision at scale, and field-level inference techniques exploiting higher-order clustering statistics. We demonstrate that the proposed Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope concept provides a technically feasible and scientifically compelling path to unlock the physics of neutrinos, inflation, and gravity that will remain inaccessible to Stage IV surveys.

#### Comparing cosmic shear nulling methods for Stage-IV surveys

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15604

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis comparing nulling strategies for reducing the impact of baryon feedback on cosmic shear measurements. We consider three different approaches which aim to `null' the high-$k$ modes using transformations applied to the data vector: the Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya (BNT) transform which operates on the lensing field, a new implementation of an LU factorisation of the discretized Limber integral (LUnul) which operates on the lensing two-point statistics, and finally a method which uses a correlated LSS tracers to suppress contributions from lower redshifts (cross-correlation). We compare these methods to un-nulled (or standard) cosmic shear at the data vector level and assess whether these methods are able to reduce the bias on cosmological constraints using a Fisher forecast. We find that the nulling techniques considered can have a large impact on reducing the bias on $S_8$ and Dark Energy parameters. The cross-correlation method is effective at reducing biases in $S_8$, but requires additional information from galaxy clustering. The LUnul method is the most aggressive of the methods and hence reduces biases most efficiently as $k_{\rm max}$ is increased, although this improvement in accuracy comes at the cost of precision. The BNT approach preserves more information than LUnul, and has a more rigorous theoretical grounding. We demonstrate that all three of these methods are effective at mitigating bias, and can be readily applied in forthcoming lensing analyses.

#### Note on bulk viscosity as an alternative to dark energy

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15633

 - **Abstract**
 Bulk viscosity, which characterizes the irreversible dissipative resistance of a fluid to volume changes, has been proposed as a potential mechanism for explaining both early- and late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. In this work, we investigate two distinct physical scenarios for the origin of bulk viscosity: (1) nonminimal interactions between two fluids, and (2) elastic collisions in an ideal gas. In both cases, we demonstrate that while the associated energy-momentum exchange can significantly influence fluid dynamics, overall energy-momentum conservation precludes such exchange from having any direct gravitational effect in the context of General Relativity. In case (1), we show that the standard bulk viscous energy-momentum tensor can be obtained for the two-fluid system only at the cost of the violation of all classical energy conditions: null, weak, dominant, and strong. In case (2), we consider a single fluid composed of point particles undergoing instantaneous, energy- and momentum-conserving collisions, and find that the proper pressure remains strictly non-negative, with the equation-of-state parameter confined to the interval $[0,1/3]$. In both scenarios, achieving a sufficiently negative effective pressure to drive cosmic acceleration requires assumptions that compromise the physical viability of the model. Our results highlight some of the key physical challenges involved in modeling dark energy through bulk viscous effects.

#### Gravitational decoupling and regular hairy black holes: Geodesic stability, quasinormal modes, and thermodynamic properties

 - **Abstract**
 The stability of geodesic orbits around a regular hairy black hole, in the gravitational decoupling setup, is investigated by employing Lyapunov exponents, which quantify the divergence rate of nearby trajectories in dynamical systems. Both timelike and null geodesics are addressed, probing the effect of the hair parameter on orbital stability. Deviations from the Schwarzschild solution have a significant influence on orbit stability, potentially providing observational signatures. Quasinormal modes of regular hairy black holes are calculated, and their thermodynamic properties are discussed. Both the Rényi and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropies are reported, deepening our understanding of gravitational dynamics in the strong-field regime, contributing to ongoing approaches to modified gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 We review a novel scenario for the emergence of spin-polarisation entangled squeezed graviton states from superradiant axionic clouds in the neighborhood of astrophysical rotating black holes (BHs). The entangled squeezed graviton states are produced by both, conventional General-Relativity (GR) type axion-gravity interactions, and gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS) anomalous terms coupled to axions, which are non-trivial in the presence of rotating BHs. The two kinds of terms have different-symmetry contributions to the entangled squeezed states. The squeezing parameter is estimated in a weak-quantum-gravity framework. Some phenomenology with respect to current and future interferometric detection devices is discussed. Importantly, current data from LIGO/Virgo Experiments can impose upper-bound constraints on the value of the squeezing parameter and, thus, on the lifetime of the axionic clouds. In addition to the above rather direct-detection possibility of squeezed gravitons, there is also the possibility of indirect detection of quantum gravitons in Cosmology, given that chiral quantum gravitational-wave (GW) perturbations in the primordial Universe may imply condensation of gCS terms. This, in turn, leads to inflation of running vacuum type, with in principle observable patterns in the profile of the GW produced during the post-inflationary early radiation era, as well as the potential of alleviating cosmic tensions in the current era.

 - **Abstract**
 This thesis investigates late-time cosmic acceleration using modified gravity theories with a focus on $f(Q)$ gravity, as an alternative to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The standard cosmological model attributes the acceleration to a cosmological constant, but it faces issues like the unexplained nature of dark matter and dark energy and discrepancies with certain observations. Modified gravity including $f(Q)$ gravity, offers a potential solution by incorporating dynamic dark energy or changes to gravitational interactions, avoiding the need for a constant cosmological term. Also, thesis evaluates the viability of $f(Q)$ gravity by analyzing observational data from Type Ia Supernovae, Hubble parameter measurements and other cosmological datasets. Using statistical tools like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, this work constrains the parameters of $f(Q)$ gravity and compares it to the $\Lambda$CDM model.....

 - **Abstract**
 A small fraction of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binary black holes (BBHs) will be gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies and galaxy clusters. Strong lensing will produce multiple identical copies of the GW signal arriving at different times. Jana et al.~\cite{Jana_2023} recently proposed a method to constrain cosmological parameters using strongly lensed GW events detected by next-generation (XG) detectors. The idea is that the number of strongly lensed GW events and the distribution of their lensing time delays encode imprints of the cosmological parameters. From the observed number of lensed GW events (tens of thousands) and their time delay distribution, this method can provide a new probe of cosmology, obtaining information at intermediate redshifts. In this work, we explore the possibility of doing lensing cosmography using upcoming observations of the upgraded LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. This requires incorporating the detector network selection effects in the analysis, which was neglected earlier. We expect dozens of lensed GW events to be detected by upgraded LVK detectors, potentially enabling modest constraints on cosmological parameters. Even with relatively modest numbers of lensed detections, we demonstrate the potential of lensing cosmography. For XG detectors, our revised forecasts are consistent with with the earlier forecasts that neglected the selection effects.

 - **Abstract**
 A pulsar, i.e., a spinning neutron star, with a deformation could emit gravitational waves continuously. Such continuous waves, which have not been detected yet, will be very useful to study gravitational physics and to probe the extreme physics of neutron stars. While typically such waves from a pulsar are estimated considering an overall stellar ellipticity, there can be multiple irregularities or mountains in the stellar crust that the gravity of the star cannot smooth. In this paper, we consider this realistic situation and compute the strain, power, torque and the pulsar spin-down rate due to multiple mountains supported by the stellar crust. Here, we consider astronomically motivated mountain distributions and use the Brans-Dicke theory of gravity which has three polarization states: two tensors dominated by the time-varying quadrupole moment and one scalar dominated by the time-varying dipole moment. We also give the limiting results for general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 Noncommutative gravity, based on a twist-deformation of the differential geometry of spacetime and a first-order formulation of the dynamics, requires additional gravitational degrees of freedom as well as an enlargement of the gauge group of Lorentz transformations of the tetrad frame. As such, it offers a theoretical playground to build fundamentally motivated extension to general relativity. The dynamical degrees of freedom include a ${\rm GL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ gauge connection and two independent tetrads. The theory allows for interaction terms between the two tetrads, whose structure displays some similarities with ghost-free bigravity. The extra gravitational degrees of freedom survive in the commutative limit. We show the effective action obtained in this limit, discuss its symmetries, and compare it with other bigravity theories. The dynamics of homogeneous and isotropic cosmological solutions split into two branches. One is characterized by a constant and purely spatial curvature two-form. The other displays a richer gauge freedom, and the Hamiltonian analysis of the dynamics reveals three extra first-class constraints in addition to the generator of time reparametrizations.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate quartically self-interacting massive boson stars by constructing equilibrium sequences and performing dynamical evolutions. The mass curve $M(|\phi_c|)$ along these sequences develops multiple extrema, yet stability changes only at the first maximum; configurations beyond it become highly compact and collapse under numerically induced perturbations, with near-critical models displaying a short-lived double-dive behaviour. Head-on collisions of equal-mass stars yield three distinct outcomes - boson star remnants, black hole formation at contact, and collapse of each star to a black hole prior to contact. The associated gravitational-wave energies reflect the competition between increasing compactness and decreasing tidal deformability, and at large self-interaction strengths the collapse-before-contact branch exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic structure. The simulations reported here constitute a substantial catalogue of initial conditions and waveforms, providing a natural basis for neural-network techniques aimed at improving boson star initial data and constructing surrogate models capable of rapidly predicting gravitational-wave signals across an extended parameter space.

 - **Abstract**
 The optical fiber is a revolutionary technology of the past century. It enables us to manipulate single modes in nonlinear interactions with precision at the quantum level without involved setups. This setting is useful in the field of analogue gravity (AG), where gravitational phenomena are investigated in accessible analogue lab setups. These lecture notes provide an account of this AG framework and applications. Although light in nonlinear dielectrics is discussed in textbooks, the involved modelling often includes many assumptions that are directed at optical communications, some of which are rarely detailed. Here, we provide a self-contained and sufficiently detailed description of the propagation of light in fibers, with a minimal set of assumptions, which is relevant in the context of AG. Starting with the structure of a step-index fiber, we derive linear-optics propagating modes and show that the transverse electric field of the fundamental mode is well approximated as linearly polarized and of a Gaussian profile. We then incorporate a cubic nonlinearity and derive a general wave envelope propagation equation. With further simplifying assumptions, we arrive at the famous nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which governs fundamental effects in nonlinear fibers, such as solitons. As a first application in AG, we show how intense light in the medium creates an effective background spacetime for probe light akin to the propagation of a scalar field in a black hole spacetime. We introduce optical horizons and particle production in this effective spacetime, giving rise to the optical Hawking effect. Furthermore, we discuss two related light emission mechanisms. Finally, we present a second optical analogue model for the oscillations of black holes, the quasinormal modes, which are important in the program of black hole spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider Einstein-Maxwell gravity in diverse dimensions and construct the small charge perturbation to the extremal rotating black holes with all equal angular momenta in odd $D=2n+1$ dimensions. Exact solutions exist at the next-to-leading order (NLO), and they are analytic, allowing us to obtain the charge corrections to thermodynamic quantities at this order. Irrational exponents in the near-horizon power-series expansion emerge at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). We show, by numerical computation, that these horizon geometries can indeed be integrated out to asymptotic Minkowski spacetime, thereby proving the existence of the unusual singular horizon behavior of the extremal charged rotating black holes.

#### Thermal spectral function asymptotics and black hole singularity in holography

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the analytic structure of thermal spectral function of holographic CFTs, synthesizing recent developments into a set of observations about its asymptotics. Specifically, for a class of scalar primaries with integral dimension, we demonstrate factorization of the exact spectral function into a polynomial piece, which captures the vacuum dynamics, and a non-perturbative piece, which controls its asymptotics. Using exact WKB techniques, we derive a transseries expression for the latter. We use this information to deduce the singular loci of a spatially averaged thermofield double correlator in the complex time plane. Such singularities have been argued to encode information regarding the black hole singularity in the dual spacetime. Our results give a refinement of these statements by capturing the momentum dependence.
