 - **Abstract**
 Each galaxy is observed only once along its life, making galaxy evolution fundamentally an inverse statistical problem: time-dependent physics must be inferred from ensembles of single-epoch snapshots. To move beyond descriptive scaling relations toward physical regulation mechanisms of star formation, quenching, chemical enrichment and black hole growth, galaxies must be treated as realizations of a stochastic process whose hyper-parameters (e.g., correlation timescales, burstiness, duty cycles) are inferred hierarchically. This demands both depth and scale: continuum S/N sufficient for absorption-line ages and chemistry, and samples far larger than those in SDSS, DESI, 4MOST or MOONS, which provide either depth or size but not both across $0<z<3$. Once the relevant axes of mass, redshift, environment, structure and evolutionary phase are populated, the requirement naturally rises from $10^7$ to $\sim10^8$ galaxies. This is the regime where stochastic hyper-parameters can be well constrained and where comparisons to simulations and cosmological forward models become limited by theory rather than observations. We outline the science enabled by such a programme and the corresponding requirements for a future ESO wide-field spectroscopic facility capable of delivering tens to hundreds of millions of rest-UV-optical spectra over $0\lesssim z\lesssim3$.

 - **Abstract**
 One of JWST's most unexpected discoveries is the emergence of "Little Red Dots'' (LRDs): compact sources at $z \gtrsim 3$ with blue rest-frame UV continua, red optical slopes, and broad Balmer emission lines that challenge standard models and suggest a population of early, unusual active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Using a comprehensive photometric selection and public NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy across six JWST deep fields, we identify a large sample of 118 LRDs with high-S/N spectra, enabling a population-wide analysis of their UV--optical continuum and emission lines. We find clear correlations between rest-frame color ([0.3-0.9\,$\mu$m]) and slopes: bluer LRDs have blue UV slopes ($\beta_{\nu,\mathrm{UV}} \sim 0.3$) and red optical slopes, while redder LRDs exhibit redder UV slopes ($\beta_{\nu,\mathrm{UV}} \sim 1.1$). The continuum shape shows a similar trend: redder LRDs display prominent Balmer breaks and curvature, while bluer LRDs follow power-law-like optical SEDs. From literature compilations, $\sim$60% of known broad-line AGNs satisfy our LRD criteria, and up to 90% of LRDs show broad Balmer lines. Emission-line diagnostics reveal a shift from high H$_{\alpha}$/H$_{\beta}$ and low [OIII]$\lambda5007$/H$_{\beta}$ in redder LRDs to the opposite in bluer ones, along with stronger narrow-line equivalent widths, suggesting a transition from AGN- to host-dominated emission. We fit the spectra with a two-component model combining a gas-enshrouded black hole (BH) and a galaxy host. Redder LRDs require higher-luminosity, unreddened BHs and modestly reddened hosts; bluer LRDs require lower-luminosity, reddened BHs and dust-free galaxies. This framework reproduces the diversity in colors and spectral shape by varying BH luminosity, obscuration, and host-to-BH luminosity ratio.

 - **Abstract**
 DESI DR2 data have been widely interpreted as evidence for late-time evolving dark energy (DE) with an apparent phantom crossing. Here we investigate an alternative explanation, based on early-Universe physics. If dark acoustic oscillations (DAO) are close in scale to baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), they can bias the extraction of the BAO scale from the peak in the galaxy correlation function. This leads to an apparent shift in the inferred distance if the superposition of BAO and DAO features is misinterpreted as being due to BAO only. Taking this shift into account, we find that a DAO with percent-level amplitude can reconcile DESI DR2 with Planck 2018 as well as Pantheon+ supernovae data, with fit improvement at a similar level as compared to evolving DE. Notably, a DAO feature with the required properties has been predicted in a previously proposed scenario that resolves the Hubble tension via a pre-recombination decoupling of dark matter and dark radiation (DRMD). The presence of a DAO feature close to the BAO peak can be scrutinized with future full-shape galaxy clustering data from DESI and Euclid.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous quasars at the redshift frontier z>7 serve as stringent probes of super-massive black hole formation and they are thought to undergo much of their growth obscured by dense gas and dust in their host galaxies. Fully characterizing the symbiotic evolution of SMBHs and hosts requires rest-frame optical observations that span spatial scales from the broad-line region to the ISM and CGM. JWST now provides the necessary spatially resolved spectroscopy to do so. But the physical conditions that regulate the interplay between SMBHs and their hosts at the highest redshifts, especially the nature of early feedback phases, remain unclear. We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of J0313$-$1806 at z=7.64, the most distant luminous quasar known. From the restframe optical spectrum of the unresolved quasar, we derive a black hole mass of $M_\mathrm{BH}=(1.63 \pm 0.10)\times10^9 M_\odot$ based on H$\beta$ and an Eddington rate of $\lambda=L/L_\mathrm{Edd}=0.80\pm 0.05$, consistent with previous MgII-based estimates. J0313-1806 exhibits no detectable [O III] emission on nuclear scales. Most remarkably, we detect an ionized gas shell extending out to $\sim 1.8$ kpc traced by H$\beta$ emission that also lacks any significant [O III], with a $3\sigma$ upper limit on the [O III]$ \lambda$5007 to H$\beta$ flux ratio of $\log_{10} \left( F(\mathrm{[OIII]})/F(\mathrm{H}\beta)\right)=-1.15$. Through photoionization modelling, we demonstrate that the extended emission is consistent with a thin, clumpy outflowing shell where [OIII] is collisionally de-excited by dense gas. We interpret this structure as a fossil remnant of a recent blowout phase, providing evidence for episodic feedback cycles in one of the earliest quasars. These findings suggest that dense ISM phases may play a crucial role in shaping the spectral properties of quasars accross cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 Here we summarize discussions and conclusions from the conference ``The Era of Binary Supermassive Black Holes: Coordination of Nanohertz-Frequency Gravitational-Wave Follow-up,'' held at the Aspen Center for Physics from February 2-7, 2025. The meeting facilitated a crucial knowledge exchange between electromagnetic and gravitational-wave theorists, observers, and cyber-infrastructure experts. The central goal was to guide the development of multi-messenger follow-up strategies for binary supermassive black hole detections by pulsar timing arrays. To build a common basis of understanding for the broader scientific community, this summary outlines the main considerations and recommendations from the meeting, summarizes the knowledge gaps identified, and ends with a potential roadmap to catalyze discussion about the search for electromagnetic counterparts to massive black hole binaries detected by pulsar timing arrays.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a joint cosmological analysis of projected galaxy clustering observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1), and overlapping weak gravitational lensing observations from three datasets: the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000), the Dark Energy Survey (DES-Y3), and the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Survey (HSC-Y3). This combination of large-scale structure probes allows us to measure a set of $3 \times 2$-pt correlation functions, breaking the degeneracies between parameters in cosmological fits to individual observables. We obtain mutually-consistent constraints on the parameter $S_8 = \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.786^{+0.022}_{-0.019}$ from the combination of DESI-DR1 and DES-Y3, $S_8 = 0.760^{+0.020}_{-0.018}$ from KiDS-1000, and $S_8 = 0.771^{+0.026}_{-0.027}$ from HSC-Y3. These parameter determinations are consistent with fits to the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background dataset, albeit with $1.5-2\sigma$ lower values in the $S_8-\Omega_{\rm m}$ plane. We perform our analysis with a unified pipeline tailored to the requirements of each cosmic shear survey, which self-consistently determines cosmological and astrophysical parameters. We generate an analytical covariance matrix for the correlation data including all cross-covariances between probes, and we design a new blinding procedure to safeguard our analysis against confirmation bias, whilst leaving goodness-of-fit statistics unchanged. Our study is part of a suite of papers that present joint cosmological analyses of DESI-DR1 and weak gravitational lensing datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a joint $3\times2$-pt cosmological analysis of auto- and cross-correlations between the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1) Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) and Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) samples and overlapping shear measurements from the KiDS-1000, DES-Y3 and HSC-Y3 weak lensing surveys. We perform our analysis in configuration space and, in addition to the cosmic shear correlation functions for each weak lensing dataset, we fit the tangential shear of the weak lensing source galaxies around DESI lens galaxies. Finally, we make use of the anisotropic BGS and LRG clustering information by fitting the full shape of the two-point correlation function multipoles measured over the full DESI-DR1 footprint, presenting the first full-shape analysis of DESI measurements in configuration space. We find that the addition of weak lensing information serves to improve, with respect to the clustering-only case, the measurements of the power spectrum amplitude parameters $\ln(10^{10}A_{\rm{s}})$ and $\sigma_{12}$ by $15\%$ and $36\%$, respectively. It also improves measurements of the linear bias of the lens galaxies by $15-20\%$, depending on the tracer. Our results show excellent consistency, regardless of the weak lensing survey considered, and are furthermore consistent with a companion analysis that fits $3\times2$-pt correlations including DESI projected clustering measurements, as well as the results published by the weak lensing collaborations themselves. Our measured values for weak lensing amplitude are $S_{8}^{\mathrm{DESI\times HSC}}=0.787\pm0.020$, $S_{8}^{\mathrm{DESI\times DES}}=0.791\pm0.016$, $S_{8}^{\mathrm{DESI\times KiDS}}=0.771\pm0.017$, which are $1.9\sigma-2.9\sigma$ below the $S_8$ value preferred by Planck. Finally, our clustering-only results are in good agreement with the Fourier space full-shape analysis of all DESI tracers.

 - **Abstract**
 We present constraints on cosmic structure growth from the analysis of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing with galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1. We analyze four samples drawn from the Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) and the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) target classes. Projected galaxy clustering measurements from DESI are supplemented with lensing measurements from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), and the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey around the same targets. Our method relies on a simulation-based modeling framework using the AbacusSummit simulations and a complex halo occupation distribution model that incorporates assembly bias. We analyze scales down to $0.4 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}$ for clustering and $2.5 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}$ for lensing, leading to stringent constraints on $S_8 = \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_\mathrm{m} / 0.3}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ when fixing other cosmological parameters to those preferred by the CMB. We find $S_8 = 0.794 \pm 0.023$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m} = 0.295 \pm 0.012$ when using lensing measurements from DES and KiDS. Similarly, for HSC, we find $S_8 = 0.793 \pm 0.017$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{m} = 0.303 \pm 0.010$ when assuming the best-fit photometric redshift offset suggested by the HSC collaboration. Overall, our results are in good agreement with other results in the literature while continuing to highlight the constraining power of non-linear scales.

 - **Abstract**
 We estimate the source redshift distribution of current weak lensing surveys by applying the clustering-based redshift calibration technique, using the galaxy redshift sample provided by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1). We cross-correlate the Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS), Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) from DESI, within the redshift range $0.1 < z < 1.6$, with overlapping tomographic source samples from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), and Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. Using realistic mock catalogues, we test the stability of the clustering-redshift signal to fitting scale, reference-sample choice, and the evolution of source galaxy bias, and we explicitly model and marginalise over magnification contributions, which become non-negligible at $z \gtrsim 1$ due to the depth of the DESI ELG sample. We then compare the resulting bias-weighted redshift distributions to those calibrated using self-organising map (SOM) techniques, finding agreement within uncertainties for all surveys and tomographic bins. Our results demonstrate that clustering redshifts enabled by DESI's unprecedented spectroscopic sample provides a robust, complementary, and independent constraint capable of reducing one of the dominant systematic uncertainties in weak lensing cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate redshift estimates are a critical requirement for weak lensing surveys and one of the main uncertainties in constraints on dark energy and large-scale cosmic structure. In this paper, we study the potential to calibrate photometric redshift (photo-z) distributions for gravitational lensing using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Since beginning its science operations in 2021, DESI has collected more than 50 million redshifts, adding about one million monthly. In addition to its large-scale structure samples, DESI has also acquired over 256k high-quality spectroscopic redshifts (spec-zs) in the COSMOS and XMM and VVDS fields. This is already a factor of 3 larger than previous spec-z calibration compilations in these two regions. Here, we explore calibrating photo-zs for the subset of KiDS-1000 galaxies that fall into joint self-organizing map (SOM) cells overlapping the DESI COSMOS footprint using the DESI COSMOS observations. Estimating the redshift distribution in KiDS-1000 with the new DESI data, we find broad consistency with previously published results while also detecting differences in the mean redshift in some tomographic bins with an average shifts of Delta Mean(z) = -0.028 in the mean and Delta Median(z) = +0.011 in the median across tomographic bins. However, we also find that incompleteness per SOM cell, i.e., groups of galaxies with similar colors and magnitudes, can modify n(z) distributions. Finally, we comment on the fact that larger photometric catalogs, aligned with the DESI COSMOS and DESI XMM and VVDS footprints, would be needed to fully exploit the DESI dataset and would extend the coverage to nearly eight times the area of existing 9-band photometry.

 - **Abstract**
 Because of their extreme stellar densities, globular clusters are highly efficient factories of X-ray binaries and radio pulsars: per unit of stellar mass, they contain about 1000 times more of these exotic objects. Thus far, 345 radio pulsars have been found in globular clusters. These can be used as precision probes of the structure, gas content, magnetic field, and dynamic history of their host clusters; some of them are also highly interesting in their own right because they probe exotic stellar evolution scenarios as well as the physics of dense matter, accretion, and gravity; one of them (PSR~J0514$-$4002E) might even be the first pulsar - black hole system known. Deep searches with SKA-MID and SKA-LOW will only require one to a few tied-array beams, and can be done during early commissioning of the telescope, before an all-sky pulsar survey using hundreds to thousands of tied-array beams is feasible. Even a conservative approach predicts new discoveries only with the core of SKA-MID AA*, and the full AA* and eventually AA4 is expected to increase the number of discoveries even more, leading to more than doubling the current known population. This offers a great opportunity for early SKAO pulsar science, even before all the collecting area is in place. On the other hand, a more optimistic prediction calls for a 4-5 times growth of the population, leading to a total of about 1700 pulsars to be detectable with SKA-MID AA4 configuration in all Galactic GCs visible by SKA telescopes. Thus, a dedicated search for pulsars in globular clusters will fully exploit the best possible natural laboratories to study many branches of physics and astrophysics, including properties of dense matter, stellar evolution, and the dynamical history of the Galactic globular cluster systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of a pulsar closely orbiting our Galaxy's supermassive black hole - Sagittarius A* - is one of the ultimate prizes in pulsar astrophysics. The relativistic effects expected in such a system could far exceed those currently observable in compact binaries such as double neutron stars and pulsar white dwarfs. In addition, pulsars offer the opportunity to study the magneto-ionic properties of Earth's nearest galactic nucleus in unprecedented detail. For these reasons, and more, a multitude of pulsar searches of the Galactic Centre have been undertaken, with the outcome of just seven pulsar detections within a projected distance of 100 pc from Sagittarius A*. It is currently understood that a larger underlying population likely exists, but it is not until observations with the SKA have started that this population can be revealed. In this paper, we look at important updates since the publication of the last SKAO science book and offer a focused view of observing strategies and likely outcomes with the updated SKAO design.

 - **Abstract**
 The known population of non-accreting neutron stars is ever growing and currently consists of more than 3500 sources. Pulsar surveys with the SKAO telescopes will greatly increase the known population, adding radio pulsars to every subgroup in the radio-loud neutron star family. These discoveries will not only add to the current understanding of neutron star physics by increasing the sample of sources that can be studied, but will undoubtedly also uncover previously unknown types of sources that will challenge our theories of a wide range of physical phenomena. A broad variety of scientific studies will be made possible by a significantly increased known population of neutron stars, unravelling questions such as: How do isolated pulsars evolve with time; What is the connection between magnetars, high B-field pulsars, and the newly discovered long-period pulsars; How is a pulsar's spin-down related to its radio emission; What is the nuclear equation of state? Increasing the known numbers of pulsars in binary or triple systems may enable both larger numbers and higher precision tests of gravitational theories and general relativity, as well as probing the neutron star mass distribution. The excellent sensitivity of the SKAO telescopes combined with the wide field of view, large numbers of simultaneous tied-array beams that will be searched in real time, wide range of observing frequencies, and the ability to form multiple sub-arrays will make the SKAO an excellent facility to undertake a wide range of neutron star research. In this paper, we give an overview of different types of neutron stars and discuss how the SKAO telescopes will aid in our understanding of the neutron star population.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary (and trinary) radio pulsars are natural laboratories in space for understanding gravity in the strong field regime, with many unique and precise tests carried out so far, including the most precise tests of the strong equivalence principle and of the radiative properties of gravity. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope, with its high sensitivity in the Southern Hemisphere, will vastly improve the timing precision of recycled pulsars, allowing for a deeper search of potential deviations from general relativity (GR) in currently known systems. A Galactic census of pulsars will, in addition, will yield the discovery of dozens of relativistic pulsar systems, including potentially pulsar -- black hole binaries, which can be used to test the cosmic censorship hypothesis and the ``no-hair'' theorem. Aspects of gravitation to be explored include tests of strong equivalence principles, gravitational dipole radiation, extra field components of gravitation, gravitomagnetism, and spacetime symmetries. In this chapter, we describe the kinds of gravity tests possible with binary pulsar and outline the features and abilities that SKA must possess to best contribute to this science.

 - **Abstract**
 Matter inside neutron stars is compressed to densities several times greater than nuclear saturation density, while maintaining low temperatures and large asymmetries between neutrons and protons. Neutron stars, therefore, provide a unique laboratory for testing physics in environments that cannot be recreated on Earth. To uncover the highly uncertain nature of cold, ultra-dense matter, discovering and monitoring pulsars is essential, and the SKA will play a crucial role in this endeavour. In this paper, we will present the current state-of-the-art in dense matter physics and dense matter superfluidity, and discuss recent advances in measuring global neutron star properties (masses, moments of inertia, and maximum rotation frequencies) as well as non-global observables (pulsar glitches and free precession). We will specifically highlight how radio observations of isolated neutron stars and those in binaries -- such as those performed with the SKA in the near future -- inform our understanding of ultra-dense physics and address in detail how SKAO's telescopes unprecedented sensitivity, large-scale survey and sub-arraying capabilities will enable novel dense matter constraints. We will also address the potential impact of dark matter and modified gravity models on these constraints and emphasise the role of synergies between the SKA and other facilities, specifically X-ray telescopes and next-generation gravitational wave observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has uncovered a substantial population of Massive ($M_{\star} \gtrsim 10^{10 }\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$), Quenched Galaxies (MQGs) in the early Universe ($z \gtrsim 2$), whose properties challenge current galaxy formation models. In this paper, we examine this population of MQGs within the new COLIBRE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We report number densities and stellar mass functions in broad agreement with the latest observations. The predicted quenching and formation timescales are qualitatively consistent with observational inferences. Leveraging the state-of-the-art physics in COLIBRE, the model predicts that MQGs have dust and $\rm H_{2}$ fractions more than $1$ dex lower than their massive star-forming counterparts; while their sizes and kinematics remain broadly similar. We further explore the processes driving galaxies to become massive and quenched in COLIBRE, identifying active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback as the primary quenching mechanism. Compared to star-forming galaxies of similar mass, MQGs host more massive black holes (BHs) and exhibit higher star formation efficiencies. These differences arise from their environments, particularly at local ($\rm 0.3\,cMpc$) to intermediate scales ($\rm 1.0\,cMpc$) before quenching, where overdense regions are associated with enhanced gas inflows, higher BH accretion and, hence, feedback power. We find that about $55\%$ of MQGs survive as the main progenitors of $z=0$ galaxies when they are selected at $z=3$, although up to $55\%$ experience rejuvenation episodes. Our results provide robust predictions for MQGs, show that tensions with observations are reduced when an effective observational uncertainty is forward-modelled, and clarify the mechanisms behind their origin.

#### Astrophysical Implications of Eccentricity in Gravitational Waves from Neutron Star-Black Hole Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational-wave signal from the neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger GW200105 is consistent with this binary having significant orbital eccentricity close to merger. This raises the question of how an eccentric NSBH might form. Compact object binaries that form via isolated binary star evolution should radiate away any orbital eccentricity long before their gravitational-wave signal enters the sensitive frequency range of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network. Meanwhile, dynamical environments -- which can be conducive to mergers on eccentric orbits -- produce very few NSBHs. We estimate the minimum measurable eccentricity of NSBHs at 10 Hz orbit-averaged gravitational-wave frequency, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$, finding that for GW200105, GW200115, and GW230529-like systems, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$ is O(0.01). For a GW190814-like unequal-mass binary with significant higher-order mode content, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}=0.003$; this is an order of magnitude lower than when higher-order modes are not present. For dominant-mode signals from eccentric binaries with $m_2=1.5$ M$_\odot$ and a range of total masses from $3\,{\rm M_\odot} \leq M \leq50\,\rm M_\odot$, we find $0.008\leq e_{\mathrm{min},10}\leq0.022$. The relationship between $M$ and $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$ is linear when the binaries are non-spinning. When the binaries are maximally spin-precessing, $e_{\mathrm{min},10}$ decreases as mass ratio becomes more unequal. We estimate the sensitivity of a quasi-circular templated search to a population of NSBHs from field triples, finding that we recover only 27% of our simulated population. Finally, we show that if ~1/3 of present NSBH detections are measurably eccentric, then all of them are consistent with an isolated field triple origin.

#### The dominant role of dark matter halo in quenching central galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the quenching of star formation in central galaxies remains a core challenge in galaxy evolution. Two decades ago, the concept of halo quenching was introduced as a dominant mechanism, positing that massive central galaxy quenching is governed by the thermodynamics of gas predominantly influenced by dark matter halos. However, a vastly increasing body of observational evidence consistently indicates that quenching correlates predominantly with central properties like velocity dispersion, bulge mass, and black hole mass. When these properties are controlled, halo mass appears to show weak influence, supporting AGN feedback as the primary mechanism. A recurring key issue, however, is that these studies rely on halo masses derived via abundance matching (AM). Direct observational measurements from weak lensing, satellite kinematics, and galactic dynamics reveal that AM systematically overestimates halo masses of star-forming centrals while underestimating those of passive ones. To accurately assess the true role of halo mass. we re-estimated halo masses for SDSS groups; the resulting halo mass function and stellar-to-halo mass relations (SHMRs) for both populations match theoretical predictions and weak lensing measurements. Using these improved masses, we find direct observational evidence that halo mass is the dominant factor in quenching central galaxies, with a clear threshold at $M_{h}\sim 10^{12.1}M_\odot; $. By applying a simple correction to AM data using weak lensing-derived SHMRs, we demonstrate that previous claims regarding the dominance of central properties stem primarily from systematic biases in AM halo masses. Our results suggest that the significance of AGN feedback is primarily manifested in halos above this mass threshold, in galaxies already primed for quenching. In other words, AGN feedback appears to become effective in halos above this mass threshold.

 - **Abstract**
 The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) that will be carried out by the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory promises to be the defining survey of the next decade, supplying unprecedented access to the night sky to static science- and time-domain science-focused researchers alike. Maximizing the output of the broad remit of Rubin Observatory science requires a non-trivial survey strategy. For time-domain science, the most promising strategy designed so far is a rolling survey strategy, whereby a subset of the full LSST survey area is observed at higher rate compared with the nominal rate dictated by weather conditions and the observatory's technical constraints. This strategy is now the baseline approach for the LSST as a whole. Focusing on static science (galaxy clustering and weak lensing), we study how these time-domain-optimized rolling strategies affect the depth uniformity at intermediate years of the survey. We characterize the amount of survey area at high risk of being lost in static-science analyses of a baseline rolling LSST dataset due to an insufficient combination of survey contiguity and uniformity. At intermediate data releases, nearly half of the survey could be lost for static science, decreasing the Dark Energy figure of merit by approximately 40\%. We describe additional metrics focused on key analysis tasks, such as photometric redshifts and galaxy clustering. We propose a new strategy that returns the survey to uniformity at key release years, enabling use of the full survey area and restoring our metrics to the values they would have in a non-rolling cadence without loss of time domain data relative to a rolling survey with the same number of rolling cycles. This work has informed the third round of optimization of the survey strategy, and the new uniform rolling strategies have been incorporated into the baseline strategy.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a perturbation-level modification of symmetric teleparallel gravity of the form $f(Q)=F(Q)+M\sqrt{Q}$ and assess its ability to ease the $\sigma_8$ tension. The square-root term leaves the background expansion unchanged while modifying the effective gravitational coupling, providing a pure decoupling between background cosmology and structure-growth evolution. Using the latest redshift-space distortion data, including DESI DR2 Full-Shape measurements, we constrain $M$ and $\sigma_8$ across three representative backgrounds: $\Lambda$CDM, an $H_0$-tension-reducing model, and a DESI-motivated dynamical dark energy scenario. In all cases, the square-root correction suppresses growth and can reconcile $\sigma_8$ with Planck at the $1\sigma$ level, with the strongest improvement occurring in the $H_0$-tension-oriented background. A residual degeneracy between $M$ and $\sigma_8$ remains, indicating that future multi-probe analyses combining lensing and full-shape clustering will be required to determine whether the $\sqrt{Q}$ term represents a genuine signal of modified gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when a star crosses the tidal radius of a black hole (BH) and is ripped apart, providing a novel and powerful way to probe dormant BHs over a wide mass range. In this study, we present our late-time observations and comprehensive multi-wavelength analyses of an extraordinary TDE at the center of a dwarf galaxy, which exhibited successive flares in the optical, X-ray, and radio bands. Notably, we discovered an unexpected high-state X-ray plateau phase following the peak until the present time. Along with its reported prolonged rise lasting at least 550 days, these unique characteristics are consistent with the scenario of a TDE caused by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of approximately $(1-6) \times 10^5$ solar masses. Furthermore, scaling relations derived from the host-galaxy properties indicated a similar BH mass in concert. This discovery highlights the invaluable role of TDEs in the search for elusive IMBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 Our study shows that the more a dark energy model allows the equation of state to become phantom-like toward the past, the better it fits current observations which also may lead to stronger statistical tension with $\Lambda$CDM. In particular, models with greater flexibility in their redshift evolution, such as power-law type forms, are mildly preferred over more restrictive parametrizations with similar parameter dimensionality. For the dataset including DESY5, the deviation from $\Lambda$CDM reaches a significance of $6.26\sigma$. These results indicate that present data are sensitive to enhanced phantom behaviour and provide clear guidance for constructing phenomenologically viable dark energy parametrizations.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological measurements are hinting that dark energy may evolve, with its equation of state, $w_\mathrm{DE}$, even showing oscillatory patterns. In this work, we employ a model-independent approach to jointly reconstruct $w_\mathrm{DE}$ and the sum of neutrino masses, $\sum m_\nu$, adopting the PCHIP method with seven fixed nodes in which we allow the two parameters to vary. We employ CMB, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Supernovae Ia data to constrain the values of $w_\mathrm{DE}$ and $\sum m_\nu$ at each node. We conduct three different analyses in which we reconstruct $w_\mathrm{DE}$: one with fixed $\sum m_\nu=0.06~\mathrm{eV}$; one in which we allow $\sum m_\nu$ to vary, and one in which we also reconstruct $\sum m_\nu$ using the PCHIP method. We find the dark energy equation of state to be consistent with the cosmological constant scenario, except when including DESI data and allowing for phantom crossing, where we find a $95\%$ CL deviation from $w_\mathrm{DE}=-1$ around $z\sim1.2$. For neutrino masses, we obtain looser constraints when focusing on phantom dark energy, that show further early and late relaxation when reconstructing the mass via the PCHIP method.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that atomic clock measurements provides an exceptionally sensitive Solar System probe of scalar tensor dark energy. By connecting variations in Newton's constant and differential clock drifts to the dynamics of a single dark energy scalar, we derive a direct constraint on the present day equation of state and our results force any locally coupled scalar dark energy into a very slowly rolling regime, giving the strongest bounds on the equation of state parameter. This is independent of potential shape or kinetic structure and rules out broad classes of canonical and non canonical models, leaving only near Lambda CDM behavior or fully decoupled fields as viable late time scalar dark energy, thereby leaving cosmological constant and minimally coupled scalar field models as the most consistent dark energy regimes. We also use results from Lunar Laser Ranging and photon trajectories to further strengthen our the depth of our constraints.

 - **Abstract**
 Dual active galactic nuclei (DAGN) mark an observable stage of massive black hole (MBH) pairing in galaxy mergers and are precursors to the MBH binaries that generate low-frequency gravitational waves. Using the large-volume ASTRID cosmological simulation, we construct DAGN catalogs matched to current (COSMOS-Web, DESI) and forthcoming (AXIS, Roman) searches. With realistic selection functions applied, ASTRID reproduces observed dual fractions, separations, and host-galaxy properties across redshifts. We predict a substantial population of small-separation (<5 kpc) duals that current surveys fail to capture, indicating that the apparent paucity of sub-kpc systems in COSMOS-Web is driven primarily by selection effects rather than a physical deficit. By following each simulated dual forward in time, we show that dual AGN are robust tracers of MBH mergers: ~30-70% coalesce within $\lesssim 1$ Gyr, and 20-60% of these mergers produce gravitational-wave signals detectable by LISA. Duals accessible to AXIS and Roman are the progenitors of ~10% of low-redshift LISA events and ~30% of the PTA-band stochastic background. Massive green-valley galaxies with moderate-luminosity AGN, together with massive star-forming hosts containing bright quasars at $z>1$, emerge as the most likely environments for imminent MBH binaries. These results provide a unified cosmological framework linking dual AGN demographics, MBH binary formation, and gravitational-wave emission, and they identify concrete, high-priority targets for coordinated electromagnetic and GW searches in upcoming multi-messenger surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 Interpreting multi-messenger signals from neutron stars and black holes requires reliable general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations across rapidly evolving high-performance-computing platforms, yet key algorithms are routinely rewritten within infrastructure-specific numerical-relativity codes, hindering verification and reuse. We present the General Relativistic Hydrodynamics Library (GRHayL), a modular, infrastructure-agnostic GR(M)HD library providing conservative-to-primitive recovery, reconstruction, flux/source and induction operators, equations of state, and neutrino leakage through an intuitive interface. GRHayL refactors and extends the mature IllinoisGRMHD code into reusable pointwise and stencil-wise kernels, enabling rapid development and cross-code validation in diverse frameworks, while easing adoption of new microphysics and future accelerators. We implement the same kernels in the Einstein Toolkit (Carpet and CarpetX) and BlackHoles@Home, demonstrating portability with minimal duplication. Validation combines continuous-integration unit tests with cross-infrastructure comparisons of analytic GRMHD Riemann problems, dynamical Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff evolutions, and binary neutron-star mergers, showing comparable or improved behavior over legacy IllinoisGRMHD and established Einstein Toolkit codes.

#### Particle Production by Time-Varying Dark Energy and the End of Cosmic Expansion

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15860

 - **Abstract**
 We consider various possible consequences of time-varying dark energy due to a quintessence scalar field whose energy density is partially converted to particles as the field evolves down its potential. This particle production acts as a source of thermal friction on the field that can make it difficult to distinguish whether dark energy is due to a radiating field rolling down a steep potential, a purely self-interacting field moving down a flatter potential, or a cosmological constant. By reducing the acceleration of the scalar field, thermal friction increases the amount of accelerated expansion and can cause a sizable bump in the quintessence equation of state. We take special interest in the case where a steep potential rapidly changes from positive to negative as the field evolves, resulting in the end of cosmic expansion and the beginning of contraction. Even in this case, we find that thermal friction lengthens the period of accelerated expansion and consequently delays the end of cosmic expansion, making it challenging to detect the impending transition to contraction using conventional cosmological tests. However, particle production can also provide alternative avenues for detection by generating a background of thermal dark radiation, partly comprised of neutrinos or other particles, whose energy density exceeds the remnant photon energy density.

 - **Abstract**
 It was recently shown that, in a binary coalescence, the greybody factor of the remnant black hole modulates the post-merger ringdown signal. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple four-parameter model based on the greybody factor accurately reproduces the frequency-domain amplitude of a large set of comparable-mass, aligned-spin numerical relativity waveforms from the SXS catalog, achieving mismatches of order ${\cal O}(10^{-5})$ and improving existing models by roughly two orders of magnitude. We also identify the optimal initial frequency for applying the model in the frequency domain and provide analytical fits of the model parameters in terms of the progenitor masses and aligned spins. Our results pave the way for new consistency tests of the ringdown phase, complementary to traditional black hole spectroscopy.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive scalar fields on black hole backgrounds generally admit two families of modes: quasi-bound states (QBS) and quasinormal modes (QNM). We demonstrate the orthogonality between the two mode families with respect to a relativistic product. We also find that, although the two families appear on different Riemann sheets of the Green's function of massive scalar perturbations, they can be brought to a single sheet with an appropriate redefinition of the frequency variable. In this variable, it is more natural to see how both mode families can be excited by initial data, and to approximate the Green's function with saddle points. Finally, we investigate the QNM emission from boson clouds - the latter effectively consisting of a single QBS - driven by the tidal perturbation of a second compact object. We show that while the resonant emission of QNMs is generally suppressed, QNM transitions may be more prominent when the interaction with the perturber is non-resonant, such as in the dynamical capture of unbound objects, and when the perturber transits close to the light ring.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed geometric analysis of adiabatic, anisotropic gravitational collapse formulated in a single Painlevé-Gullstrand coordinate system that covers both the interior and exterior, thereby eliminating cross-chart matching artifacts. Building on the Oppenheimer-Snyder framework with a phenomenologically motivated energy-density profile, we enforce the Israel junction conditions and obtain closed-form surface evolution. Within this unified chart we derive exact solutions for the complete collapse process, characterize the causal structure, and track horizon formation and evolution. In particular, we identify and analyse a double apparent-horizon phase inside the matter and show that the event horizon stabilizes at the Schwarzschild radius. We further obtain critical parameter relations that govern the dynamics, including a threshold linking initial compactness to immediate horizon formation. The model is geometrically self-consistent within Einstein's equations but exhibits violations of the standard point-wise energy conditions, highlighting known limitations of idealized anisotropic matter models and delineating the boundary where classical descriptions become inadequate. Together, these results provide geometric insights, compact analytic benchmarks and a didactic, coordinate-uniform perspective on collapse and horizon dynamics.

Using a spherically symmetric Painlevé-Gullstrand-like metric with unit lapse and a radial shift function, we develop piecewise-defined solutions where the interior geometry is flat and the exterior is supported by several sources inspired by electromagnetic distributions. These include point-charge-like fields, Yukawa-screened electric fields, dielectric layers, and Hulthén-type field. The Einstein equations naturally impose a relation between the energy density and radial pressure, while the tangential pressure is derived from the metric. We systematically evaluate the classical energy conditions in each model and study the appearance of singular behavior using Israel junction conditions. This framework offers an analytically tractable setting to explore the gravitational effects of physically simple, well-understood sources without resorting to exotic matter.

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) with matter is normally treated as being insignificant. However, recent work has shown that the interaction with a viscous fluid may be astrophysically important when the distance between the matter and GW source is somewhat smaller than the GW wavelength. Previous work has mainly considered perturbations on a Minkowski background, and here these results are extended to the case that the background is a general, non-vacuum, static, spherically symmetric spacetime. Expressions are obtained for GW damping and the consequent heating of the fluid, and implemented in computer code. The results are applied to astrophysical scenarios: Core collapse supernovae, the post-merger signal from a binary neutron star merger, and matter accreting at a binary black hole merger. It is found that, compared to the Minkowski case, the damping and heating effects increase, in some cases by several orders of magnitude. It is possible for a GW signal to be completely damped, and for the heating to be such that a gamma-ray burst occurs.

 - **Abstract**
 This work investigates the impact of streams of transient, non-Gaussian noise artifacts or "glitches" on the parameter estimation of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRI) in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Glitches cause biased and less precise inference for short-duration signals such as massive black hole binaries, but their effect on long-lived sources such as EMRIs has not been quantified. Using simulated LISA observations containing injected EMRIs and streams of shapelet-based glitches drawn from the LISA Pathfinder catalog, we estimate the glitch-induced parameter biases and uncertainties through a Fisher-matrix-based analysis whose accuracy we verify with Markov-Chain Monte Carlo. We find that moderately mitigated glitch streams i.e. ones containing only glitches of up to moderate SNRs ($\rho \lesssim 90$) induce negligible to minor biases $[\sim0.04\sigma ,\sim0.6\sigma]$ in the inferred EMRI parameters. In contrast, weakly mitigated glitch streams containing higher-SNR events ($\rho \lesssim 400$) can produce biases nearing $1\sigma$. These results demonstrate that, when compared to inference of other sources such as massive black hole binaries, EMRI inference is notably more robust to glitches. We stress that at least some amount of glitch modeling and mitigation remains essential for unbiased EMRI analyses in the LISA era.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the motion of an electron constrained to follow a magnetic field line near a primordial sub-stellar mass black hole. Earlier studies treated the problem in flat (Minkowski) spacetime, yielding qualitatively correct results and introducing a light cylinder (LC), a hypothetical surface where the linear velocity of rotation equals the speed of light. However, this picture changes significantly when gravity is included. By analyzing the electron's dynamics in the Schwarzschild metric, we obtain a modified light cylinder (MLC) whose geometry no longer resembles a cylinder. We then determine the maximum energies attainable by the electrons under the limiting effects of inverse Compton scattering, curvature radiation, and synchrotron radiation.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves can be gravitationally lensed by massive objects along their path. Depending on the lens mass and the lens-source geometry, this can lead to the observation of a single distorted signal or multiple repeated events with the same frequency evolution. We present the results for gravitational-wave lensing searches on the data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O4a). We search for strongly lensed events in the newly acquired data by (1) searching for an overall phase shift present in an image formed at a saddle point of the lens potential, (2) looking for pairs of detected candidates with consistent frequency evolution, and (3) identifying sub-threshold counterpart candidates to the detected signals. Beyond strong lensing, we also look for lensing-induced distortions in all detected signals using an isolated point-mass model. We do not find evidence for strongly lensed gravitational-wave signals and use this result to constrain the rate of detectable strongly lensed events and the merger rate density of binary black holes at high redshift. In the search for single distorted lensed signals, we find one outlier: GW231123_135430, for which we report more detailed investigations. While this event is interesting, the associated waveform uncertainties make its interpretation complicated, and future observations of the populations of binary black holes and of gravitational lenses will help determine the probability that this event could be lensed.

 - **Abstract**
 Total transmission modes (TTMs) are modes with complex frequencies that propagate across a black hole spacetime without reflection. Recently, it is found that suitably tailored time-dependent scattering can excite these complex modes and suppress the reflected signal for the entire duration of the process, a phenomenon referred to as virtual absorption. Motivated by this, we present the study of the spectrum stability of TTMs using pseudospectrum and condition numbers. We focus on perturbations of $d$-dimensional Tangherlini black holes and recast the TTM problem as a generalized eigenvalue problem by utilizing the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. The results show that TTMs are generically spectrally unstable, with sensitivity increasing for higher overtones, in close analogy with quasinormal modes. A notable exception is a purely imaginary TTM whose pseudospectrum's contours are nearly concentric and whose condition number is orders of magnitude smaller than that of the overtones, indicating enhanced spectral stability. Additionally, we confirm that purely imaginary TTMs occur only for spin $s=2$, whereas genuinely complex TTM families appear only in sufficiently high dimensions, $d \geqslant 8$, extending earlier claims that placed the onset at $d \geqslant 10$.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have revealed synchronized multivalued behavior in thermodynamic, dynamical, and geometric quantities during the black hole first-order phase transition, which enables a diagnosis from different perspectives, yet its fundamental origin has remained poorly understood. By constructing a unified geometric framework integrating real analysis and covering space theory, we reveal the universal mathematical mechanism behind this phenomenon. We prove that this multivaluedness originates from two non-degenerate critical points in the temperature function $T(r_+)$, where $r_+$ is the horizon radius, which fold the parameter space into a three-sheeted covering structure. As a direct application, we propose that a black hole undergoes a first-order phase transition if and only if its $T(r_+)$ curve has two extrema. Accordingly, we establish a classification scheme, denoted $A1$, $A2$, and $B$ for black holes. This scheme offers a complementary perspective to classifications based on global topological invariants. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for diagnosing phase transitions via multivaluedness and establishes a unified geometric perspective on black hole thermodynamics, chaotic dynamics, and spacetime structure during first-order phase transitions.

 - **Abstract**
 A mathematical model for description of the viscous fingering induced by a chemical reaction is under study. This complicated five-component model is reduced to a three-component diffusive Lotka-Volterra system with convection by introducing a stream function. The system obtained is examined by the classical Lie method. A complete Lie symmetry classification is derived via a rigorous algorithm. In particular, it is proved that the widest Lie algebras of invariance occur when the stream function generate a linear velocity field. The most interesting cases (from the symmetry and applicability point of view) are further studied in order to derive exact solutions. A wide range of exact solutions are constructed for radially-symmetric stream functions. These solutions include time-dependent and radially symmetric solutions as well as more complicated solutions expressed in terms of the Weierstrass function. It was shown that some of exact solutions can be used for demonstration of spatiotemporal evolution of concentrations corresponding to two reactants and their product.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a new way to produce infinite families of bases of a quantum system's Hilbert space, as well as methods to find its dimension. These families are constructed via Brownian motions in the Hilbert space, defined using disordered, time-dependent couplings. The dimension spanned by them has zero variance over the ensemble of disordered couplings, and it is determined by certain replica partition functions. We apply these methods to finite dimensional $q$-local systems (spin clusters and SYK) and black holes. For $q$-local systems we find exact expressions at finite $q$, $N$, and $t$, for replica partition functions, together with universal behavior at large times and a semiclassical analysis at large-$N$ in appropriate master field variables. The right Hilbert space dimension is obtained for any time $t>0$, $q>1$ and $N>0$. For black holes, the Brownian motions prepare quantitatively generic ensembles of black hole microstates, and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is universally reproduced by counting those. There the $n$-replica partition functions are constructed by gluing $n$-traversable womrholes at their future and past. This method demonstrates the robustness of black hole microstate counting methods, avoiding several limitations of previous constructions, including the non-genericity of the microstates and associated interiors, implicit statistics of heavy operators, limited microscopic control over overlaps, and the need for specific limits in the calculation.

 - **Abstract**
 We study some implications of $SU(N)\times U(1)$ theories coupled to gravity in the large-$N$ limit. We find that in theories with quarks transforming as $q\sim (\mathbf{N},1)$, black holes (BH) with charge larger than a critical value approach extremality $(M_{\rm BH}=\sqrt{2} M_{\rm Pl} Q_{\rm BH})$ as they evaporate. This occurs because BHs in this theory can only lose charge by emitting baryons, a process suppressed by a combinatoric factor $e^{-N\log N}$. Once extremality is reached the BH evolution halts for exponentially long times, $\tau_{\rm BH}\gtrsim e^{N\log N}$, without being protected by any symmetry. At times $t\gg\tau_{\rm BH}$ the BH forms a cloud of deconfined quarks around it, a \textit{quark corona}. The quarks are connected to the horizon by strings extending throughout distances that can be much larger than the inverse of the confinement scale, $\Lambda_N^{-1}$. Strikingly, due to energy conservation, these long strings cannot break even for light quarks. These effects can be further enhanced in clockwork-like theories based on Yang-Mills sectors of the type, $SU(N_1)\times SU(N_2)\times ...\times U(1)$. As an application to phenomenology, we give examples where BHs as light as one gram survive until today without evaporating, opening up regions of parameter space for primordial BH dark matter previously excluded by Hawking evaporation. This result relies only on large-$N$ combinatorics and is independent of the radiation mechanism from the BH, particle masses, and confinement scale. The theories we discuss pass non-trivial tests imposed by Swampland conjectures, including completeness of the spectrum as well as the weak gravity conjecture.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive the shockwave metric in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell effective field theory (EFT) by performing an ultra-relativistic boost of the charged black hole solution accompanied by a rescaling of its mass and charge, including leading order EFT corrections. In contrast to the neutral (Schwarzschild) case, where higher derivative operators leave the shockwave geometry unchanged, we show that electrically charged shockwaves receive nontrivial EFT corrections. We then compute the time delay experienced by a probe photon traversing the resulting charged shockwave. We find that two EFT contributions, the correction to the shockwave geometry and the backreaction induced by the probe photon, are both essential for obtaining a physical time delay that is invariant under field redefinitions of the metric.

 - **Abstract**
 The aim of this Thesis is twofold. On the one hand, we find the necessary and sufficient conditions for a maximally supersymmetric supergravity theory in 3D to be a solution of 11D supergravity (but the result is general and also holds for 10D supergravities), with 8 dimensions compactified into a coset space. The used method is based on the formalism of generalised geometry, useful for the study of dualities in string theory and supergravity. The analysis extends the known results to the case in which the duality group of the reduced theory is $E_{8(8)}$, whose generalised geometry is still little understood. On the other hand, we study properties of the so-called covariant fracton gauge theory, computing the BRST cohomology and consistent anomalies, and showing that its solutions describe a specific subsector of an extension of General Relativity, called Moller-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory. Covariant fracton theory is the gauge theory of a symmetric rank-2 tensor, invariant under gauge transformations depending on the second derivative of a scalar parameter, and is the Lorentz-covariant extension of the continuous limit of spin-chain theories admitting excitations with reduced mobility (called fractons), due to the conservation of the dipole moment. In both cases, the Weitzenböck torsion plays a crucial rôle. The Thesis includes a self-contained review of the main notions needed to understand the original results, comprising, in addition to the already mentioned topics, duality in supergravity theories, the generalised Lie derivative, formulation of eleven-dimensional supergravity suitable to reductions with duality groups given by exceptional Lie groups, salient aspects of three-dimensional gravity, and the BRST formalism for computing anomalies in field theories.

 - **Abstract**
 Semiclassical black hole emission in four spacetime dimensions is studied using a non-local effective action. The field equations that determine the time-dependent renormalized stress tensor are solved numerically for a black hole formed by an ingoing null shock wave, and otherwise smooth initial data. We find that Hawking radiation is generated dynamically near the black hole horizon and freely propagates out to null infinity, resulting in an outgoing energy flux that builds up from zero at early retarded times before the black hole forms. This resolves the long-standing issue of pre-Hawking radiation, suffered by calculations based on a static approximation to the stress tensor in an Unruh state, and paves the way towards four-dimensional black hole evolution with semiclassical back-reaction included.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider four-dimensional general relativity with a positive cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, in the presence of a boundary, $\Gamma$, of finite spatial size. The boundary is located near a cosmological event horizon, and is subject to boundary conditions that fix the conformal class of the induced metric, and, $K$, the trace of the extrinsic curvature along $\Gamma$. The proximity of $\Gamma$ to the horizon is controlled by the dimensionless parameter ${K}{{\Lambda}^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$. We provide an exhaustive analysis of linearised gravitational perturbations for the setup. This is performed both for a $\Gamma$ encasing a portion of the static patch that ends just before the cosmological horizon (pole patch), as well as a $\Gamma$ containing only the region near the cosmological horizon (cosmic patch). In the pole patch, we uncover a layered hierarchy of modes: ordinary normal modes, a novel type of boundary gapless mode, and boundary soft modes of frequency $\omega \approx \pm 2\pi i T_{\text{dS}}$, with $T_{\text{dS}}$ the horizon temperature. Minkowskian behaviour is recovered only for angular momenta $l \gtrsim {K}{{\Lambda}^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$ which can be made parametrically large, thus attenuating previously found growing modes. In the cosmic patch, we uncover sound and shear fluid-dynamical modes that we interpret in terms of a conformal fluid with shear viscosity over entropy density ratio $\tfrac{\eta}{s} = \tfrac{1}{4\pi}$ and vanishing bulk viscosity $\zeta=0$. The fluid dynamical sector is shown to admit a non-linear treatment. We describe a scaling regime in which the stretched horizon gravitational dynamics is dictated by a universal Rindler geometry, independent to the details of the infilling horizon. We briefly discuss quantitative features that distinguish cosmological and black hole horizons away from the Rindler regime.
