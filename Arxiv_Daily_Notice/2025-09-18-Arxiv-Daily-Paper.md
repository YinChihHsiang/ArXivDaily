#### Primordial black holes in Randall-Sundrum: Cosmological signatures

 - **Abstract**
 We reconsider primordial black hole physics in Randall-Sundrum Type-II universes, focusing on constraints from cosmological and astrophysical observables. We pay particular attention to scenarios that allow the entirety of dark matter to be in the form of higher-dimensional primordial black holes. This is possible for a range of AdS radii and black hole masses. Observable constraints are generally modified due to the changes in the higher-dimensional gravitational sector, and come from low-energy $e^{\pm}$ emission, microlensing, and possibly from contributions to unresolved radiation backgrounds. We discuss constraints from the cosmic microwave background due to injection of Hawking quanta into the intergalactic medium. Finally, we comment on recent discussions on the compatibility of higher-dimensional black holes and the KM3-230213A event.

#### The Broadband View of the Bare Seyfert PG 1426+015: Relativistic Reflection, the Soft Excess and the Importance of Oxygen

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from a deep, coordinated $XMM$-$Newton$ + $NuSTAR$ observation of the type 1 Seyfert PG 1426+015, a source of particular interest as the most massive reverberation-mapped black hole to date ($\log [M_{\rm{BH}}/M_{\odot}]$ = $9.01^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$). The high-resolution RGS data confirm the 'bare' nature of the source, showing no evidence for absorption beyond the Galactic column, while the broadband spectrum unambiguously reveals the presence of relativistic reflection from the innermost accretion disc (in the form of a relativistically broadened iron emission and associated Compton reflection hump) as well as confirming the presence of the strong soft excess reported previously. We explore whether relativistic reflection can successfully account for the soft excess along with the higher-energy reflection features, utilizing the two most-commonly used reflection codes (REFLIONX, XILLVER). Ultimately we find that both models are able to successfully reproduce the soft excess, though in the case of the XILLVER model this is contingent on reducing the strength of the O VIII line included in the model, as otherwise this feature prevents the model from reproducing the data. The reflection models that successfully reproduce the broadband data imply a relatively high density for the accretion disc of $\log [n_{\rm{e}} / \rm{cm}^{-3}] \sim 18$, consistent with the loose anti-correlation seen from other AGN in the $\log [n_{\rm{e}} / \rm{cm}^{-3}]$ vs $\log[m_{\rm{BH}} \dot{m}^2]$ plane, as well as a moderate-to-high black hole spin of $a^* \gtrsim 0.7$. This preliminary spin constraint is strongly dependent on the assumption that the soft excess is dominated by relativistic reflection.

 - **Abstract**
 We use high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations to model mechanical and thermal feedback from AGN onto the evolution of Seyfert-type galaxies, studying the morphology of central galaxies growing within dark matter (DM) halos with masses logM/Mo ~11.8 at z=0. In Paper I, we focused on the end products at z=0, here we analyze evolution for z<10. Black holes (SMBHs) of ~10^6 Mo were seeded at z~9.1 and z~3.7, producing jets along their spin axes. Obtained SMBH accretion rates vary in the range ~0.3-10^(-4) of the Eddington rate. We compared the basic properties of galaxies, such as star formation rate, masses, gas and stellar fractions, bulge-to-disk mass ratios, SMBH masses, etc., over the range of redshifts. Our results indicate that jets and associated over-pressured bubbles have substantial effects on Seyfert galaxy evolution, including properties of the interstellar and circumgalactic medium (ISM and CGM), and even beyond. This feedback can suppress and even quench star formation, reduce stellar mass and gas fraction, modify the bulge-to-disk ratios, drive outflows from galaxies and host DM halos, and metal-enrich the CGM. The jets are largely but not exclusively contained within galaxies. However, over-pressured bubbles cross and modify the composition of the CGM and IGM, their thermodynamic and dynamic state, and generate vorticity. The CGM emerges as a complex region, where action of galactic outflows and jet-formed bubbles combines with the influx from cosmological filaments and diffuse accretion. Ultimately, the above processes affect the gas balance within the galaxy, its morphology, and gas supply to the SMBH, limiting its growth.

 - **Abstract**
 The Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is the largest sample to date for small-scale Ly$\alpha$ forest cosmology, accessed through its one-dimensional power spectrum ($P_{\mathrm{1D}}$). The Ly$\alpha$ forest $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ is extracted from quasar spectra that are highly inhomogeneous (both in wavelength and between quasars) in noise properties due to intrinsic properties of the quasar, atmospheric and astrophysical contamination, and also sensitive to low-level details of the spectral extraction pipeline. We employ two estimators in DR1 analysis to measure $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$: the optimal estimator and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) estimator. To ensure robustness of our DR1 measurements, we validate these two power spectrum and covariance matrix estimation methodologies against the challenging aspects of the data. First, using a set of 20 synthetic 1D realizations of DR1, we derive the masking bias corrections needed for the FFT estimator and the continuum fitting bias needed for both estimators. We demonstrate that both estimators, including their covariances, are unbiased with these corrections using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Second, we substantially extend our previous suite of CCD image simulations to include 675,000 quasars, allowing us to accurately quantify the pipeline's performance. This set of simulations reveals biases at the highest $k$ values, corresponding to a resolution error of a few percent. We base the resolution systematics error budget of DR1 $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ on these values, but do not derive corrections from them since the simulation fidelity is insufficient for precise corrections.

#### Cosmic Birefringence from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6

 - **Abstract**
 The polarized light of the cosmic microwave background is sensitive to new physics that violates parity symmetry. For example, the interaction of photons with the fields of elusive dark matter and dark energy could cause a uniform rotation of the plane of linear polarization across the sky, an effect known as cosmic birefringence. We extract the cosmological rotation angle, $\beta$, using Bayesian analysis of parity-violating correlations, $EB$ and $TB$, of polarization data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6. We use prior probabilities for instrumental miscalibration angles derived from the optics model for the ACT telescope and instruments, and marginalize over a residual intensity-to-polarization leakage. We measure $\beta = 0.215^\circ\pm 0.074^\circ$ (68\% confidence level), which excludes $\beta=0$ with a statistical significance of $2.9\sigma$. Although there remain systematics in the ACT data that are not understood and do not allow us to draw strong cosmological conclusions, this result is consistent with previous independent results from the \wmap\ and \planck\ missions. It is suggestive that independent data sets and analyses using different methodologies have yielded the same sign and comparable magnitudes for $\beta$.

#### An updated constraint on the Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy

 - **Abstract**
 The Effective Field Theory of Dark Energy (EFTofDE) provides a systematic and model-independent framework to study dark energy (DE) and modified gravity (MG) with one additional scalar degree of freedom. It can describe the known models such as Quintessence, k-essence, DGP, $f(R)$, and Horndeski theories. In this work, we update constraints on EFTofDE by utilizing the most up-to-date public data including the BAO (DESI DR2), CMB (Planck 2018 \& ACT DR6), SNIa (DESY5), weak lensing (DESY3) and full-shape galaxy power (BOSS DR12). We find with the $\Lambda$CDM background, general relativity (GR) is favored by the data, while with the $w0wa$CDM background, slight modification to GR is favored, but still consistent with GR within $1.5\sigma$. We also find the significance level for dynamical DE is greatly reduced within EFTofDE compared to within GR, indicating the degeneracy between dynamical DE and MG.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first near-infrared interferometric data of a QSO at z=4. The K-band observations were performed with GRAVITY+ on the VLTI using all 4 UTs, detecting a differential phase signal that traces the spatially resolved kinematics for both the H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ lines in the broad line region. We fit the two lines simultaneously with an updated model that includes distinct rotating and conical outflowing components. We find that more than 80\% of the HI line emission from the BLR originates in an outflow with a velocity up to $10^4$ km s$^{-1}$. This is oriented so that our line of sight is along an edge of the conical structure, which produces the prominent blue wing on the line profile. A combination of anisotropic line emission and mid-plane opacity lead to the single-sided phase signal. The model is able to qualitatively match both the outflowing CIV line profile and the systemic OI fluorescent emission. The derived black hole mass of $8\times10^8$ M$_\odot$ is the highest redshift black hole mass measurement to date obtained directly from BLR dynamics. It is an order of magnitude lower than that inferred from various single epoch scaling relations, and implies that the accretion is highly super-Eddington. With reference to recent simulations, the data suggest that this QSO is emitting close to its radiative limit in a regime where strong outflows are expected around a polar conical region.

 - **Abstract**
 Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, binary black hole eccentricity, and provide early warnings for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today's mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10--30Hz band by over 30x, and up to 100x in sub-bands surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future GW observatories, and more broadly instrumentation and control systems.

#### Mass Transport, Turbulent Mixing, and Inflow in Black Hole Accretion

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate mass transport, mixing, and disk evolution in non-radiative black hole accretion flows using Lagrangian tracer particles embedded in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations. Our simulation suite spans magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and standard and normal evolution (SANE) states across a range of black hole spins. By tracking tracer trajectories, we directly measure both advective inflow and stochastic spreading of fluid elements. The tracer distributions are well described by a combination of coherent inward drift and Gaussian-like broadening, consistent with an advection-diffusion picture. MADs exhibit systematically faster inflow than SANEs, with retrograde flows showing the most rapid infall; the innermost stable circular orbit leaves little imprint in MADs but remains more visible in SANEs. Turbulent fluctuations drive strong radial dispersion in all cases, with a superdiffusive scaling of sigma ~ t^0.95 in MADs and sigma ~ t^0.75 in SANEs for high-spin prograde disks. Mixing times decrease toward the event horizon and are consistently shorter in MADs and retrograde configurations. Tracers also reveal how accretion sources shift over time: turbulence draws inflow from a broad range of initial radii, with rapid torus depletion in MADs driving the mean source radius outward as r ~ t^(2/3), while SANEs evolve more gradually with r ~ t^(1/2). We show that the finite mass of the initial torus has a strong influence on late-time behavior, especially in MADs, where imprints of differently sized initial conditions may be accessible as early as t ~ 10000 GM/c^3.

#### Regular black holes with gravitational self-energy as dark matter

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13335

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13335

 - **Abstract**
 We incorporate the effect of non-local gravitational self-energy to obtain a neutral, non-singular spacetime geometry. This is achieved by using a non-local gravitational theory inspired by T-duality, where particle mass is not point-like but smeared over a region. This non-local gravitational self-interaction is derived from the Newtonian gravitational potential and energy density, allowing us to define a coordinate-independent quantity. Thus, we incorporate the non-local gravitational field into the spacetime metric. We demonstrate that the total ADM mass is modified by a finite, regularized gravitational mass term, leading to a regular solution of the Ayon-Beato-Garcia type metric but without electric charge. We show the existence of extremal configurations known as \emph{particle-black hole} objects of order of the Planck mass, which are thermodynamically stable, have a vanishing Hawking temperature and could be a viable dark matter candidate.

#### THE KERR-SEN Solution Satisfying SO(2) Symmetry

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13343

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13343

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new class of KERR-SEN solutions that respect SO(2) symmetry, constructed systematically using the Laurent series expansion method. This approach is based on stationary, axisymmetric Euclidean solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations and incorporates advanced techniques for generating stationary gravitational fields, including the variation-of-constants method and nonlinear superposition. Through this unified framework, we obtain fresh insights into axially symmetric gravitational systems, extend the traditional hierarchy of Kerr-NUT solutions, and bring together several foundational analytic methods under a common structure. The paper offers explicit derivations, supported by numerical simulations, and provides a detailed discussion of the physical consequences, particularly focusing on the roles of dilaton and axion fields. The extended version also includes a comprehensive historical overview of axisymmetric exact solutions, a thorough explanation of the Laurent series formalism in gravitational theory, and an in-depth analysis of the theoretical and astrophysical significance of KERR-SEN metrics in current research.

#### Loop-corrected scalar potentials and late-time acceleration in f(R) gravity

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13373

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13373

 - **Abstract**
 We construct an analytic f(R) gravity model that unifies early-time inflation with late-time cosmic acceleration within a single covariant framework. At high curvature, the model reproduces a Starobinsky-like inflationary plateau, while at low curvature it asymptotes to a stable dark energy-dominated phase. In the scalar-tensor representation, this construction yields a hilltop-type potential in the Jordan frame, which maps to an exponential potential in the Einstein frame. To account for radiative effects, we introduce a logarithmic correction to the Einstein-frame potential inspired by one-loop effective field theory, producing a late-time flattening without requiring fine-tuning. The resulting scalaron dynamics reduce the effective mass to O(H_0), inducing a thawing regime that deviates from a cosmological constant at the sub-percent levels. A joint background likelihood analysis using Pantheon+SH0ES and BAO+CC datasets (within the CPL parametrization) yields H_0 = 73.4+-0.6 km/s/Mpc and Omega_m = 0.253+-0.007, consistent with local expansion rate measurements. The best-fit scalar field parameters are phi_0 \approx 0.027\,M_Pl and lambda \approx 0.010\,M_Pl, corresponding to a present-day dark energy equation of state w_0 \approx -0.985. While compatible with LambdaCDM within current observational bounds, the model satisfies GR recovery at low curvature and exhibits attractor-like behavior, thereby minimizing sensitivity to initial conditions.

#### From de Sitter to Anti-de Sitter singularity regularization: theory and phenomenology

 - **Abstract**
 Recent investigations of vacuum polarization in extremely compact stars suggest that, in such regimes, the effective matter content of spacetime may acquire a vacuum-energy equation of state with negative energy density, mimicking a negative cosmological constant. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a general algorithm to modify well-known spherically symmetric regular black hole metrics by replacing their usual de Sitter cores (dSC) with Anti-de Sitter cores (AdSC). Like their dSC counterparts, these AdSC solutions may exhibit two, one, or no horizons depending on the value of a regularization parameter l. We present explicit examples of AdSC-Bardeen and AdSC-Dymnikova metrics, analyze their main properties, and investigate some of their phenomenological signatures using test fields. In particular, we compare their fundamental quasinormal modes and echo signals with those of the dSC cases, highlighting potential avenues for distinguishing them observationally.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a canonical quantization, the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, of the interior geometry of static and spherically symmetric black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ framework, focusing on Reissner-Nordström. The wave function of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the Reissner-Nordström black hole is set to be on-shell and exhibiting exponential damping away from the classical locus. Horizon boundary conditions for the wave function generate two regimes: a single inward mode from event horizon yields monotonic decay, while superpositions produce either a quantum bounce (single time arrow) or interference-driven annihilation-to-nothing (two time arrows). We show that these are generic features of static black hole interiors. Furthermore, the wave function of the Schwarzschild black hole, obtained as the charge-neutral limit of the Reissner-Nordström black hole, is monotonically decaying and no longer unbounded. Moreover, this framework unifies classical and quantum interiors, suggests a quantum gravitational resolution to the mass inflation, and motivates extensions to Kerr and regular black holes.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13488

 - **Abstract**
 Massive spin-2 fields, which arise in proposed extensions of the standard model of particle physics and general relativity, give rise to a superradiant instability around spinning black holes. We study the nonlinear evolution of this instability in quadratic gravity, where quadratic curvature terms are added to the Einstein-Hilbert action. We find that as the massive spin-2 field grows, the black hole's spin increases, accelerating the growth rate, and eventually leading to a superextremal horizon. This sharply contrasts with the spin-down and eventual saturation that occurs due to the backreaction of the superradiant instability of a minimally coupled massive spin-0 or spin-1 field.

 - **Abstract**
 Traversable wormholes (TWHs) remain one of the most intriguing predictions of General Relativity (GR), offering passage through space-time. However, their existence requires the violation of the null energy condition, making their detection a bit challenging. The essay aims at showing the new avenues probing the observational prospects of TWHs via quasinormal modes and grey body factors, the two fundamental aspects in wave dynamics. The role of QNMs in characterizing the ringdown phase of perturbations and the grey body factors in determining transmission probabilities through wormhole barriers has been investigated. Given their distinct spectral imprints, these features provide a potential means to distinguish wormholes from black holes in gravity wave observations. Advances in high-precision interferometry and multi-messenger astronomy may soon offer crucial insights into the existence of these exotic structures.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a machine learning-based approach for parameter estimation of Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs), leveraging normalizing flows to approximate the likelihood function. By training these flows on simulated data, we can generate posterior samples via Markov Chain Monte Carlo with a relatively reduced computational cost. Our method enables iterative refinement of smaller models targeting specific MBHB events, with significantly fewer waveform template evaluations. However, dimensionality reduction is crucial to make the method computationally feasible: it dictates both the quality and time efficiency of the method. We present initial results for a single MBHB with Gaussian noise and aim to extend our work to increasingly realistic scenarios, including waveforms with higher modes, non-stationary noise, glitches, and data gaps.

#### Blackhole perturbations in the Modified Generalized Chaplygin Gas model

 - **Abstract**
 We study blackhole in the Modified Generalized Chaplygin Gas (MGCG) model, a modified gravity framework proposed to unify dark matter and dark energy. The resulting spacetime is asymptotically non-flat and feature two distinct horizons, determined by the Chaplygin parameter {\alpha}. Observational constraints favor negative values of {\alpha}, which restrict the allowed parameter space. Through linear perturbation analysis, we show that this blackhole remain stable under both scalar and electromagnetic perturbation. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectra depend sensitively on the MGCG parameters, indicating that this cosmological model leaves characteristic imprints on blackhole oscillations. These results suggest that gravitational-wave observations of blackhole ringdowns may provide a means of constraining MGCG and testing unified dark sector scenarios in the strong-field regime.

 - **Abstract**
 We study exact cosmological solutions in $f(Q)$ gravity formulated beyond the coincident gauge, focusing on the non-coincident connection branch $\Gamma_B$. Using a minisuperspace approach, the field equations are recast into an equivalent scalar-tensor form, enabling analytic reconstruction of cosmological models. We obtain exact solutions of particular interest, including de Sitter, scaling, $\Lambda$CDM, Chaplygin gas, generalized Chaplygin gas, and CPL parameterizations. The corresponding scalar potentials and $f(Q)$ functions are derived in closed or parametric form. Our analysis shows that non-coincident $f(Q)$ gravity admits a richer solution space than the coincident case and can describe both early-time inflationary dynamics and late-time acceleration within a unified framework. These results open new directions for testing $f(Q)$ cosmology against observations and exploring its role as a viable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM.

 This note serves two purposes: 1) define actions by differential graded Lie algebras, and 2) apply such differential graded Lie symmetry in general relativity (GR) to constrain the spacetime geometry on a neighborhood of infinity.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit string theoretic derivations of black hole entropy and argue that their enabling structures do not persist in realistic cosmologies. We formalize this as the Thermodynamic Split Conjecture (TSC) which is the statement that in any UV complete quantum gravity, black hole and cosmological horizon thermodynamics are generically inequivalent. The BKE criterion is then formulated to formalize this approach while we also discuss ways to falsify the conjecture. Finally, we propose an observational scaling test which is centered around comparisons of data native entropy proxies from tomographic maps to the Bekenstein Hawking prediction. The framework both sharpens when and why the area law holds and provides a roadmap towards a UV complete description of cosmological horizon entropy.
