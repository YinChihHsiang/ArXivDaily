 - **Abstract**
 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are recurring X-ray bursts originating from the vicinity of supermassive black holes, but their driving mechanisms remain under debate. This study analyzes new NICER observations of QPEs in Ansky (a transient event in the nucleus of the galaxy SDSS J1335+0728), taken between January and June 2025. By examining flare durations, peak-to-peak recurrence times, and profiles, we compare the 2025 data with those from 2024 to investigate changes in energy, timescales, and flare shapes. The 2025 QPEs are found to be four times more energetic, with recurrence times of approximately 10 days and flare durations ranging from 2.5 to 4 days, making them both about twice as long as in 2024. Additionally, the flare profiles have become more asymmetric, showing longer decays. We explore different theoretical scenarios to explain the observed properties of the QPEs in Ansky, including evolving stream-disk interactions in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system as a potential mechanism behind the observed changes in recurrence time and energetics, while also considering alternative models based on mass transfer and accretion disk instabilities. Continued observational efforts will be crucial for unveiling the nature of Ansky.

 - **Abstract**
 The core of a massive star (M > 8 Msun) eventually collapses. This implosion usually triggers a supernova (SN) explosion that ejects most of the stellar envelope and leaves behind a neutron star (NS) with a mass of up to about 2 Msun. Sometimes the explosion fails and a black hole forms instead. The NS radiates its immense binding energy (some 10% of its rest mass or $2-4\times10^{53}$ erg) almost entirely as neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors with typical energies of some 10 MeV. This makes core-collapse SNe the most powerful neutrino factories in the Universe. Such a signal was observed once - with limited statistics - from SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Today, however, many large neutrino detectors act as SN observatories and would register a high-statistics signal. A future Galactic SN, though rare (1-3 per century), would produce a wealth of astrophysical and particle-physics information, including possible signatures for new particles. Neutrinos are key to SN dynamics in the framework of the Bethe-Wilson delayed explosion paradigm. After collapse, they are trapped in the core for a few seconds, forming a dense neutrino plasma that can exhibit collective flavor evolution caused by the weak interaction, a subject of intense theoretical research.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the anisotropic stress parameter, $\eta=\Psi/\Phi$, defined as the ratio of the gravitational potentials in the linearly perturbed Friedmann-Lemaître Robertson-Walker metric, as a probe of deviations from general relativity across astrophysical to cosmological scales. Using mass profiles reconstructed from high-precision lensing and kinematics of nine galaxy clusters from the CLASH-VLT sample, we derive $\eta(r)$ as a function of the radial distance from the cluster centres, over the range $[0.1 \,\text{Mpc},1.2\,r_{200}^L]$, where $r_{200}^L$ is virial radius best-fit from lensing data. When using a Navarro-Frenk-White or an Hernquist profile to model the total matter distribution, we find consistency with general relativity ($\eta = 1$) within $2\sigma$ for the full radial range for all the sampled clusters. However, adopting a Burkert profile introduces mild tension with general relativity, reaching the $3\sigma$ level in two systems. Assuming a negligible time-dependence in the redshift range spawned by the clusters, we obtain the joint constraint $\eta (r= 1.0 \, \text{Mpc}) = 0.93^{+0.48}_{-0.40}$ (stat) $\pm 0.47$ (syst) at $95\% $ confidence level -- an improvement of approximately $40\%$ over previous estimates. We discuss the impact of systematics on the constraints, and we highlight the implications of this result for current and upcoming cluster surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of energy exchange among the relevant fluid components: baryonic matter, fermionic dark matter (DM), and dark energy (DE) on the internal structure of neutron stars is investigated. Using a representative DM mass $m_{\chi} = 10$ GeV and a barotropic DE relation, we add source terms Qi to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations and examine three cases: (i) noninteracting fluids (Model I), (ii) fully interacting baryon plus DM and DM with DE fluids with optional DM self repulsion (Model II), and (iii) a unified dark sector coupled to baryons (Model III). Two effects dominate: softening by massive, pressure-poor DM, and additional softening/ and binding from DE with negative pressures. Model I isolates these baselines. In Model II, exchange terms self regulate, making the mass radius curves nearly independent of the coupling parameter $\alpha$ for nearly five orders of magnitude. Model III breaks this $\alpha$ degeneracy: a sizable vacuum fraction suppresses the baryonic pressure gradient, reducing both the maximum mass and radii, whereas a pure-DM core is less sensitive. We outline when dark interactions can leave observable, macroscopic imprints.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are believed to be an ideal laboratory for studying the evolution of accretion flow around a supermassive black hole (BH). In general, the mass feeding rate to the BH is suggested to be super-Eddington initially, and evolves to be sub-Eddington on timescale of years. In this paper, we carry out calculations of the time-dependent evolution of accretion disk in the standard environment of TDE, i.e., injecting matter at the circularization radius of the stellar debris in the form of $\dot M_{\rm inject} \propto t^{-5/3}$. One of the main findings is that when $\dot M_{\rm inject}$ evolves to a value around the Eddington accretion rate, the radiation pressure instability occurs. We test the influence of the model parameters on the light curves, such as the BH mass $M_{\rm BH}$, viscosity parameter $\alpha$, and mass-injecting radius $R_{\rm{out}}$, all of which are found to affect the light curves to some extent. In most cases, we find that the light curves oscillate significantly due to the radiation pressure instability. As an exception, when $\alpha$ is small or $R_{\rm{out}}$ is large, we find that the oscillations are completely suppressed. In this case, the light curve drops steeply and then becomes flat in the late-time evolution, which is applied to explaining the observed ultraviolet (UV) light curves of ASASSN-15oi and ASASSN-14ae together with the assumption of a photosphere. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of our time-dependent accretion disk model to explaining multi-band light curves of TDEs in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass binary black hole (BBH) mergers occurring within the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are promising sources for gravitational waves detectable by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) interferometers. Some of these events have also been potentially associated with transient electromagnetic flares, indicating that BBH mergers in dense environments may be promising sources of multi-messenger signals. To investigate the prospects for electromagnetic emission from these systems, we study the dynamics of accretion flows onto BBHs embedded in AGN disks using numerical simulations. Although recent studies have explored this scenario, they often employ simplified disk models that neglect magnetic fields. In this work, we examine how strong magnetic fields influence and regulate the accretion onto such binary systems. In this context, we conduct three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical local shearing-box simulations of a binary black hole system embedded within a magnetized disk of an AGN. We observe that the dynamically important magnetic fields can drive the formation of well-collimated outflows capable of penetrating the vertical extent of the AGN disk. However, outflow generation is not ubiquitous and strongly depends on the radial distance of the binary from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). In particular, binaries placed at a larger distance from the central SMBH show relatively more transient accretion and the formation of stronger spiral shocks. Furthermore, accretion behavior onto the binary system via individual circum-singular disks (CSDs) is also modulated by local AGN disk properties. Our simulations highlight the importance of shear velocity in the amplification of the toroidal magnetic field component, which plays a crucial role in governing the outflow strength.

 - **Abstract**
 The reverberation mapping (RM) is the most promising method to measure the mass of supermassive black hole in the center of active galaxy nuclei (AGNs). However, the dominant jet component hinders the application of RM method for blazars. In this work, we present a new algorithm to disentangle the contributions of the accretion disk and relativistic jet in blazars by analyzing the optical spectroscopic data. Applying this method to two flat-spectrum radio quasars, PKS 1510-089 and PKS 0736+017, we find that the H$\gamma$ variability in PKS 1510-089 lags behind the disk by approximately 116 days, while the H$\beta$ line exhibits a lag of about 52 days relative to the disk in PKS 0736+017. Based on these measured time lags, we estimate that the black hole masses are about $1.8 \times 10^8\ M_\odot$ for PKS 1510-089 and about $7.0 \times 10^7\ M_\odot$ for PKS 0736+017, respectively. This method paves the way to apply the RM method for blazars, and improves the understanding of disk and jet activities.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole population studies are currently performed either using astrophysically motivated models (informed but rigid in their functional forms) or via non-parametric methods (flexible but not directly interpretable). In this paper, we present a statistical framework to complement the predictive power of astrophysically motivated models with the flexibility of non-parametric methods. Our method makes use of the Dirichlet distribution to robustly infer the relative weights of different models as well as of the Gibbs sampling approach to efficiently explore the parameter space. After having validated our approach using simulated data, we apply this method to the BBH mergers observed during the first three Observing Runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration using both phenomenological and astrophysical models as parametric models, finding results in agreement with the currently available literature.

 - **Abstract**
 The $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological observations. However, severe challenges to the phenomenological $\Lambda$CDM model have emerged recently, including the Hubble constant tension and the significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model reported by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration. Despite many explanations for the two challenges have been proposed, the origins of them are still intriguing mysteries. Here, we investigate the DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) measurements to interpret the Hubble constant tension. Employing a non-parametric method, we find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift from DESI BAO data and type Ia supernovae. From the Friedmann equations, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) is derived from $w(z)$ model-independently. We find that the values of $H_0$ show a descending trend as a function of redshift, and can effectively resolve the Hubble constant tension. Our study finds that the two unexpected challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM model can be understood in one physical framework, e.g., dynamical dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 Analysis of radio emission from tidal disruption events allows for detailed constraints on the properties of ejected outflows and the host environment surrounding the black hole. However, the late-time radio behaviour of tidal disruption events is not well-studied due to a lack of observations. In this work we present long-term radio monitoring observations of the tidal disruption event AT2019azh spanning 1167-2159 days post disruption. We fit a physically motivated synchrotron model to the radio spectra at each epoch, and model the decay of the light curve under the assumption that the outflow transitions into the non-relativistic Sedov-Taylor regime at late times. Through this modelling we obtain strong constraints on the density profile of the circumnuclear medium, finding an unusually flat density profile proportional to $r^{0.24^{+0.11}_{-0.15}}$. Overall we find that unlike some tidal disruption events, AT2019azh does not show late time re-brightening up to 6 years post-disruption. The Sedov-Taylor light curve decay model provides a good fit to the data, motivating the assumption that the outflow was produced by a single ejection of material close to the time of stellar disruption. From forward modelling the evolution of the radio light curve decay we predict that the radio afterglow from AT2019azh should be detectable for decades at its current rate of evolution.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17527

 - **Abstract**
 Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy is a one-parameter extension of the standard HDE framework, in which the horizon entropy is reformulated using Kaniadakis entropy. At the cosmological level, it has been shown to give rise to modified Friedmann equations, leading to a richer phenomenology compared to $\Lambda$CDM. In this work we test the Kanadiakis holography model against multiple late-time observational probes, including Type Ia supernovae from PantheonPlus and Union3, Cosmic Chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2). Using a Bayesian inference approach with MCMC methods, we constrain the cosmological parameters of the model and evaluate its performance against $\Lambda$CDM through the Akaike Information Criterion. We find that Kaniadakis holography can provide a better fit for some data combinations, although $\Lambda$CDM remains slightly statistically favored overall. These results highlight Kaniadakis holography as a competitive alternative to the standard cosmological model, offering valuable insights into the role of generalized entropy in dark energy dynamics.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17586

 - **Abstract**
 Current cosmological data seem to show that dark energy is evolving in time and that it possibly crossed the phantom divide in the past. So far the only theories that lead to such a behavior involve a non-trivial coupling between dark energy, in the form of a scalar field, and the gravitational or matter sector. We show that there is another possibility involving both a non-trivial kinetic sector in a cubic Galileon theory and a scalar field potential that breaks the Galileon shift symmetry, which can lead to a similar phenomenology on large scales. We perform a full Bayesian analysis using the latest cosmological data, including DESI DR2 BAO measurements, type Ia SNe measurements from DESY5, Union3, and Pantheon+, and CMB data from Planck and ACT. We find that it is statistically strongly favored over a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant (with a Bayes factor of $\log B\simeq 6.5$). Yet, as with other non-minimally coupled theories, it has severe ancillary gravitational effects. These can be mitigated to some extent, but as with other viable theories, the penalty is ever more elaborate scalar field models of dark energy.

#### Unveiling the Quantum Nature of Black Holes: Towards a Proof of Hawking Radiation through Gamma-Ray Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Hawking's groundbreaking prediction that black holes emit thermal radiation and ultimately evaporate remains unverified due to the extreme faintness of this radiation for stellar-mass or larger black holes. In this study, we explore a novel observational strategy to search for Hawking radiation from asteroid-mass black hole morsels -- hypothetical small black holes that may form and be ejected during catastrophic events such as binary black hole mergers. These black hole morsels are expected to emit gamma rays in the GeV-TeV range on observable timescales. We analyze data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope coinciding with the well-localized binary black hole merger GW170814, searching for delayed gamma-ray signatures associated with morsel evaporation. While we find no evidence for such emission, we place exclusion limits on morsel masses, ruling out the 4 x 10^8 kg scenario at the 95 percent confidence level for a total emitted mass of one solar mass. We also outline future directions, including the incorporation of late-time evaporation spikes, systematic application across the growing gravitational wave catalog, and the enhanced discovery potential of next-generation facilities such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we develop a Neural Likelihood Estimator and apply it to analyse real gravitational-wave (GW) data for the first time. We assess the usability of neural likelihood for GW parameter estimation and report the parameter space where neural likelihood performs as a robust estimator to output posterior probability distributions using modest computational resources. In addition, we demonstrate that the trained Neural likelihood can also be used in further analysis, enabling us to obtain the evidence corresponding to a hypothesis, making our method a complete tool for parameter estimation. Particularly, our method requires around 100 times fewer likelihood evaluations than standard Bayesian algorithms to infer properties of a GW signal from a binary black hole system as observed by current generation ground-based detectors. The fairly simple neural network architecture chosen makes for cheap training, which allows our method to be used on-the-fly without the need for special hardware and ensures our method is flexible to use any waveform model, noise model, or prior. We show results from simulations as well as results from GW150914 as proof of the effectiveness of our algorithm.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite decades of direct and indirect searches within the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) framework, no conclusive results have been found in the GeV--TeV range. This has motivated exploring alternatives, including new particles and macroscopic objects. Two well-motivated scenarios are sub-GeV DM and Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). Molecular clouds (MCs), typically studied as star-forming sites, can serve as astrophysical laboratories to probe these candidates via their ionization rates. Observations show ionization levels exceeding expectations from known CR fluxes, pointing to an additional ionizing component. Here, we consider electrons and positrons from annihilating and decaying MeV DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from evaporating PBHs, as possible contributors. We model transport driven by energy losses within the clouds. By comparing predicted ionization rates with observations, conservative constraints are set on the thermally averaged cross section $\langle\sigma v\rangle$, decay lifetime $\tau$ and PBH abundances $f_{PBH}$. The analysis assumes all the observed ionization comes from DM and adopts a 95% confidence level. Results show that, even in the most conservative case of local MCs such as L1551, these constraints are very close to the most competitive bounds from X-ray observations, while inner-Galaxy clouds like DRAGON or G1.4--1.8+87 provide stronger limits, sometimes improving X-ray and cosmological constraints. For sub-GeV DM, MCs exclude parameter space competitive with the one tested by NuSTAR, INTEGRAL, or Voyager, especially below $\sim$30 MeV. In the PBH case, asteroid-mass black holes are restricted to a low fraction of DM, with optimistic scenarios getting close to the strongest limits. This demonstrates the potential of MCs as a novel probe in indirect DM searches.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy mergers are believed to play an important role in triggering rapid supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. As merging nuclei approach each other, the physical properties of the participating galaxies and the associated SMBH growth are expected to evolve significantly. This study measures and characterizes these physical properties throughout the merger sequence. We constructed multiwavelength Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) from hard X-rays to the far-infrared (FIR) for a sample of 72 nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. The sample comprises 64 interacting systems, including single AGNs in mergers and dual AGNs, with nuclear separations $\leq$30 kpc, as well as eight isolated active galaxies with merging features. We carefully adapted available photometric measurements at each wavelength to account for their complex morphologies and varying spatial resolutions, to perform SED fitting using CIGALE, aimed to derive critical physical properties. Our results reveal that merging galaxies hosting AGN(s) show deviations from the star-forming main sequence, and a wide range of star formation rates (SFRs). Both AGN activity and star formation are significantly influenced by the merger process, but these effects are more prominent in major, mass ratios $<$4:1, interactions. We find that the projected nuclear separation is not a good tracer of the merger stage. Instead, morphological classification accurately assesses the merger progression. Based on this morphological analysis, late-stage mergers exhibit elevated SFRs (5.1$\times$), AGN luminosities (2.4$\times$), and nuclear obscuration (2.8$\times$) compared to earlier stages, supporting previous findings and reinforcing the link between merger-driven galaxy evolution and SMBH growth.

 - **Abstract**
 The extragalactic background is composed of the emission from all astrophysical sources, both resolved and unresolved, in addition to any diffuse components. In the last decade, there has been significant progress in our understanding of the cosmic history of extragalactic emissions associated with stellar evolution and accretion onto supermassive black holes, largely enabled by the extensive body of multi-wavelength data. The brightness of the extragalactic sky is now measured in photons, neutrinos, and cosmic rays, using observatories on the ground, in the sea, and in the ice, satellites in Earth orbit, and probes at the edge of the solar system. This wealth of disparate data is essential to unraveling the mysteries of the source populations that contribute to the extragalactic background. In this contribution, we present an open database containing the most comprehensive collection of measurements of the extragalactic background spectrum to date. The combination of multi-messenger measurements over 27 frequency decades allows us to estimate the energy density of most extragalactic background components with an uncertainty of less than 30%. We explore the consistency of this cosmic inventory of the observed fields of relativistic particles populating the Universe with the cosmic history of star formation and accretion around supermassive black holes. Models incorporating these cosmic histories, as well as the redshift-dependent luminosity functions of extragalactic sources, currently match the electromagnetic component of the extragalactic background spectrum over 14 frequency decades, from the near UV to sub-TeV gamma rays. The knowledge gained from synthetic population models in the electromagnetic bands may become a crucial tool for understanding the origin of the most energetic extragalactic messengers, neutrinos and ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays.

 We present spectroscopic data of strong lenses and their source galaxies using the Keck Near-Infrared Echellette Spectrometer (NIRES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), providing redshifts necessary for nearly all strong-lensing applications with these systems, especially the extraction of physical parameters from lensing modeling. These strong lenses were found in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using Residual Neural Networks (ResNet) and followed up by our Hubble Space Telescope program, with all systems displaying unambiguous lensed arcs. With NIRES, we target eight lensed sources at redshifts difficult to measure in the optical range and determine the source redshifts for six, between $z_s$ = 1.675 and 3.332. DESI observed one of the remaining source redshifts, as well as an additional source redshift within the six systems. The two systems with non-detections by NIRES were observed for a considerably shorter 600s at high airmass. Combining NIRES infrared spectroscopy with optical spectroscopy from our DESI Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program, these results provide the complete lens and source redshifts for six systems, a resource for refining automated strong lens searches in future deep- and wide-field imaging surveys and addressing a range of questions in astrophysics and cosmology.

 We present the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program. This is a spectroscopic follow-up program for strong gravitational lens candidates found in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys footprint. Spectroscopic redshifts for the lenses and lensed source are crucial for lens modeling to obtain physical parameters. The spectroscopic catalog in this paper consists of 73 candidate systems from the DESI Early Data Release (EDR). We have confirmed 20 strong lensing systems and determined four to not be lenses. For the remaining systems, more spectroscopic data from ongoing and future observations will be presented in future publications. We discuss the implications of our results for lens searches with neural networks in existing and future imaging surveys as well as for lens modeling. This Strong Lensing Secondary Target Program is part of the DESI Strong Lens Foundry project, and this is Paper II of a series on this project.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent non-modal analyses have uncovered spectral instabilities in the quasinormal-mode spectrum of black holes; a phenomenon that intriguingly extends to spherically-symmetric exotic compact objects. These results point to a sensitivity of the spectrum with potentially far-reaching implications for black-hole spectroscopy. At the same time, growing attention has turned to astrophysical environments around compact objects and their role in shaping gravitational-wave astrophysics. In this work, we establish a direct link between spectral instabilities and environmental effects by modeling matter as a localized bump outside the light ring of a spectrally-unstable exotic compact object with a purely reflective surface. We find that while such environments can destabilize the fundamental quasinormal modes of loosely-compact exotic objects, the fundamental modes of ultra-compact horizonless objects remain remarkably robust. In contrast, overtones are shown to develop spectral instabilities in the presence of the bump. By tracking both interior modes, trapped between the light ring and the surface of the exotic compact object, and exterior modes, confined between the bump and the light ring, we uncover an overtaking instability in which ``unperturbed'' exterior overtones metamorphose into ``perturbed'' fundamental modes as the bump moves outward. Finally, we demonstrate that environmental effects, while capable of further amplifying spectral instabilities, cannot induce next-to-leading-order perturbations strong enough to trigger a modal instability.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate, for the first time, universal relations for anisotropic dark energy stars. The stars are modeled with the modified Chaplygin equation of state and the Bowers-Liang prescription for anisotropy, and their global properties and $f$-mode frequencies are computed using the modified relativistic Hartle-Thorne slow rotation and Cowling approximations. We find that relations among moment of inertia, tidal deformability, quadrupole moment and $f$-mode frequency exhibit universality, with deviations limited to $1-10\%$, in close agreement with other compact star models. Using tidal deformability constraints from GW170817 and GW190814, we obtain astrophysical limits on canonical properties of dark energy stars. For positive anisotropy strength, the radius of a $1.4M_\odot$ star is constrained to $R_{1.4}=8.93^{1.88}_{1.40}$ km (GW170817) and $10.92^{+0.71}_{-0.54}$ km (GW190814), consistent with observational bounds. The corresponding $f$-mode frequencies are constrained to $3.257^{+0.450}_{-0.537}$ kHz and $2.692^{+0.137}_{-0.157}$ kHz. Further, applying Pearson correlation analysis for the first time to anisotropic compact stars, we obtained the coefficients between various stellar attributes of dark energy stars and we show that the Chaplygin parameter $B$ correlates strongly with the $f$-mode frequency, with positive anisotropy strengthening while negative anisotropy weakening the correlation strength. These results establish that universal relations extend to anisotropic dark energy stars and can be directly tested with present and future gravitational-wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We obtain rotating black hole solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations with the cosmological constant. There are eight parameters in the solutions. They are the physical mass $M$, the electric charge $Q$, the specific angular momentum $a$, the acceleration $\alpha$, the cosmological constant $\lambda$ and other three parameters, $S_1\;, S_2$ and $S_3$. We show that $S_3$ and $S_1$ are actually the well-known NUT charge and the rescaled parameter $C$, respectively, for the Kerr-NUT spacetime. As for $S_2$, it is a new parameter although it has the same physical meaning of $C$ in the weak field limit. In the case of static limit, $S_2$ describes a conical defect along the axis of revolution, which corresponds to a cosmic string of tension. Therefore, the solutions extend the accelerating Kerr-Newman-NUT-de Sitter spacetime.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct and analyze a novel family of exact higher-dimensional black hole solutions in Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills gravity minimally coupled to a scalar field multiplet supporting a global monopole and a surrounding anisotropic ''scalar gas'' whose stress-energy obeys a generalized Murnaghan equation of state. By adopting the Wu-Yang magnetic ansatz for the non-Abelian sector and enforcing the physically motivated radial condition $p_r=-\rho$, the field equations admit closed-form expressions for the matter density and a single-function lapse $F(r)$ expressed in terms of elementary and Gauss hypergeometric functions. The Murnaghan fluid interpolates between a non-linear core and an effective vacuum at a large radius, producing a backreaction encoded by parameters that control the stiffness and scalar-backreaction scale. We perform a systematic survey of classical energy condition, identifying regions of parameter space where the null energy condition/dominant energy condition holds while the strong energy condition is generically violated (phantom-like behavior), and examine curvature invariants to demonstrate that the solutions possess a central curvature singularity for $n>3$. Thermodynamic properties are derived in the extended phase space: explicit formulas for the Hawking temperature, entropy, conjugate potentials, and a generalized Smarr relation are obtained; the heat capacity exhibits divergencies and sign changes that mark local stability boundaries and second-order phase transitions. Varying the Yang-Mills charge, the nonlinearity index, the monopole coupling, and the Murnaghan parameters generates a rich phase behavior structure and topology changes in the defect ($\varphi$-Duan) map. The results underscore the manner in which gauge nonlinearity, topological defects, and dual-polytropic matter collaboratively transform BH thermodynamics and the topology of phase spaces.

 - **Abstract**
 We study slowly rotating traversable wormholes embedded in realistic galactic dark matter halos, including Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), Bose-Einstein Condensate (Thomas-Fermi, TF), and pseudo-isothermal (PI) profiles. Using the Teo-type rotating wormhole metric, we construct shape functions from halo density distributions and analyze the resulting geometrical properties, such as throat structure, flaring-out conditions, and violations of the null energy condition. We examine null geodesics, effective potentials, photon spheres, and Lense-Thirring (LT) precession, highlighting differences between cuspy and cored halo models. Finally, we calculate wormhole shadows, observing that cuspy NFW halos tend to produce smaller, asymmetric shadows, while cored TF and PI halos yield smoother, nearly circular silhouettes. The findings provide a theoretical characterization of photon dynamics and shadow morphology in wormholes embedded within different dark matter environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a phenomenological study of rotating, charged black holes in Einstein gravity coupled to a traceless (conformal) matter sector formed by ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics and a Kalb-Ramond two-form that spontaneously breaks local Lorentz symmetry. Starting from a family of obtained static, Schwarzschild-like solutions with a traceless Kalb-Ramond sector, we construct the stationary, axisymmetric counterpart via the Newman-Janis algorithm. The resulting Newman-Kerr-like metric depends on four intrinsic parameters: the electric charge $Q$, the ModMax nonlinearity $\gamma$, the Lorentz-violation amplitude $\ell$ and the spin $a$. We analyze horizon structure and separatrices in parameter space, derive the null geodesic equations and obtain the photon capture boundary that defines the black hole shadow. Using ray-tracing, we compute shadow silhouettes and a suite of shadow observables (areal radius, characteristic radius $R_s$, distortion $\delta$, oblateness $D$) and show how $\gamma$ and $\ell$ produce qualitatively distinct effects: $\gamma$ acts as a screening factor for the electromagnetic imprint, while $\ell$ introduces angular-dependent metric rescalings that deform shadow shape beyond simple size rescaling. We confront model predictions with EHT angular-radius measurements for M87$^*$ and Sgr A$^*$ and derive conservative bounds on the combinations of $(Q,\gamma,\ell,a)$. Our results identify an effective charge combination $Q_{\rm eff}\simeq e^{-\gamma}Q^{2}/(1-\ell)^{2}$ and demonstrate that modest $Q_{\rm eff}$ remains compatible with current EHT images while large $Q_{\rm eff}$ is progressively disfavored.

 - **Abstract**
 The extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are emerging as precision laboratories for testing the gravity beyond general relativity. In this work, we investigate the Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) effect induced by the Kalb-Ramond (KR) field on the gravitational waveforms from the EMRI system. We observe that the LSB parameter $l$ appears in the leading order for the corrections of energy and angular momentum fluxes, and as $|l|$ increases, the differences in EMRI waveforms between the KR black hole and Schwarzschild black hole become more pronounced. We note that the LSB effect becomes detectable by LISA for values of $|l|\sim 10^{-6}$ with a one-year observation period. Furthermore, we use the Fisher information matrix (FIM) approach for the parameter estimation and find the detection error for $l$ can be constrained to $\Delta l \sim 10^{-5}$ at $\mathrm{SNR} = 20$, demonstrating the potential of space-based gravitational wave detectors to rigorously test the KR field.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the post-Newtonian (PN) dynamics of energy-momentum squared gravity (EMSG), with particular emphasis on the possibility of self-acceleration in $N$-body systems. A central challenge in matter-type modified gravity theories, including EMSG, is the non-vanishing divergence of the energy-momentum tensor, arising from the nonminimal interaction between the standard and modified matter fields. This feature can, in principle, influence the $N$-body dynamics. In our previous work [1], its effects on the external-dependent part of the motion were studied in an EMSG class known as quadratic-EMSG. Here, we extend the analysis to the internal-structure-dependent contributions, namely self-acceleration. To this end, we relax the reflection-symmetric assumption adopted in [1] and derive the complete equations of motion for a self-gravitating body in an $N$-body system up to the first PN order. By introducing a suitable expression for the center-of-mass acceleration and employing virial identities, including one newly emerging within the quadratic-EMSG framework, it is shown that self-acceleration vanishes. Furthermore, we establish a PN integral conservation law for the total momentum, demonstrating that, as in general relativity (GR), EMSG admits a conserved linear momentum compatible with the absence of self-acceleration. Binary pulsar experiments provide stringent bounds on self-acceleration, and our analysis shows that, within the present level of accuracy, EMSG is consistent with these constraints. Therefore, the theory remains viable in the strong-gravity regime probed by binary pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present strong evidence for dynamical dark energy challenging the $\Lambda$CDM model. Several dark energy models are explored, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, and BA, along with non-flat cosmologies accounting for potential spatial curvature. Our analysis supports a flat Universe ($\Omega_k \approx 0$). Using the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm, we analyze data from BAO of DESI DR2, Type Ia Supernovae, and CMB to constrain model parameters. We find strong evidence that $\omega \neq -1$, with deviations from $\Lambda$CDM favoring dynamical dark energy consistent with the Quintom-B scenario ($\omega_0 > -1$, $\omega_a < 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a < -1$). We also derive upper bounds on $\sum m_\nu$ from CMB + DESI DR2. For $\Lambda$CDM we find $\sum m_\nu < 0.066~\text{eV}$, while for $\omega$CDM it is $\sum m_\nu < 0.075~\text{eV}$. In o$\Lambda$CDM and o$\omega$CDM the limits are $\sum m_\nu < 0.263~\text{eV}$ and $\sum m_\nu < 0.520~\text{eV}$, respectively. For other models, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE, the upper limits range from $< 0.043~\text{eV}$ to $< 0.127~\text{eV}$. Constraints on the effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\text{eff}}$, remain consistent with the standard value $N_{\text{eff}} = 3.044$ for all models. Bayesian evidence shows that combining DES-SN5Y and Union3 SNe Ia with CMB + DESI DR2 reveals deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, while no model reaches the $5\sigma$ threshold, some show $> 3\sigma$ tensions with DES-SN5YR or Union3, hinting at cracks in the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.

 - **Abstract**
 The observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. In this work, we explore gravitational baryogenesis within the framework of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian depends on both the torsion scalar $T$ and the matter Lagrangian $L_m$. We consider three representative models and examine their ability to generate the observed baryon-to-entropy ratio. Our analysis shows that couplings involving both torsion and the matter Lagrangian, $\partial_\mu(-T-\frac{L_m}{L_0})$, can successfully account for the baryon asymmetry for decoupling temperatures in the range $10^{12}$-$10^{14}\,\text{GeV}$, while remaining consistent with small deviations from General Relativity. These results highlight the capacity of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity to provide novel mechanisms for baryogenesis, demonstrating that the interplay between torsion and matter-sector contributions can naturally generate the observed asymmetry. The framework also remains compatible with late-time cosmological evolution, offering a unified setting for early- and late-time dynamics.

#### Black-hole ringdown analysis with inspiral-merger informed templates and limitations of classical spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 The ringdown of a perturbed black hole consists of a superposition of quasi-normal modes (QNMs), with complex frequencies determined by the black hole's mass and spin, while phases and amplitudes depend on binary parameters. Traditional semi-agnostic ringdown analyses ignore the remnant's binary-merger origin, assuming instead generic perturbations. This can lead to an unphysical number of free parameters and usage of priors inconsistent with those imposed by full inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) analysis. Here we revisit an alternative approach, first proposed in Calderón Bustillo et al. 2021, in which ringdowns are modeled using the post-merger portion of full IMR waveform models. This naturally includes all QNMs without adding extra degrees of freedom and ties priors to binary parameters. We analyze the signal GW150914 with the post-merger portion of the IMR surrogate model NRSur7dq4, finding decisive evidence for the no-hair theorem with a Bayes factor $>650:1$ or $>99.8$% probability, compared to only $3:1$ from semi-agnostic spectroscopy, consistent with previous work. We also find modest evidence ($\simeq 5:1$) for the $(\ell,m,n)=(2,2,1)$ overtone and none for higher modes. Using simulated signals, we validate our formalism by showing accurate recovery of remnant properties. Next, by analysing simulated signals with post-merger signal-to-noise ratios up to 100, we show that classical spectroscopy based on overtone detection alone cannot provide strong no-hair tests. Finally, we demonstrate that the non-orthogonality of QNMs makes the inferred mode content strongly model-dependent, leading to multiple inconsistent interpretations that are equally well-supported by the data. We briefly discuss potential implications for recent events, such as GW231123 and GW250114.

 - **Abstract**
 We test the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC) for the Kerr-Newman-modified gravity black hole (KN-MOG-BH) by interacting scalar test fields with the KN-MOG-BH. Neglecting backreaction effects, we first show that the scalar test fields with frequencies just above the superradiance threshold can overspin both extremal and nearly extremal KN-MOG-BHs, leading to the formation of naked singularities. Moreover, test fields can continuously push nearly extremal KN-MOG-BHs toward their extremal limit. Next, we incorporate backreaction effects, assuming that the event horizon's angular velocity rises prior to the test field's absorption. We show that backreaction prevents overspinning in the extremal KN-MOG-BH, whereas in the nearly extremal case, it fails to stop the BH from being overspun.

The Lorentz symmetry breaking affects the mass and temperature of the BH but does not its thermodynamic topological classification.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute the gravitational waveform emitted during the transition from quasi-spherical inspiral to plunge, merger and ringdown for a system of two black holes in the extreme mass ratio limit, where the primary is spinning and the secondary is represented by a nonspinning point-particle inspiralling along inclined orbits. The point-particle dynamics is described via a Hamiltonian formalism and the transition is driven by an effective-one-body like radiation reaction force. The gravitational waveform is obtained solving numerically, in the time-domain, the Teukolsky equation with a $\delta$-like source. The waveform is systematically characterized varying the black hole spin magnitude between $(0,0.9)$ and the inclination angle of the orbit between $(0,\pi)$. We consider all multipoles up to $\ell=4$ and compute the energy and angular momentum losses during the plunge. The impact of the $m\neq \ell$ modes grows as the inclination angle is increased. We also use our framework to quantify the accuracy of the approximate inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform for an inclined orbit that can be obtained by applying a suitable time-dependent rotation to a given spin-aligned waveform with approximately consistent (but constant) spin-orbit coupling.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we construct spherically symmetric solutions of Bardeen--boson stars within the framework of the Einstein--Klein--Gordon theory coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics by employing numerical methods. Considering a thin accretion disk in the equatorial plane as the light source, we systematically investigate the optical appearance of boson stars using the ray-tracing method and the stereographic projection technique. Particular attention is paid to the influence of the initial scalar field $\phi_0$, the magnetic charge $\mathcal{G}$, and the observation angle $\theta_o$, on the image structure. As compact horizonless objects, boson stars produce optical images dominated by direct emission, while their morphology undergoes significant distortions as $\theta_o$ increases. Higher values of $\phi_0$ and $\theta_o$ can give rise to lensing images. For all the parameters, the image center exhibits a brightness depression similar to the inner shadow of black holes, which poses challenges for distinguishing between boson stars and black holes. To address this, we propose two possible approaches: (i) combining the analysis of lensing bands with the effective potential to determine the existence of photon rings; and (ii) examining the polarization effects under synchrotron emission mechanisms. These results provide theoretical support for future high-resolution imaging efforts aimed at discriminating boson stars from black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences provide unique opportunities to test general relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime. In particular, the merger phase, during which two compact objects finally coalesce, corresponds to the regime of the strongest gravitational fields accessible by direct observation and thus serves as a probe of the nonlinear nature of gravity. In this work, we test GR in the merger phase by analyzing GW150914 using a modified waveform proposed in [Watarai et al. 2024], which parametrizes possible deviations from GR during this stage. Within this framework, the inferred deviation parameters can be translated into model-independent constraints on physically meaningful quantities. For GW150914, we find that the additional energy radiated in the merger phase is constrained to be $0.26^{+0.75}_{-0.62}~\%$ of the total energy emitted over the entire coalescence predicted by GR, and the deviation in the coalescence time is $2.17^{+9.56}_{-9.90}~\mathrm{ms}$, both within the $90\%$ credible interval. These two constraints serve as observational benchmarks for deviations in the nonlinear gravity regime, offering guidance for theoretical investigations of beyond-GR models.

 - **Abstract**
 This work investigates black holes within a modified framework of gravity that incorporates quantum-inspired corrections and a fundamental minimal length scale. By integrating Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a specially tailored matter source that models quantum particle creation, we derive novel, non-singular black hole solutions. These black holes exhibit rich horizon structures and, notably, do not undergo complete evaporation -- instead, they stabilize into permanent remnants. In addition to analyzing the thermodynamic implications of quantum corrections to Dymnikova-Schwinger black holes, we examine their quasinormal mode spectra using the WKB approximation, alongside their associated energy emission rates. Our findings provide compelling new perspectives on how quantum effects may address foundational issues such as the black hole information loss paradox.

 This paper investigates a new black hole solution within the framework of bumblebee gravity, incorporating non-commutative corrections parameterized by $\Theta$ and implemented through the Moyal twist $\partial_r \wedge \partial_\theta$. Notably, the event horizon remains unaffected by $\Theta$, while the surface gravity becomes ill-defined, in agreement with the behavior previously reported for the non-commutative Schwarzschild black hole [1]. The propagation of light is examined by analyzing null geodesics, identifying critical orbits, and determining the resulting black hole shadow. To complement these analyses, we explore gravitational lensing by evaluating the deflection angle in both the weak- and strong-field regimes. Using these results, constraints are derived for the lensing observables by comparing with the Event Horizon Telescope data for $Sgr A^{*}$ and $M87^{*}$. Finally, we close the analysis by deriving additional constraints from standard Solar System experiments, including Mercury's orbital precession, gravitational light bending, and time-delay measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate a nonlinear mechanism driving the formation of scalarized rotating black holes within a scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity framework that includes an additional squared Gauss-Bonnet term. With the specific coupling function, Kerr metric is a solution to this modified gravity. In linear level Kerr black holes are stable against the scalar perturbation, while nonlinearly they suffer the so-called ``nonlinear scalarization" and are unstable. By employing a pseudo-spectral method, we derive the spectrum of nonlinearly scalarized rotating black hole solutions, revealing multiple scalarized branches. Our analysis demonstrates that both the black hole's spin and the additional squared Gauss-Bonnet term significantly influence the existence and properties of these solutions. Furthermore, we explore the thermodynamic properties of nonlinearly scalarized rotating black holes, and find that the scalarized black holes are entropically favored over Kerr black holes of the same mass and spin across a wide range of parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a massive scalar field in the background of a regular black hole arising from the proper-time flow in asymptotically safe gravity. This quantum-corrected geometry, characterized by a deformation parameter q, smoothly interpolates between a near-extremal regular black hole and the Schwarzschild solution. Employing both the WKB approximation with Padé resummation and time-domain integration, we compute the complex frequencies for various values of the scalar field mass $\mu$, multipole number $\ell$, and deformation parameter q. We observe that the real parts of the QNMs increase with the field mass, while the imaginary parts exhibit behavior indicative of long-lived modes. Although quasi-resonances are not detected in the time-domain profiles due to the dominance of late-time tails, we find that the asymptotic decay follows an oscillatory slowly decaying behavior with the power-law envelope.

 - **Abstract**
 This thesis deals with the phase space realization of asymptotic higher spin symmetries, in 4d asymptotically flat spacetimes. In the gravitational case for instance, these symmetries generalize the BMS algebra to include an infinite tower of symmetry generators constructed from tensors on the sphere of arbitrary high rank $s$. Building on a first series of results on their canonical representation, we develop the necessary framework to define Noether charges for all degrees $s$. Importantly, we construct these charges out of a `holomorphic' asymptotic symplectic potential, such that we obtain an infinite collection of charges conserved in the absence of radiation. The classical symmetry is then realized non-perturbatively and non-linearly in the so-called holomorphic coupling constant, generalizing the perturbative linear and quadratic approach known so far. The infinitesimal action defines a symmetry algebroid which reduces to a symmetry algebra at non-radiative cuts of $\mathscr{I}$. The key ingredient for our construction is to consider field and time dependent symmetry parameters constrained to evolve according to equations of motion dual to (a truncation of) the asymptotic equations of motion in vacuum. We expose our results for Yang-Mills, General Relativity, and Einstein-Yang-Mills theories. This canonical analysis comes hand in hand with an in-depth study of the algebraic structure underlying the symmetry. We reveal several Lie algebroid and Lie algebra brackets, which connect the Carrollian, celestial and twistorial realizations. For the specific case of non-abelian gauge theory, we also investigate how the asymptotic expansion around null infinity of the full Yang-Mills equations of motion in vacuum can be recast in terms of the higher spin charge aspects.

 - **Abstract**
 Multifield models, arising from multiple scalars interacting with gravity, provide a rich theoretical framework for addressing fundamental problems in modern cosmology. A key role in this regard is played by the so called rapid turn regime, which is characterized by background solutions with strongly non-geodesic field-space trajectories. We review the implications of this regime for a number of problems relevant for cosmological inflation, dark matter and dark energy. We focus, in more detail, on a class of exact rapid-turn solutions that give a model of dynamical dark energy. In this model, the sound speed of the dark energy perturbations is reduced compared to the speed of light, which leads to observational differences from a cosmological constant even for an equation-of-state parameter very close to -1. Furthermore, this model holds promise for the simultaneous alleviation of two prominent cosmological tensions.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute the potential-graviton contributions to the conservative scattering angle of two non-spinning bodies in maximal supergravity at fifth order in Newton's constant, including second-order self-force effects. Our goal is to tackle the challenging integrals arising at this order in Einstein gravity, but within the technically simpler framework of supergravity. The calculation employs the scattering-amplitude framework, effective field theory, and multi-loop integration techniques based on integration by parts and differential equations. The final result is expressed as a series expansion around the static limit, thereby avoiding the explicit evaluation of intricate special functions. This series solution for the master integrals applies, as well, to the corresponding computation in general relativity. Remarkably, we observe nontrivial cancellations among contributions associated with Calabi-Yau integrals, alongside a distinct contribution governed by a Heun differential equation.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct an exact solution in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, describing multi-centered rotating black holes carrying both electric and magnetic charges, obtained via dimensional reduction from five-dimensional Einstein gravity. This generalizes the Majumdar-Papapetrou solution to the rotating case, and extends the recent multi-centered rotating black hole solutions of Teo and Wan to configurations with unequal electric and magnetic charges. The resulting spacetimes are free of curvature singularities, conical defects, Dirac-Misner strings, and closed timelike curves, both on and outside the horizons, provided that the black holes have either aligned or anti-aligned spin orientations.

 - **Abstract**
 Quantum Field Theory (QFT) introduced us to the notion that a causal diamond in space-time corresponded to a subsystem of a quantum mechanical system defined on the global space-time. Work by Jacobson\cite{ted95}, Fischler and Susskind\cite{fs} and particularly Bousso\cite{bousso} suggested that in the quantum theory of gravity this subsystem should have a density matrix of finite entropy. These authors formalized older intuitive arguments based on black hole physics. Although mathematically, Type II von Neumann algebras admit finite entropy density matrices, the black hole arguments suggest that the number of physical states in these subsystems is finite. The conjecture that de Sitter (dS) space has a finite number of physical states was first made in\cite{tb}\cite{wf}. ``String theory constructions" of ``meta-stable dS states" always involve a model with an infinite number of states. The real challenge of such models is to define the asymptotic correlation functions of the space-time to which the dS space decays, and show how to isolate properties of the dS ``resonance" from those correlators. We argue that the theory of the resonance itself is adequately described, on time scales shorter than its lifetime, by a model with a finite number of states.

 - **Abstract**
 In Ref.~\cite{Grozdanov:2024wgo}, we derived a spectral duality relation applicable to the spectra of 3$d$ conformal field theories (CFTs) and their holographically dual 4$d$ black holes. In this work, we further elaborate on the properties of this duality relation and argue that the same relation can be applied to certain pairs of thermal correlator spectra in large-$N$ quantum field theories in any number of spacetime dimensions, provided the correlators are meromorphic functions with only simple poles and satisfy the thermal product formula. We discuss a rich set of properties that such retarded two-point functions must exhibit. We then show that the spectral duality relation and its implications apply to pairs of correlators in double-trace deformed CFTs and, more generally, to correlators in theories related by the Legendre transform. We illustrate, through several examples, how the spectrum of one correlator can be reconstructed from that of its dual correlation function. Notably, this includes cases relating the thermal spectra of scalar primary operators at ultraviolet and infrared fixed points, as well as current operators in a CFT$_3$ and its particle-vortex dual.
