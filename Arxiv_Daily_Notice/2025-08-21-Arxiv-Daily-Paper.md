 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave measurements of the binary black hole population provide insights into the evolution of merging binaries. We explore potential correlation between mass and mass ratio with phenomenological population models where the minimum mass of the smaller (secondary) black hole can change with the mass of the bigger (primary) black hole. We use binary black hole signals from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog with and without the relatively extreme mass-ratio GW190814. When excluding GW190814, models with a variable minimum mass are disfavoured compared to one with a constant minimum mass, with log Bayes factors of -2.49 to -0.98, indicating that the biggest black holes can merge with the smallest. When including GW190814, a parabola model that allows the minimum mass to decrease with increasing primary mass is favoured over a constant minimum-mass model with a log Bayes factor of 4.44. When allowing the minimum mass to decrease, the overall population distributions remain similar whether or not GW190814 is included. This shows that with added model flexibility, we can reconcile potential outlier observations within our population. These investigations motivate further explorations of correlations between mass ratio and component masses in order to understand how evolutionary processes may leave an imprint on these distributions.

 - **Abstract**
 Envelope stripping, whether through single-star wind mass loss or binary mass transfer, is a key evolutionary pathway for the formation of classical Wolf-Rayet stars and lower-mass stripped helium (He) stars. However, to study the evolution of these objects into black holes, neutron stars, and stripped-envelope supernovae, we need appropriate input models for the core-He burning phase without relying on the uncertain evolution into this evolved phase. Reliable mass-luminosity relations (MLRs) for He stars are needed for stellar wind and evolution studies, but the MLRs currently in literature are either for fully-stripped or chemically homogeneous stars, neither of which reflect the important and recently also observationally confirmed stage of partial stripping. We alleviate this drawback by computing sets of MESA synthetic structure models with partially-stripped chemical profiles, consisting of a pure-He core and a hydrogen (H)-depleted envelope with an H/He chemical gradient left behind from the receding convective core during the main sequence. As the H slope increases from 0 (full chemical homogeneity) to $\infty$ (pure-He stars) in our synthetic models, we find the luminosity to initially increase before eventually decreasing. The maximum luminosity for a given mass is reached for an intermediate H-profile slope corresponding to a partially-stripped structure, exceeding even the values documented for pure-He stars, primarily due to the H shell disproportionately dominating the total luminosity budget. We also provide convenient mass-luminosity fit relations to predict the minimum, maximum, and pure-He luminosities for a given mass -- and vice versa -- while accounting for structures achievable through partial stripping. We also explore the impact of the higher luminosity on the wind properties of partially-stripped configurations using hydrodynamically consistent atmosphere models.

#### Chemical enrichment of metal-poor stars orbiting massive black hole companions

 - **Abstract**
 There are millions of undetected black holes wandering through our galaxy. Observatories like {\it Chandra}, LIGO, and more recently, {\it Gaia}, have provided valuable insights into the configurations of these elusive objects when residing in binary systems. Motivated by these advances, we study, for the first time, the enhanced accretion of metals from the interstellar medium (ISM) onto low-mass companions in binary systems with highly unequal mass ratios, utilizing a series of hydrodynamical simulations. Our study demonstrates that a stellar companion's metal accretion history from the ISM alone, from its formation to the present, can significantly influence its surface abundances, especially when enhanced by a massive black hole companion. However, this effect is likely only measurable in stars that are still in the main sequence. Once a stellar companion evolves off the main sequence, similar to what has been observed with the {\it Gaia} BH3 companion, the initial dredge-up process are likely to erase any excess surface abundance resulting from the metals that were accreted. As we discover more unequal mass ratio binary systems, it is crucial to understand how the observed metallicity of sun-like companions may differ from their birth metallicity, especially if they are not yet evolved.

#### Parsec-scale jet precession and a putative supermassive binary black hole system in the blazar AO 0235+164
 - **Authors:** Flavio Benevenuto da Silva Junior, Anderson Caproni

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14178

 - **Abstract**
 The blazar AO 0235+164 is a key source for studying the interplay between multi-wavelength variability in its light curves and changes in the position angles and apparent velocities of its parsec-scale jet components. In this work, we analyse public interferometric radio maps of AO 0235+164 at 15 and 43 GHz, using the Cross Entropy global optimisation technique to determine the structural parameters of its jet components. We identified 36 kinematically distinct jet components across all sky quadrants, indicating a highly relativistic parsec-scale jet with a minimum Lorentz factor of 34 +/- 7 and a maximum viewing angle of 37 +/- 8 degree. The temporal evolution of these jet components was modelled as a relativistic jet under a constant precession rate. The optimal clockwise precession model has a precession period of 8.4 +\- 0.2 years, consistent with the 8.13-year periodicity previously detected in optical light curves, besides providing a time-variable Doppler boosting factor correlated with the most intense flares at gamma-ray energies. For the counter-clockwise precession, a period of 6.0 +\- 0.1 years is found, compatible with the 5-6 year periodicities detected at radio and optical wavelengths. It is plausible that a supermassive black hole binary system in the nucleus of AO 0235+164 drives the parsec-scale jet precession and induces nodding motions consistent with short-term continuum periodicities. Nonetheless, alternative scenarios (e.g., intrinsic curved jet, warped accretion disc instabilities, Lense-Thirring/Bardeen-Petterson effects, dual jets) cannot be ruled out as causes or optional explanations for the precession.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the past 15 years, the evidence has clearly demonstrated that massive black hole (MBH) binary merger timescales depend strongly on the structural and kinematic properties of their host galaxy. Stellar density, gas content, shape and kinematics all play a role, combining in non-linear ways to effect the evolution of the binary. The binary properties themselves, such as eccentricity, mass ratio, and orbital plane, all matter as well. This makes it nontrivial to estimate accurate cosmological MBH binary merger rates, or to generate merger rate ranges that reflect the distribution of galaxy hosts and orbits. Using an extensive set of high-resolution direct N-body simulations in which the shape, structure, and kinematics of each galaxy host are directly informed by observations, we map out MBH binary merger timescales over a range of galaxy hosts and MBH binary orbits. This yields a convenient set of scaling relations to determine MBH binary merger timescales -- and the range of merger timescales -- as functions of basic observables. Such scaling relations can be readily employed as a subgrid model in cosmological or semi-analytic studies, for example, to model event rates for LISA or pulsar timing.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) reveal young massive clusters (YMCs) as key building blocks of early galaxies. They are not only important constituents of galaxies, but also potential birthplaces of very massive stars (VMSs) and black hole (BH) seeds. We explore stellar dynamics in extremely dense clusters with initial half-mass densities of $\rho_h \gtrsim 10^8M_\odot{\rm pc}^{-3}$ at very low metallicity, comparable to some of the densest clusters seen by JWST. Using direct N-body and Monte Carlo simulations with stellar evolution, we show that VMS formation through collisions is unavoidable, with final masses reaching $5\times10^3$ to $4\times10^4M_\odot$. These results support the existence of a critical mass scale above which collisions become highly efficient, enabling the formation of VMSs and intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs). Our models, using nbody6++gpu and MOCCA with updated SSE/BSE routines, show that dense clusters rapidly form VMSs via stellar bombardment. The VMSs then collapse into BH seeds of a few $10^3$ to $10^4M_\odot$ in less than 4 Myr. We identify a critical mass-density threshold beyond which clusters undergo runaway collisions that yield massive BH seeds. For typical YMCs detected by JWST, efficiencies up to 10% are expected, implying BH masses up to $10^5M_\odot$ if formed via collisions. We predict a scaling relation for BH mass, $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)=-0.76+0.76\log(M/M_\odot)$. Frequent VMS formation may also explain the high nitrogen abundance observed in galaxies at high redshift.

 - **Abstract**
 It is now widely established that globular clusters host robust populations of white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes throughout their lifetimes. Within clusters, dynamical processes enabled by stellar densities thousands to millions of times larger than typical galactic environments facilitate interactions involving these stellar remnants that give rise to an array of astrophysical phenomena. In particular, stellar clusters have emerged as an important formation site for X-ray sources, radio pulsars, and merging black hole binaries similar to those recently detected as gravitational wave sources by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA detectors. This article reviews our current understanding of compact objects in globular clusters, discussing current observational evidence, ways these objects influence the dynamical evolution of their hosts, and future prospects.

 - **Abstract**
 Young eruptive stars such as EXors undergo dramatic accretion outbursts characterized by sudden optical brightenings, yet the underlying physical mechanism remains uncertain. We present high-resolution ALMA Band 3 and 4 continuum observations of EX Lupi, the prototypical EXor-type variable, reconstructed using super-resolution imaging with sparse modeling. Our images reveal, for the first time, two distinct substructures: a compact, crescent-shaped inner arc within 10 au of the star, and a narrow outer ring at 30 au. The inner arc is strongly elongated and casts a shadow observed in the VLT/SPHERE near-infrared scattered light. The outer ring exhibits a radial width comparable to the local pressure scale height, consistent with moderately efficient dust trapping. Geometric and thermal analysis of the disk surface, based on combined ALMA and SPHERE data, indicates that the disk is moderately flared with an average disk temperature consistent with that of classical T Tauri disks. The observed substructures suggest dynamical perturbations-plausibly induced by a massive companion-that may modulate accretion rates through gravitational interaction with the inner arc. These findings provide morphological evidence linking disk substructure to episodic accretion in the structurally mature disk.

#### Breaking the Baryon Density$\unicode{x2013}$Hubble Constant Degeneracy in Fast Radio Burst Applications with Associated Gravitational Waves

 - **Abstract**
 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a unique probe of the cosmos, owing to dispersion caused by free electrons in the intergalactic medium (IGM). Two of the main quantities of interest are degenerate: the density of matter $\Omega_\mathrm{b}f_\mathrm{d}$ outside of galaxies and the Hubble constant $H_0$. Here, we present a new possibility of breaking the degeneracy without invoking early Universe priors on $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$. Assuming some FRBs originate in compact object mergers, the combination of dispersion and luminosity distance from the gravitational wave (GW) can be used to measure $\Omega_\mathrm{b}h^2f_\mathrm{d}$ (where $h$ is the dimensionless Hubble constant). We show that this measurement can be combined with the abundant FRBs that have a redshift measurement. This combination breaks the degeneracy with the Hubble constant. We develop a Bayesian framework and forecast that third-generation GW detectors are required to obtain meaningful constraints. We forecast that one year of Einstein Telescope operations can constrain $H_0$ to $\pm 6\,\mathrm{km}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{b}h^2f_\mathrm{d}$ to $^{+0.0015}_{-0.0016}$ (68$\,\%$ credible interval). The method can also be used with luminosity distances obtained through other means than GWs.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the description of the instruments and the first results of the PRime-focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment (PRIME). PRIME is the first dedicated near-infrared (NIR) microlensing survey telescope located at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in Sutherland, South Africa. Among its class, it offers one of the widest fields of view in the NIR regime. PRIME's main goals are (1) To study planetary formation by measuring the frequency and mass function of planets. In particular, we compare results from the central Galactic bulge (GB), accessible only in the NIR by PRIME, with those from the outer GB by optical surveys. (2) To conduct concurrent observations with NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space telescope. Due to the different lines of sight between the ground and space, we detect slight variations in light curves, known as ``Space-based parallax." This effect allows us to measure the mass of lens systems and their distance from the Earth. It is the only method to measure the mass of the free-floating planets down to Earth-mass. We begin the GB survey in February 2024 and analyzed images through June 1, 2025, identifying 486 microlensing candidates and over a thousand variable stars, including Mira variables, which are useful to study the Galactic structure. We issue real-time alerts for follow-up observations, supporting exoplanet searches, and the chemical evolution studies in the GB. During the off-bulge season, we conduct an all-sky grid survey and Target of Opportunity (ToO) observations of transients, including gravitational wave events, gamma-ray bursts, and other science.

#### Anisotropic Neutrino Emission from Spinning, Moving, and Charged Primordial Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 The angular and spectral features of neutrinos emitted from primordial black holes (PBHs) carry key imprints of the black hole's fundamental properties. This work investigates the directional emission of neutrinos from Kerr-Newman PBHs undergoing Hawking evaporation, accounting for the combined effects of spin, motion, and electric charge. Rotation induces anisotropic fluxes through axisymmetric geometry and spin-dependent greybody factors, while relativistic motion leads to pronounced Doppler beaming along the direction of travel. Electric charge modifies the thermodynamic evolution and suppresses the emission of like-charged particles, altering the overall spectrum and burst duration. The resulting neutrino flux exhibits rich angular structure, energy dependence, and time profiles that vary with PBH parameters. These directional signatures enhance the prospects for detection at current and future neutrino observatories, and offer new multi-messenger probes of PBH populations in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Phase transitions in the early Universe give rise to effective masses for massless fields in the symmetry-broken phase. We use the lattice simulations to investigate the impact of a spectator scalar field with mass generation on the dynamics of first-order phase transitions and the generation of gravitational waves. In addition to the well-known friction effects, we identify a novel effect that significantly enhances the strength of first-order phase transitions. The amplitude of the mass-acquiring field is highly suppressed in the true vacuum bubbles, resulting in additional release of vacuum energy that concentrate on the bubble walls. We also establish an analytical method to explain our numerical results.

 - **Abstract**
 While pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have reported evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB), the detection of continuous gravitational waves (GWs) from a confirmed supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) would provide strong support for the SMBHB origin of GWB. In this study, we analyze continuous GWs from the SMBHB candidate 3C 66B, modeling the GWB as a common uncorrelated red noise. Using Bayesian methods, we perform targeted searches across two PTA data sets: Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves 15 years data set and the European Pulsar Timing Array DR2 full data set. We find no evidence of such signal in both data sets and then place upper limits on the amplitude of the signal and the chirp mass of the source. Additionally, we evaluate the case of a GWB characterized by Hellings-Downs correlations using a likelihood reweighting method, which consistently reconfirms the conclusion of non-detection.

#### Little Red Dots as Direct-collapse Black Hole Nurseries

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope recently uncovered a population of massive black holes (BHs) in the first billion years after the Big Bang. Among these high-redshift BH candidates, observations have identified a class of active galactic nuclei candidates, dubbed Little Red Dots (LRDs), with extraordinarily compact gas reservoirs and peculiar spectral features. LRDs clearly emerge at redshift z<8 and their abundance declines by z<5. Recent theoretical studies have explored the link between LRDs and the formation of heavy BH seeds in the early Universe, such as direct-collapse BHs (DCBHs). Here we present results from preliminary runs for the MELIORA cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, where we implement an accurate model for DCBH formation, accounting for the Lyman-Werner radiation field and mass-inflow rates in the target host haloes. We aim to test whether or not DCBH formation could lead to systems resembling those hypothesized for LRDs. We find that the population of newly formed DCBHs in the simulations exhibits a steep decline at z<6, akin to the emergence of LRDs, primarily driven by reduced inflows. The birth of DCBHs is associated with a significant gas compaction event, followed by a phase of intense luminosity in the 200 Myr after their birth, and subsequently by the formation of the first PopIII stars in these very haloes. If these DCBHs nurseries are associated with LRDs, then it could explain their weak emission from X-rays and hot dust.

#### Scalar induced gravitational waves in PV symmetric teleparallel gravity with non-minimally coupled boundary term

 - **Abstract**
 The question of whether the parity violation occurs in gravitational interaction has recently attracted much attention. In this paper, we investigate the scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in symmetric teleparallel gravity incorporating a parity-violating (PV) term and a non-minimally coupled boundary term. The presence of this non-minimally coupled boundary term help to avoid the strong coupling problem inherent in PV symmetric teleparallel gravity, thereby enabling our study of the SIGWs in this PV symmetric teleparallel gravity. We calculate the SIGWs generated during the radiation-dominated era and compute the corresponding energy density spectrum with a monochromatic primordial power spectrum, numerically. The resulting energy density spectrum of SIGWs exhibits significant deviations from that is predicted by general relativity, particularly at high frequencies. This different feature is detectable by future space-based GW detectors like LISA, TianQin and Taiji.

 - **Abstract**
 We have explored the possibility of the co-existence of two forms of dark energy in the form of an alternative Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG) along with a scalar field of field theoretic or extra dimensional origin in the background of a fractal universe. The essential physical model parameters have been computed and their variations have been plotted. Fractal cosmology in an universe dominated by the alternative GCG (overcoming the drawbacks of the conventional form of GCG) has also been studied by computing the equation of state, deceleration and statefinder parameters. Their variations with the redshift have also been studied. We have tried to construct alternative cosmological models deviating from standard cosmology that can be put to observational testing.

#### Apparent horizon and causal structure of spacetime singularities

 - **Abstract**
 A major issue in general relativity and blackhole physics today is to determine the conditions when the spacetime singularities forming as end-states of gravitational collapse are visible to external observers, and when these are hidden within the event horizon of a black-hole. We show here that such a causal structure of singularity, in terms of its visibility or otherwise, is determined by the dynamics of the apparent horizon and trapped surfaces forming during collapse of massive matter clouds. It turns out that the relative timing of formation of trapped surfaces and the singularity plays a crucial role here. The dynamics of apparent horizon governs the visibility of singularity, and we characterize precise conditions here for spherically symmetric collapse with a general type-I matter field. This is done in terms of the existence of outgoing null geodesic families from the central singularity. These results hold under generic initial data satisfying $\mathcal{C}^2$ regularity and the weak energy condition.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, the behavior of a rotating relativistic kinetic gas surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole is studied. We are interested in the description and the analysis of the morphology of the resulting configurations for a kinetic gas cloud with and without total angular momentum, and we also compare the macroscopic observables with configurations of finite total mass. A collisionless gas in the Schwarzschild spacetime background is analyzed, considering models of the one-particle distribution function depending on the polytropic ansatz and the inclination angle of the orbits of the particles in the kinetic gas. Profiles of the macroscopic observables of the gas configurations are presented, which are derived from the density current vector field and energy-momentum-stress tensor.

#### Black Hole Mass/Charge Relation and Weak No-hair Theorem Conjecture

 - **Abstract**
 We consider Einstein gravity minimally coupled to two Maxwell fields and one dilaton scalar. We study the electrically-charged spherically-symmetric and static solutions that are asymptotic to Minkowski spacetime. General solutions are described by four independent parameters: mass $M$, two electric charges $(Q_1,Q_2)$ and the scalar charge $\Sigma$. For black holes, the scalar charge is not independent, but a function of $(M,Q_1,Q_2)$. We provide a set of formulae relating the mass to the charges, which allows us to determine $\Sigma(M,Q_1,Q_2)$ without having to solve the black hole equations. Our results confirm the weaker version of the no-hair theorem conjecture: scalars can be turned on in a black hole, but they do not have continuous independent hairy parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Euclidean wormholes are known to encode important non-perturbative effects in the physics of quantum black holes. In this paper, we discuss the slicing of Euclidean wormholes along a time-reflection symmetric slice which treats half of the Euclidean geometry as a gravitational machinery to produce a semi-classical state. This type of state preparation is different from Hartle-Hawking states prepared with the CFT path integral, such as the thermofield-double state. Nevertheless, the two different types of states have order one overlaps provided the gravitational data agrees on the initial data slice. This raises an interesting puzzle: one can easily construct an infinite family of semi-classical states that have order one overlap with the thermofield double state, while having a very different Euclidean preparation. We provide a microscopic description of wormhole states in the dual CFT and reformulate the factorization puzzle in the language of entanglement and the Hilbert space.

 - **Abstract**
 Low-energy effective theories provide the natural description of four-dimensional physics in higher-dimensional geometries, where the imprint of the bulk appears as parameters of the lower dimensional theory. Motivated by the recent progress in the first-order thermodynamic formulation of modified gravity theories, we investigate the thermodynamics of effective theories in braneworld scenarios and thereby the attractor mechanism towards general relativity in such theories. We consider the two-brane Randall-Sundrum model where the low-energy theory on either brane is of scalar-tensor nature with the extra-dimensional radion playing the role of the scalar. We study the thermodynamic implications of a non-vanishing gravitational contribution to the radion potential, and further explore the dynamics in the presence of a bulk stabilizing field.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic investigation of the thermodynamic topology for a broad class of asymptotically charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theories, examining how scalar coupling parameters and spacetime dimensions influence black hole thermodynamics. Employing a topological approach that utilizes the torsion number of vector fields constructed from the generalized free energy, we characterize black hole states as topological defects within the thermodynamic parameter space. Through analytical solutions spanning dimensions $d = 4$, $d=5$, and $d=6$, including the Gubser-Rocha model, we demonstrate that variations in the dilaton coupling constant $\delta$, particularly near its critical value $\delta_c$, induce transitions between distinct thermodynamic topological phases. Our analysis reveals that certain black hole solutions constitute a novel class designated as $W^{0-\leftrightarrow 1+}$, characterized by a torsion number $W = 1$ that corresponds to a unique stability structure. We establish that Gubser-Rocha models belong to this topological classification. These results significantly expand the existing classification framework while reinforcing thermodynamic topology as a robust analytical tool for probing the universal properties of black holes in both gravitational and holographic contexts. The findings provide new insights into the relationship between microscopic couplings and macroscopic thermodynamic behavior in extended gravity theories.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the thermodynamics and phase structure of a deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole, generated via the gravitational decoupling (GD) method as a minimal geometric deformation. In the bulk canonical ensemble, our results exhibit a van der Waals-type first-order phase transition in addition to the Hawking-Page transition, in the suitable parameter regime. Further, we compute the critical exponents characterising the bulk transition, confirming their consistency with mean-field theory predictions. Exploiting the exact holographic dictionary between extended black hole thermodynamics and the dual conformal field theory (CFT), we extend this analysis to the boundary and uncover a rich array of phase transitions and critical phenomena across three distinct thermodynamic ensembles. In particular, for an ensemble of fixed volume and central charge, the dual CFT displays a van der Waals-like phase structure. Throughout, we emphasise the pivotal influence of the GD deformation parameter on the thermodynamic behaviour, and we elucidate its role in the confinement-deconfinement transitions characteristic of the deformed AdS-Schwarzschild geometry.
