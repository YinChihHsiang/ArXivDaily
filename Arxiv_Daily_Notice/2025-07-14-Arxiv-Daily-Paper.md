#### Tidal Disruption Event Demographics in Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Over Cosmic Times

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) offer a unique probe of supermassive black hole (SMBH) demographics, but their observed rates remain difficult to reconcile with standard single-SMBH models. In this work, we use simulations of SMBH binaries, including the combined effects of eccentric Kozai-Lidov oscillations and two-body relaxation, to explore how TDE rates scale with SMBH mass and redshift. We find that binary systems exhibit increasing TDE rates with mass, in contrast to the declining trend expected for single SMBHs. These binary-driven rates match those observed in post-starburst galaxies, suggesting that a subset of TDE hosts may contain SMBH binaries. TDE light curves in some massive galaxies exhibit unexpectedly short durations, suggesting that the disrupting SMBH may be less massive than implied by host galaxy scaling relations, consistent with disruptions by the less massive black hole in a binary. By convolving our mass-dependent rates with the SMBH mass function, we predict redshift-dependent TDE rates, which we show can be used to constrain the supermassive black hole binary fraction. Our results provide a testable framework for interpreting TDE demographics in upcoming wide-field surveys such as LSST and Roman.

 - **Abstract**
 Line broadening and variability are observational hallmarks of active galactic nuclei which allow us to measure supermassive black hole masses as well as constrain the geometry and kinematics of the emitting gas, with the most precise measurements requiring a degree of modeling. Two popular models of the broad-line region describe the emitting gas as either a distribution of puffed up clouds or a thin disk with strong velocity gradients. As we show in this work, key features in the reverberation mapping dataset obtained by the AGN STORM team in NGC 5548 cannot be accounted for by either simple model. In several emission lines the observed broad-line profile has a single peak yet the delay profile has a distinct double peak, strongly motivating a BLR with emission from multiple components. We demonstrate a few possibilities that may alleviate the tension and better represent the true nature of the broad-line emitting gas in NGC 5548 and beyond.

 - **Abstract**
 Mergers of compact objects, binary black holes and mergers including at least one neutron star, are a predicted source of high-energy neutrinos. These astrophysical events are now routinely detected through observation of their gravitational wave signature and, at least in one instance, their electromagnetic counterparts were also detected. Particles accelerated during the coalescence of compact objects may also interact to produce high-energy neutrinos, which have yet to be detected, but observations are ongoing. The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration publicly releases information on candidate gravitational wave events from compact binary coalescences in low latency during the current observing run (O4). To aid the electromagnetic follow-up, using data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we search, in real time, for neutrinos spatially and temporally coincident with these gravitational wave candidate events using a time window of 1000 seconds centered on the merger time. We use two methods, both of which have been previously used to search for neutrino emission from gravitational-wave transients: an unbinned maximum likelihood analysis applied to significant alerts and a Bayesian analysis with astrophysical priors, applied to both significant and low-significance alerts. In addition, we search for long-duration neutrino emission up to 14 days after the merging of binaries containing a neutron star. We report analysis results determined in real time for these searches, and set upper limits on both flux and isotropic-equivalent energy emitted in neutrinos.
#### BASS XLVIII: [Ne v] λ3427 Emission in Powerful Nearby Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the high-ionization, narrow [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 emission line in a sample of over 340 ultrahard X-ray (14-195 keV) selected Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) drawn from the BASS project. The analysis includes measurements in individual and stacked spectra, and considers several key AGN properties such as X-ray luminosity, supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, Eddington ratios, and line-of-sight column density. The [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 line is robustly detected in ~43% (146/341) of the AGN in our sample, with no significant trends between the detection rate and key AGN/SMBH properties. In particular, the detection rate remains high even at the highest levels of obscuration (>70% for log[N_H/cm^-2] > 23). On the other hand, even some of our highest signal-to-noise spectra (S/N > 50) lack a robust [Ne v] detection. The typical (median) scaling ratios between [Ne v] line emission and (ultra-)hard X-ray emission in our sample are log L[Ne v]/L(14-150 keV) = -3.75 and log L[Ne v]/L(2-10 keV) = -3.36. The scatter on these scaling ratios, of ~0.5 dex, is comparable to, and indeed smaller than, what is found for other commonly used tracers of AGN radiative outputs (e.g., [O III] $\lambda$5007). Otherwise, we find no significant relations between the (relative) strength of [Ne v] and the basic AGN/SMBH properties under study, in contrast with simple expectations from models of SMBH accretion flows. Our results reaffirm the usability of [Ne v] as an AGN tracer even in highly obscured systems, including dual AGN and high redshift sources.

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical models predict that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) exist in globular clusters (GCs), but observational evidence remains elusive. Millisecond pulsars (MSPs), which are abundant in GCs and have served as precise probes for gravitational waves (GWs), offer a unique opportunity to detect potential IMBH binaries in GCs. Here, we consider the possibility of using multiple MSPs in a GC to form a miniature pulsar timing array (PTA), so as to take advantage of their correlated timing residuals to search for potential IMBH binaries in the same cluster. Our semi-analytical calculations reveal that nearby IMBH binaries around MSPs in GCs could induce microsecond-level timing residuals. In GCs like $\omega$ Centauri and M15, favorable configurations are found which could lead to the detection of binaries with mass ratios $q\gtrsim0.1$ and orbital periods of a few days. We estimate that future higher-precision timing programs could achieve $100$-nanosecond sensitivity, substantially expanding the searchable parameter space and establishing mini-PTAs as powerful detectors of IMBHs.
#### GW231123: a Binary Black Hole Merger with Total Mass 190-265 $M_{\odot}$

 - **Abstract**
 On 2023 November 23 the two LIGO observatories both detected GW231123, a gravitational-wave signal consistent with the merger of two black holes with masses $137^{+22}_{-17}\, M_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52}\, M_\odot$ (90\% credible intervals), at luminosity distance 0.7-4.1 Gpc and redshift of $0.39^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$, and a network signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim$22.5. Both black holes exhibit high spins, $0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and $0.80^{+0.20}_{-0.51}$ respectively. A massive black hole remnant is supported by an independent ringdown analysis. Some properties of GW231123 are subject to large systematic uncertainties, as indicated by differences in inferred parameters between signal models. The primary black hole lies within or above the theorized mass gap where black holes between 60-130 $M_\odot$ should be rare due to pair instability mechanisms, while the secondary spans the gap. The observation of GW231123 therefore suggests the formation of black holes from channels beyond standard stellar collapse, and that intermediate-mass black holes of mass $\sim$200 $M_\odot$ form through gravitational-wave driven mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) play a crucial role in galaxy evolution by influencing the observational properties of their host galaxies. We investigate the host galaxy properties of X-ray selected AGNs, focusing on differences between obscured and unobscured AGNs, and between high-(log([OIII]5007/H$\beta$}$>$0.5) and low-excitation sources (log([OIII]5007/H$\beta$$<$0.5). We selected a sample of AGNs from the spectroscopic zCOSMOS survey with 0.5 $< zsp <$ 0.9 based on the Mass-Excitation (MEx) diagram and X-ray emission. AGNs were classified as obscured or unobscured using hydrogen column density, and as high- or low-excitation based on the [OIII]5007/H$\beta$ ratio. We analysed various AGN properties, including the hardness ratio, X-ray luminosity, emission line ratios such as the ionisation-level sensitive parameter O32=log([OIII]5007/[OII]3727), and the metallicity sensitive parameter R23=log(([OIII]5007+[OII]3727/H$\beta$), and the specific black hole accretion rate. Unobscured AGNs exhibit a more evident correlation between the [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 ionisation ratio and X-ray luminosity than obscured AGNs, while high-excitation obscured AGNs reach, on average, higher X-ray luminosities. Furthermore, high-excitation AGNs typically show high values of R23, suggesting low metallicities, similar to that observed in high-redshift galaxies (4 $< z <$ 6). We find a positive correlation between the parameters $\lambda$sBHAR and N$_H$, R23 and O32 parameters. The correlation suggests that AGNs with a high specific accretion rate have not only a higher production of high-energy photons, which ionise the surrounding medium more intensely, but are also usually associated with environments less enriched in heavy elements. These results provide insights into the complex interplay between AGN activity, host galaxy properties, and the role of obscuration in shaping galaxy evolution.
#### How a Klein-Nishina Modified Eddington limited accretion explains rapid black hole growth in the early universe

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of quasars and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) over $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ merely hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang generates tension with the idea of Eddington-limited accretion and pressures the community into exploring the concept of massive black hole seeds and/or super-Eddington accretion. The observation that many black holes have reached supermassive status while obeying the Eddington limit is puzzling as accretion models are not spherically symmetric. We address this issue by illustrating the physics behind a picture of inner disk accretion involving a geometrically thick, hot quasi-spherical flow and argue that such an inner region provides the radiation that instantiates the Eddington limit. Given the energetics of the inner disk edge, we show how the characteristic electron cross-section drops below its Thomson value, allowing black holes to grow rapidly despite being Eddington-limited. Indeed, after implementing a modified cross-section calculated via the Klein-Nishina Formula, we find that SMBH formation time drops by up to $47\%$. In this context, we show how a $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ black hole can form from a seed $10 M_{\odot}$ black hole within $500$ Myr by way of accretion and mergers. While our picture is over-simplified and contrived in a number of ways that we discuss, we suggest that our scenario is interesting in that it offers a solution to two issues at the intersection of astrophysics and cosmology, namely the reason the Eddington limit is obeyed and how some black holes have grown rapidly despite that limit.

 - **Abstract**
 Differences in the values of the Hubble constant obtained from the local universe and the early universe have resulted in a significant tension. This tension signifies that our understanding of cosmology (physical processes and/or cosmological data) is incomplete. Some of the suggested solutions include physics of the early Universe. In this paper we aim to investigate common features of various early universe solutions to the Hubble constant tension. The physics of the early universe affects the size of the sound horizon which is probed with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Within the standard model, the size of the horizon (within limits of current measurements) is affected by processes that could occur between (approximately) 1 day after the Big Bang and the last scattering instant. We focus on simple extensions incorporating Early Dark Energy (EDE) and show how such a model affects the inferred values of the Hubble constant. We compare this model to LambdaCDM models using MCMC analysis, likelihoods over the parameter space and Bayesian evidence. The MCMC analysis shows that EDE leads to a decrease in the size of the sound horizon that is consistent with H0 = 73.56 km/s/Mpc but we also show that MCMC analysis favours increasing redshift and proportion of EDE. The Bayesian evidence favours our EDE model for very narrow, finely-tuned parameter space. The LambdaCDM model used for comparison has good evidence across a wide parameter space. We interpret this as an indication that more sophisticated models are required. We conclude that if the Hubble tension were to be related to the physics of the early universe, EDE could be used as a window to explore conditions of the early universe and extend our understanding of that era.
#### Observation of the Shadows of the Moon and Sun Using the Pierre Auger Observatory at an Average Energy of $7\times10^{17}\,$eV

 - **Abstract**
 The interaction of cosmic rays with celestial bodies such as the Moon or the Sun produces a shadow in the arrival direction distribution of the cosmic rays reaching the Earth. Such deficits from an isotropic flux have been observed by astroparticle observatories below energies of $10^{15}\,$eV. Above this energy, measurements were limited due to the low number of events as a result of the steeply falling cosmic-ray flux with energy. With more than 10.6 million events recorded during 20 years of operation of the Pierre Auger Observatory, we report the first observation of the shadow of the Moon at an average energy of $7\times10^{17}\,$eV with a maximum significance above 3$\sigma$. The shadow is an end-to-end check that the celestial directions are correctly reconstructed from the air shower data, and it is used here to derive the effective angular resolution for this dataset. Additionally, we present the results of a similar study on the shadow of the Sun.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars are characterized by relativistic jets that are closely aligned with our line of sight. This results in relativistic beaming, making blazars among the most luminous extragalactic sources across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma-rays and, potentially, in high-energy neutrinos. We present a comprehensive study of multi-messenger emission from blazar jets powered by magnetic reconnection occurring at varying distances from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). By generalizing previous models, we explore how the emission characteristics depend self-consistently on the spatial evolution of key jet properties, including magnetization, bulk Lorentz factor, and external photon fields (accretion disc, broad-line region, and dusty torus). Using numerical simulations, we examined the impact of the initial jet magnetization, particle acceleration efficiency, jet-to-accretion power ratio, and mass accretion rate on the broadband photon spectra and neutrino emission. Our findings reveal distinct emission regimes characterized by different dominant radiative processes: synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton dominate closer to the SMBH where magnetization is high, while external Compton (EC) processes become significant near the broad-line region (BLR). Neutrino production efficiency is highest upstream of the BLR, driven by enhanced photon target densities from synchrotron and external photons available for photopion interactions, whereas the proton particle distribution is hard. Our model predictions are compared with observations of gamma-ray luminosities and synchrotron peak energies of Fermi-detected blazars, highlighting magnetic reconnection as a potential mechanism driving both electromagnetic and neutrino emissions in astrophysical jets.

 - **Abstract**
 Hubble tension can be alleviated by altering either early- or late-time $\Lambda$CDM. So far, extensive studies have shown that only early dark energy or ad hoc combinations of those two-fold effects can reduce the tension to $3\sigma$ or lower. In this work, we improve the later solution by considering a cascade decaying dark matter sector, where a parent particle produces relativistic dark matter in the early Universe and the dark matter subsequently decays to neutrinos in the late-time Universe. We parametrize this model with four model parameters, carry out a Markov Chain Monte Carlo fit to Planck 2018+BAO+Pantheon data sets, and compare it to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limits, neutrino flux bounds, and Planck and SDSS data about matter power spectra. Within parameter regions reducing the Hubble tension to $3.2\sigma$ and compatible with the existing constraints, the main phenomenological features include a larger $S_{8}\sim 0.84$, smaller $n_{s}\sim 0.95$ and larger matter power spectra relative to the $\Lambda$CDM, which are left for future tests.
#### Low-latency neutrino follow-up combining diverse IceCube selections

 - **Abstract**
 Neutrino observations are crucial for multi-messenger astronomy, but currently limited by effective area and atmospheric background. However, while other telescopes must point their limited field of view, IceCube can perform full-sky realtime follow-up of astrophysical transient sources with high uptime. For this, IceCube uses its Fast Response Analysis (FRA), which can provide results from an unbinned maximum likelihood analysis within tens of minutes of an astrophysical transient. Besides manually selected transient candidates, it also routinely scans areas of the sky compatible with gravitational wave alerts from LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA and the IceCube event singlets most likely to originate from an astrophysical source. Currently the analysis uses TeV muon neutrino candidate events whose signature permits especially precise angular reconstruction, selected and reconstructed at the South Pole and transmitted with low-latency over satellite. Recently, different event selections are also being included in IceCube analyses. These efforts include the follow-up of gravitational wave events with GeV neutrinos detected by IceCube-DeepCore and the observation of the Galactic plane with cascade events produced by all neutrino flavors. If made available on a day-scale latency, these event selections can also be used in FRAs. Moreso, multiple event samples can be combined in a Fast Response Analysis that is sensitive to a broader energy range of a neutrino transient spectrum and ensures the inclusion of all neutrino flavors. We present the analysis method and technical aspects of such an extension of the existing framework. This includes a proposed new pipeline allowing the inclusion of the more computationally-intensive reconstruction methods used by the aforementioned event selections. The extension is validated using example analyses implemented in this framework. (abbreviated)

 - **Abstract**
 The rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) is responsible for the creation of roughly half of the elements heavier than iron, including precious metals like silver, gold, and platinum, as well as radioactive elements such as thorium and uranium. Despite its importance, the nature of the astrophysical sites where the r-process occurs, and the detailed mechanisms of its formation, remain elusive. The key to resolving these mysteries lies in the study of chemical signatures preserved in ancient, metal-poor stars. In this review, we explore r-process nucleosynthesis, focusing on the sites, progenitors, and formation mechanisms. We discuss the role of potential astrophysical sites such as neutron star mergers, core-collapse supernovae, magneto-rotational supernovae, and collapsars, that can play a key role in producing the heavy elements. We also highlight the importance of studying these signatures through high-resolution spectroscopic surveys, stellar archaeology, and multi-messenger astronomy. Recent advancements, such as the gravitational wave event GW170817 and detection of the r-process in the ejecta of its associated kilonovae, have established neutron star mergers as one of the confirmed sites. However, questions remain regarding whether they are the only sites that could have contributed in early epochs or if additional sources are needed to explain the signatures of r-process found in the oldest stars. Additionally, there are strong indications pointing towards additional sources of r-process-rich nuclei in the context of Galactic evolutionary timescales. This review summarizes what has been learned so far, the challenges that remain, and the exciting prospects for future discoveries. The increasing synergy between observational facilities, computational models, and large-scale surveys is poised to transform our understanding of r-process nucleosynthesis in the coming years.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a preliminary catalog of compact binary merger candidates from the ongoing fourth observing run (O4) of Advanced LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, based on an analysis of public alerts distributed through GraceDB as of May 2025. We developed and applied methods to estimate the source-frame chirp mass for each candidate by utilizing information from public data products, including source classification probabilities, sky localizations, and observatory status. Combining our O4 analysis with previous catalogs, we provide updated estimates for the local merger rate density. For sources with chirp mass characteristic of binary neutron stars ($[1, 1.5]\,M_\odot$), we find a rate of $56^{+99}_{-40}$ $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\textrm{yr}^{-1}$. For systems in the expected neutron star--black hole chirp mass range ($[1.5, 3.5]\,M_\odot$), the rate is $36^{+32}_{-20}$ $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\textrm{yr}^{-1}$, and for heavier binary black holes ($[3.5, 100]\,M_\odot$), we estimate a rate of $19^{+4}_{-2}$ $\textrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\textrm{yr}^{-1}$. This work provides an early glimpse into the compact binary population being observed in O4; we identify a number of high-value candidates up to signal-to-noise $\sim 80$, which we expect to enable precision measurements in the future.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic phenomena in the universe, capable of regulating star formation in galaxies via radiative and mechanical feedback. While AGN feedback is well studied in host galaxies, its influence on neighbouring galaxies within the same large-scale environment remains less understood. In this work, we use the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to examine how proximity to AGN affects star formation in nearby star-forming galaxies (SFGs) out to 2 Mpc. A control sample matched in stellar mass and local density allows us to isolate AGN-driven environmental effects, quantified through the $\Delta$SFR offset defined as the difference between a galaxy's star formation rate (SFR) and that of its matched controls. We find a significant and mass-dependent impact where $61\%$ of AGN-adjacent SFGs show suppressed star formation, while $39\%$ exhibit enhancement. Although the overall magnitude of these offsets is modest, the trends are statistically robust and consistent across the population. Suppression is prevalent in massive, gas-poor galaxies in high-mass halos, consistent with thermal feedback inhibiting gas cooling. Enhanced SFRs appear in low-mass, gas-rich galaxies, suggesting AGN-driven compression may locally trigger star formation. These trends emerge despite EAGLE implementing AGN feedback as a single-mode, stochastic thermal process, indicating that such models can reproduce both quenching and triggering regimes. Our findings demonstrate that AGN feedback extends well beyond host galaxies, impacting neighbouring systems in a non-uniform, distance-, mass-, and gas-dependent manner. This non-local AGN influence represents a critical, yet often overlooked, mechanism in shaping galaxy evolution within large-scale structures, bridging high-energy astrophysical processes and cosmic-scale environmental regulation.

 - **Abstract**
 I perform a detailed investigation of the thermodynamic behavior of (2+1) dimensional Banados Teitelboim Zanelli (BTZ) black holes contained within the canonical ensemble framework, utilizing York formalism. A static, non-rotating BTZ black hole is considered inside a finite radius circular cavity maintained at constant temperature. By getting the measure of the Euclidean action, I obtain expressions for thermodynamic parameters including temperature, entropy, energy, pressure, and heat capacity. I confirm the validity of the Bekenstein Hawking entropy law and examine the thermal stability of the system through heat capacity analysis. Furthermore, I identify conditions for a transition of phase to a stable black hole state from hot flat space and explore the density of states from a statistical mechanics perspective. Moreover, I examine JT coefficient and heat engine efficiency for the BH. Together, our results demonstrate the consistency of York approach and highlight it as a robust tool to investigate black hole thermodynamics in lower-dimensional gravity. Keywords: York's cavity formalism, Canonical ensemble, BTZ black hole, Black hole thermodynamics, JT coefficient, Black hole heat engine efficiency.

 - **Abstract**
 The study of unbound binary-black-hole encounters provides a gauge-invariant approach to exploring strong-field gravitational interactions in two-body systems, which can subsequently inform waveform models for bound orbits. In this work, we present 60 new highly accurate numerical relativity (NR) simulations of black-hole scattering, generated using the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC). Our simulations include 14 spin-aligned configurations, as well as 16 configurations with unequal masses, up to a mass ratio of 10. We perform the first direct comparison of scattering angles computed using different NR codes, finding good agreement. We compare our NR scattering angle results to the post-Minkowskian (PM)-based effective-one-body (EOB) closed-form models SEOB-PM and $w_{\rm EOB}$, finding less than 5% deviation except near the scatter-capture separatrix. Comparisons with the post-Newtonian-based EOB evolution models SEOBNRv5 and TEOBResumS-Dalí reveal that the former agrees within 8% accuracy with non-spinning NR results across most parameter ranges, whereas the latter matches similarly at lower energies but diverges significantly at higher energies. Both evolution EOB models exhibit increased deviations for spinning systems, predicting a notably different location of the capture separatrix compared to NR. Our key finding is the first measurement of disparate scattering angles from NR simulations due to asymmetric gravitational-wave emission. We compare these results to SEOB-PM models constructed to calculate the scattering angle of a single black hole in asymmetric systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waveform modeling in self-force theory has reached a mature stage in recent years, with fast and accurate models emerging at both adiabatic (0PA) and first post-adiabatic (1PA) orders in a multiscale expansion. Here, we provide a gauge-invariant 1PA waveform-generation framework that involves no direct calculation of the (gauge-dependent) self-force. To achieve this, we recast the multiscale framework in a pseudo-Hamiltonian form, working on the six-dimensional phase space intrinsic to the multiscale expansion. We characterize the gauge freedom on phase space and show how a localization procedure avoids nonlocal-in time effects in the 1PA dynamics. We find a conservative Hamiltonian structure can be naturally embedded into the complete, dissipative 1PA pseudo-Hamiltonian dynamics, giving rise to natural definitions of the conserved energy, angular momentum, and radial and polar actions. As a byproduct, we clarify that the on-shell value of the conservative Hamiltonian is equal to the mechanical energy historically predicted by the first law of binary black hole mechanics.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a machine learning (ML) framework called $\texttt{TIER}$ for improving the sensitivity of gravitational wave search pipelines. Typically, search pipelines only use a small region of strain data in the vicinity of a candidate signal to construct the detection statistic. However, extended strain data ($\sim 10$ s) in the candidate's vicinity can also carry valuable complementary information. We show that this information can be efficiently captured by ML classifier models trained on sparse summary representation/features of the extended data. Our framework is easy to train and can be used with already existing candidates from any search pipeline, and without requiring expensive injection campaigns. Furthermore, the output of our model can be easily integrated into the detection statistic of a search pipeline. Using $\texttt{TIER}$ on triggers from the $\texttt{IAS-HM}$ pipeline, we find up to $\sim 20\%$ improvement in sensitive volume time in LIGO-Virgo-Kagra O3 data, with improvements concentrated in regions of high masses and unequal mass ratios. Applying our framework increases the significance of several near-threshold gravitational-wave candidates, especially in the pair-instability mass gap and intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) ranges.

 - **Abstract**
 The lack of a positive-definite and conserved energy is a serious obstacle in the black hole stability problem. In this work, we will show that there exists a positive-definite and conserved Hamiltonian energy for axially symmetric linear perturbations of the exterior of Kerr black hole spacetimes. In the first part, based on the Hamiltonian dimensional reduction of 3+1 axially symmetric, Ricci-flat Lorentzian spacetimes to a 2+1 Einstein-wave map system with the negatively curved hyperbolic 2-plane target, we construct a positive-definite, spacetime gauge-invariant energy functional for linear axially symmetric perturbations in the exterior of Kerr black holes, in a manner that is also gauge-independent on the target manifold. In the construction of the positive-definite energy, various dynamical terms at the boundary of the orbit space occur critically. In the second part, after setting up the initial value problem in harmonic coordinates, we prove that the positive energy for the axially symmetric linear perturbative theory of Kerr black holes is strictly conserved in time, by establishing that all the boundary terms dynamically vanish for all times. This result implies a form of dynamical linear stability of the exterior of Kerr black hole spacetimes.

 - **Abstract**
 Standardizing the definition of eccentricity is necessary for unambiguous inference of the orbital eccentricity of compact binaries from gravitational wave observations. In previous works, we proposed a definition of eccentricity for systems without spin-precession that relies solely on the gravitational waveform, is applicable to any waveform model, and has the correct Newtonian limit. In this work, we extend this definition to spin-precessing systems. This simple yet effective extension relies on first transforming the waveform from the inertial frame to the coprecessing frame, and then adopting an amplitude and a phase with reduced spin-induced effects. Our method includes a robust procedure for filtering out spin-induced modulations, which become non-negligible in the small eccentricity and large spin-precession regime. Finally, we apply our method to a set of Numerical Relativity and Effective One Body waveforms to showcase its robustness for generic eccentric spin-precessing binaries. We make our method public via Python implementation in \texttt{gw\_eccentricity}.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, we introduced the Lorentzian-Euclidean black hole, a static and spherically symmetric solution of vacuum Einstein equations that exhibits a change in metric signature across the event horizon. In this framework, the analysis of radial trajectories of freely falling bodies proves that the central singularity can be avoided via a mechanism we interpret as atemporality, which is responsible for the shift of the time variable from real to imaginary values. In this paper, we further explore this model by first examining the behavior of null geodesics. Our investigation requires a set of signature-adaptive coordinate changes that generalize the local Lorentz transformations underlying General Relativity. We find that photon orbits, like their massive counterparts, cannot traverse the event horizon, thereby strengthening the previous result on the impossibility to reach the $r=0$ singularity. Additionally, we discuss the causal structure of the spacetime, provide the corresponding Penrose diagram, and analyze the process of matter accretion in the outer region of the black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that the isentropic absorption of a classical charged test particle is classically forbidden for all 3+1 dimensional stationary, non-extremal, axisymmetric black holes in any diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity. This result is derived purely from the near-horizon geometry and thermodynamic properties of the black hole spacetime, independent of the specific gravitational theory. We further consider the Kerr-Newman black hole in general relativity and analyze within the semiclassical WKB approximation, the conditions under which isentropic absorption may become allowed. Broader implications for the second law and extremality bounds are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 A variety of mechanisms in the early Universe lead to the generation of gravitational waves (GWs). We introduce here a novel source of GWs generated by vacuum fluctuations after inflation. Being gravitons minimally coupled particles, their quantum creation takes place during inflation, but is absent in an unperturbed Universe during the radiation-dominated epoch, since they behave as conformally invariant particles. However, the presence of inhomogeneities breaks the conformal flatness of the metric, allowing scalar metric perturbations to induce the quantum production of gravitons. We compute the resulting GW spectrum from this mechanism for different models of the primordial scalar power spectrum. We find that this GW signal peaks around the GHz frequency range, distinguishing it from other astrophysical and cosmological backgrounds and underscoring the need for detectors sensitive to these high frequencies.

 - **Abstract**
 On January 14, 2025 the LIGO interferometers detected a gravitational wave from the merger of two black holes, GW250114. Using publicly available information, we estimate that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of GW250114 was $\sim 80$. This would make it three to four times louder than any other gravitational wave detected to date. GW250114 therefore offers a unique opportunity to make precise measurements of its source parameters and to test general relativity. In anticipation of its public data release, we analyze a set of simulated signals that have parameters similar to what we estimate for GW250114 and explore what new insights may be gained from this significant event.
