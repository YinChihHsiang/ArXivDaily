#### Revealing evolution of Dark Energy density from observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present a model--independent reconstruction of the normalized dark energy density function, $X(z) \equiv \rho_{\mathrm{de}}(z)/\rho_{\mathrm{de}}(0)$, derived directly from the DES-SN5YR Type~Ia supernova sample. The analysis employs an inversion formalism that relates the derivative of the distance modulus, $\mu^{\prime}(z)$, to the expansion history, allowing the data to determine the shape of $X(z)$ without assuming a specific equation--of--state or dark energy density parameterization. A statistically optimized binning of the supernova sample (using 17 intervals following the Freedman--Diaconis criterion and 34 following Scott's rule) ensures a stable estimation of $\mu^{\prime}(z)$ and a controlled propagation of uncertainties throughout the inversion process. The resulting $X(z)$ remains statistically consistent with a constant value within one standard deviation across the entire redshift range, showing no significant evidence for an evolving dark energy component at present. In a direct comparison among $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and the quadratic $X^2(z)$ parameterization -- where CPL and $X^2(z)$ each introduce two additional free parameters relative to $\Lambda$CDM -- the CPL model attains the best statistical agreement with the data, albeit only marginally and strictly within this restricted model set. These outcomes indicate that current observations are compatible with an almost constant dark energy density ($w \simeq -1$), while the inversion framework remains sensitive to subtle departures that forthcoming high--precision surveys could resolve.

 - **Abstract**
 A significant fraction of compact-object mergers in galactic nuclei are expected to be eccentric in the Laser-Interferometer-Space-Antenna (LISA) frequency sensitivity range, $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}\ \rm Hz$. Several compact binaries detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration may retain hints of residual eccentricity at $10$~Hz, suggesting dynamical or triple origins for a significant fraction of the gravitational-wave-observable population. In triple systems, von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations perturb both the eccentricity and the argument of pericentre, $\omega$, of the inner black hole binary. The latter could be fully \textit{circulating}, where $\omega$ cycles through $2\pi$, or may \textit{librate}, with $\omega$ ranges about a fixed value with small or large variation. We use \texttt{TSUNAMI}, a regularised N-body code with up to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) term corrections, to identify four different families of orbits: (i) circulating, (ii) small and (iii) large amplitude librating, and (iv) merging orbits. We develop and demonstrate a new method to construct gravitational waveforms using the quadrupole formula utilising the instantaneous {\it total} acceleration of each binary component in \texttt{TSUNAMI}. We show that the four orbital families have distinct waveform phenomenologies, enabling them to be distinguished if observed in LISA. The orbits are also distinguishable from an isolated binary or from a binary perturbed by a different tertiary orbit, even if the secular timescale is the same. Future burst timing models will be able to distinguish the different orbital configurations. For efficient binary formation, about $\sim 50$ binaries can have librating orbits in the Galactic Centre.

#### Strong Progenitor Age-bias in Supernova Cosmology. II. Alignment with DESI BAO and Signs of a Non-Accelerating Universe

 - **Abstract**
 Supernova (SN) cosmology is based on the key assumption that the luminosity standardization process of Type Ia SNe remains invariant with progenitor age. However, direct and extensive age measurements of SN host galaxies reveal a significant (5.5{\sigma}) correlation between standardized SN magnitude and progenitor age, which is expected to introduce a serious systematic bias with redshift in SN cosmology. This systematic bias is largely uncorrected by the commonly used mass-step correction, as progenitor age and host galaxy mass evolve very differently with redshift. After correcting for this age-bias as a function of redshift, the SN dataset aligns more closely with the w0waCDM model recently suggested by the DESI BAO project from a combined analysis using only BAO and CMB data. This result is further supported by an evolution-free test that uses only SNe from young, coeval host galaxies across the full redshift range. When the three cosmological probes (SNe, BAO, CMB) are combined, we find a significantly stronger (> 9{\sigma}) tension with the {\Lambda}CDM model than that reported in the DESI papers, suggesting a time-varying dark energy equation of state in a currently non-accelerating universe.

#### Some problems associated with the standardization of the light curve of type 1a supernovae

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the parameters used to standardize the luminosity of Type 1a supernovae in the SALT2 and SiFTO models are strongly dependent on the redshift z. Consequently, when standardized with increasing z, the average absolute magnitudes of Type 1a supernovae are artificially increased. This means that for a given apparent magnitude they are, on average, assigned larger distances than they actually are, creating the appearance of their recession with acceleration and requiring the introduction of the concept of antigravity (dark energy) to explain it. We also show that after standardization, Type 1a supernovae cease to be standard candles. We therefore argue that such a standardization is not suitable for measuring the distances to Type 1a supernovae, and hence the accelerating expansion of the Universe is called into question.

#### The dependence of black hole formation in open clusters on the cluster formation process

 - **Abstract**
 We performed N-body simulations of both individual cluster evolution and subcluster coalescence, demonstrating that cluster evolution and its outcomes strongly depend on the cluster formation process through comparisons of different gas expulsion modes and formation channels. The evolution of star clusters is significantly shaped by the gas expulsion mode, with faster expulsion producing greater mass loss. A broader degeneracy exists among initial cluster mass, gas expulsion timescale, and formation channel (monolithic vs. coalescence), which manifests in both evolutionary pathways and black hole production. In individual cluster simulations, slower gas expulsion enables progressively lower-mass clusters to retain central black holes within the tidal radius. As the gas expulsion mode transitions from fast to moderate to slow, the fraction of high-velocity stars decreases. Variations in gas expulsion mode and formation channel ultimately influence the stellar velocity distribution (within the tidal radius), and thus the expansion speed, which governs both cluster mass loss and black hole retention. Slowly expanding clusters are more likely to retain black holes and multiple systems, making them prime candidates for black hole searches with {\it Gaia}. Our results highlight the crucial influence of early gas expulsion and cluster formation mechanisms on the dynamical evolution of star clusters and black hole production. These factors should be carefully incorporated into the initial conditions of N-body simulations, which necessarily rely on input from the star formation community.

 - **Abstract**
 For accreting black holes (BHs), the lamp-post scenario is a simple and popular model: a hot and point-like corona is located above the black hole, irradiating the accretion disk with hard X-ray radiation, which is believed to be generated by inverse Compton scattering in the corona. Although the lamp-post model successfully explains the disk reflection component, it fails to address the origin of seed photons and the geometry of the hot corona, because this model simplistically treats the corona as a point-like source generating a cutoff powerlaw spectrum. In this paper, we make simulations on a possible physical realization of the lamp-post scenario: the shape of the scattering zone is set to be a cylinder, corresponding to the jet base near a BH. The source of seed photons in this system is assumed to be the multicolor blackbody radiation of the accretion disk. In our simulations, the Compton scattering process is simulated with a custom Monte Carlo program based on the Geant4 package and the disk reflection process is simulated with the xilconv model in XSPEC. Our simulation results have confirmed that the relativistic motion of the jet can weaken or even completely suppress the reflection of the accretion disk, and simultaneously, the Comptonization of disk photons in the jet can still make a major contribution to the observed X-ray spectrum in high energy range. We discuss the implications of our simulation results, in light of the recent observations of a very weak reflection component in the presence of a strong hard X-ray radiation from the outburst of Swift J1727.8-1613.

#### Relativistic reflection within an extended hot plasma geometry

 - **Abstract**
 Reflection of X-rays at the inner accretion disk around black holes imprints relativistically broadened features in the observed spectrum. Besides the black hole properties and the ionization and density of the accretion disk the features also depend on the location and geometry of the primary source of X-rays, often called the corona. We present a fast general relativistic model for spectral fitting of a radially extended, ring-like corona above the accretion disk. A commonly used model to explain observed X-ray reflection spectra is the lamp post, which assumes a point-like source on the rotational axis of the black hole. While often being able to explain the observations, this geometric model does not allow for a constraint on the radial size of the corona. We therefore extend the publicly available relativistic reflection model RELXILL by implementing a radially extended, ring-like primary source. With the new RELXILL model allowing us to vary the position of the primary source in two dimensions, we present simulated line profiles and spectra and discuss implications of data fitting compared to the lamp post model. We then apply this extended RELXILL model to XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data of the radio-quiet Seyfert-2 AGN ESO 033-G002. The new model describes the data well, and we are able to constrain the distance of the source to the black hole to be less than three gravitational radii, while the angular position of the source is poorly constrained. We show that a compact, radially extended corona close to the ISCO can explain the observed relativistic reflection equally well as the point-like lamp post corona. The model is made freely available to the community.

#### Examining a new form of non-standard dark matter using DESI DR2 data

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we propose a non-standard dark matter (NSDM) model in which the equation of state (EoS) of dark matter (DM) is parameterized as $w_{\rm dm} = w_2 a^2$, and this DM model is motivated by the idea that DM must become cold dark matter (CDM) in the neighborhood of the scale factor $a = 0$, which implies that both the EoS of DM, $w_{\rm dm}$, and its derivative with respect to the scale factor, ${\rm d}w_{\rm dm}/{\rm d}a$, vanish at $a = 0$. By incorporating the latest cosmological datasets -- including the Planck2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), together with three independent Type Ia Supernova datasets, namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus sample -- we constrain the $\Lambda w_2$DM, $ww_2$DM, and $w_0w_aw_2$DM models, which are constructed by replacing CDM with NSDM in the $\Lambda $CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM models, respectively. We find that there is a preference for a negative DM EoS at more than the $3\sigma$ confidence level for the data combinations CMB+DESI+Union3 and CMB+DESI+DESY5. Moreover, for all data combinations, replacing CDM with NSDM in the $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM models significantly reduces the probability of violating the null energy condition. Furthermore, both $ww_2$DM and $w_0w_aw_2$DM are favored over $\Lambda $CDM with a significance comparable to that of the $w_0w_a$CDM model.

#### Probing Primordial black holes with the distortion of Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background

 - **Abstract**
 The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), arising from the incoherent superposition of numerous compact binary coalescences, serves as a powerful probe of both astrophysical populations and fundamental physics. In this work, we investigate the influence of gravitational lensing on the SGWB, focusing on primordial black holes (PBHs) as potential lenses. Assuming PBHs as dark matter candidates with a broad cosmic distribution, we show that their lensing optical depth can be significantly enhanced, producing pronounced effects with relative deviations at the 10^-1 level. By systematically varying the PBH mass (M_PBH) and abundance (f_PBH), we demonstrate that the mass predominantly determines the frequency-dependent diffraction features of the spectrum, while the abundance primarily amplifies the overall lensing-induced deviation. Although the SGWB from binary black holes has not yet been observed, our analytical results provide theoretical insight into the possible imprint of lensing on its spectrum and suggest that future detections could offer a novel avenue to constrain dark matter scenarios.

#### Differential topology and micro-structure of black hole in Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg spacetimes with exponential entropy

 - **Abstract**
 Exact black holes in the Einstein Euler-Heisenberg theory are explored with an exponential entropy framework by using the topological current $\Psi$-mapping theory. The topology classes are investigated through the canonical, mixed, and grand canonical ensembles. In particular, the magnetic charge is fixed for the canonical ensemble, whereas the magnetic potential is included for the mixed ensemble and the grand canonical ensemble with maintaining its consistency through the magnetic potential. The topological charges are analyzed for each ensemble through critical points. As a result, it is found that the canonical, mixed, and grand canonical ensembles lead to either $1$, $-1$, or no generation/annihilation points. Moreover, it is shown how temperature and heat capacity depend on the horizon radius in order to verify the stability of a black hole. Furthermore, the behavior of the thermodynamic curvatures of a black hole is investigated through the geometric methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Late-time cosmic acceleration has motivated the exploration of various extensions of general relativity, among which $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$ gravity, based on the non-metricity scalar $Q$ and the trace of the energy--momentum tensor $\mathcal{T}$, has gained increasing attention. In this study, we explore the thermodynamic aspects of $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$ gravity by establishing the first law and generalized second law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon of a flat FLRW universe. By applying the Gibbs relation, we determined the rate of change of the total entropy and assessed the conditions under which the generalized second law remains valid for various choices of $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$. Our analysis focuses on linear, power-law, quadratic trace, exponential, and cross-coupling models, inspired by frameworks such as $f(R,\mathcal{T})$, $f(T)$, and modifications motivated by string theory. Our analysis showed that linear and mildly nonlinear models are generally thermodynamically consistent, whereas strongly nonlinear or interaction-type models require fine-tuned parameters for the generalized second law to hold. The present analysis underscores that thermodynamic considerations serve as effective criteria for assessing the viability of modified gravity models and their relevance to cosmological dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate tripartite quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertain and quantum coherence for GHZ and W states of a fermionic field in the background of a spherically symmetric black hole of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. Two distinct scenarios are analyzed: (i) the quantum memories (held by Bob and Charlie) are near the horizon while the measured particle (Alice) remains in the flat region, and (ii) the reverse configuration. Dimensional dependence is observed: in $d>5$ dimensions, the measurement uncertainty decreases monotonically with increasing horizon radius, while coherence increases; in $d=5$, both quantities exhibit non-monotonic behavior due to distinctive thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, comparative analysis reveals that the W state exhibits higher robustness in preserving coherence, whereas the GHZ state shows greater resistance to measurement uncertainty increase induced by Hawking radiation. Notably, the two scenarios yield qualitatively distinct behaviors: quantum coherence is consistently lower in Scenario 1 (quantum memory near horizon) than in Scenario 2 (measured particle near horizon), irrespective of the quantum state. For measurement uncertainty, the W state displays lower uncertainty in Scenario 1, while the GHZ state exhibits the opposite trend, with higher measurement uncertainty in Scenario 1. These results indicate that the characteristics of different quantum resources provide important insights into the selection and optimization of quantum states for information processing in curved spacetime.

#### Singularity avoidance in black hole interiors by quantum gravity effects

 - **Abstract**
 The quantum nature of the Schwarzschild black hole interior is investigated through the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation. The interior of a static, spherically symmetric black hole is described by the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) metric, which represents a homogeneous but anisotropic cosmology. We derive the Hamiltonian for the gravitational system corresponding to the black hole interior and obtain the associated WDW equation. By varying the gravitational constant as a parameter controlling quantum effects, we examine how the solutions of the WDW equation change with respect to this parameter. In the parameter regime where quantum effects are negligible, we find that the wave packet solutions closely follow the classical trajectory of the black hole interior. On the other hand, as quantum effects are enhanced, the wave packet deviates from the classical trajectory and exhibits behavior suggestive of singularity avoidance. To quantify this behavior, we introduce an appropriate "clock" inside the black hole and compute the time to singularity formation with respect to this clock. The results show that stronger quantum effects lead to a longer formation time, suggesting a tendency toward the avoidance of singularity formation due to quantum gravity effects.

#### Probing thermodynamic phase transitions by dynamics of timelike particle around a magnetic AdS black hole

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13552

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the phase structure of a nonminimal coupled magnetic AdS black hole by connecting its thermodynamic properties with the dynamical behavior of orbiting particles, within the framework of Lyapunov exponent and quasi-periodic oscillation. The analysis of the free energy as a function of the Hawking temperature reveals a Van der Waals-like phase transition, characterized by the coexistence of small, intermediate, and large black hole phases. By examining timelike geodesics corresponding to unstable circular orbits, we evaluate the Lyapunov exponent of the test particles crossing the phase transition and explore its role as dynamical indicator of stability. Furthermore, by perturbing the unstable circular orbit and employing the relativistic precession model, we explore the associated upper and lower quasi-periodic oscillation frequencies. Our findings show that the occurrence of thermodynamic phase transitions induces marked changes in both Lyapunov exponent and quasi-periodic oscillation spectra, indicating that these dynamical quantities can serve as sensitive probes of the underlying thermodynamic phase structure of the black hole.

#### Orbital dynamics and precession in magnetized Kerr spacetime

 - **Abstract**
 We study the orbital structure and precession dynamics of neutral test particles in the magnetized Kerr black hole (MKBH) spacetime-an exact electrovacuum solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations that self-consistently incorporates the curvature effects of an external magnetic field. This geometry allows a unified treatment of gravitational and magnetic influences across weak to ultra-strong regimes. The analysis reveals a critical magnetic field strength above which no circular geodesics, timelike or null, can exist, establishing an upper magnetic bound for orbital motion. For subcritical fields, the photon circular orbit admits two real roots, the outer of which defines an outermost stable circular orbit (OSCO), complementing the conventional innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and confining stable motion within a finite radial domain. Exact expressions for the orbital, radial, and vertical epicyclic frequencies, and their associated precession rates, show substantial deviations from Kerr behavior, including a magnetically induced reversal of periastron precession within a finite radial range. For astrophysically relevant magnetic field strengths, the retrograde precession could be observable at large radii around astrophysical BHs, offering a potential diagnostic of large-scale magnetization. These findings highlight the geometric influence of magnetic curvature on strong-field dynamics, providing a self-consistent framework to interpret quasi-periodic oscillation phenomenology and potential magnetic imprints in precision timing observations of compact objects.

 - **Abstract**
 In extreme/intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (E/IMRIs) embedded in dark-matter (DM) spikes, the secondary black hole can accrete collisionless particles from the surrounding halo. We study how the companion's spin controls this process, and the ensuing back-reaction on the magnitude and direction of the companion's spin vector. We find that higher spin suppresses the mass accretion rate but enhances the accretion-induced torques, driving spin-down and secular alignment of the companion's spin with the orbital plane. Collisionless DM accretion generically imprints a near-universal mass-spin correlation characterized by a spin-evolution parameter $s \simeq 2.8$, much larger than is the case for typical astrophysical environments, and largely independent of the local DM density and the spike slope. The associated spin-down proceeds on astrophysically relevant timescales, thus observations of rapidly spinning IMRI companions would disfavor the presence of dense DM environments, providing constraints complementary to those arising from dynamical friction.

 - **Abstract**
 Noncommutative (NC) geometry provides a novel approach to probe quantum gravity effects in black hole spacetimes. This work explores Dirac quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a deformed Reissner-Nordström black hole, where noncommutativity induces an effective metric with an additional ($ r-\varphi$) component. Employing a semiclassical model equivalent to a NC gauge theory, we investigate the dynamics of massless Dirac fields and calculate their QNM frequencies using the continued fraction method, enhanced by Gauss elimination to address the six-term recurrence relations. Our results demonstrate notable shifts in oscillation frequencies and damping rates relative to the commutative Reissner-Nordström case, exhibiting a distinctive Zeeman-like splitting in the QNM spectrum driven by the NC parameter.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a new family of type IIB supergravity solutions corresponding to states of the D1-D5-P-KKm system that carry the same charges and energy as the non-extremal four-charge black hole and are asymptotic to AdS$_3 \times ($S$^3/\mathbb{Z}_{N_k}) \times$ T$^4$. The solutions consist of static binaries of two extremal D1-D5-P black holes with S$^3$ horizons and charges of opposite signs, held in equilibrium by a topological bubble supporting $N_k$ units of KKm charge. Although dynamically unstable, the spacetimes remain smooth on and outside the horizons. The equilibrium condition discretizes the black hole separation, producing a quantized spectrum labeled by the number of antibranes and antimomenta at the anti-BPS center. Strikingly, the lowest-energy states lie within an energy window smaller than the dual CFT mass gap. We also show that these solutions admit regular finite-temperature deformations, which slightly lift the two black holes above extremality while remaining within the gap. These results challenge the expectation that no states exist within the CFT gap, realizing Impossible States. We discuss two possible resolutions. First, higher-genus corrections to the two-dimensional effective super-JT theory may allow a sparse spectrum of exponentially suppressed states within the gap. Alternatively, quantum corrections could lift these solutions above the gap.

 - **Abstract**
 We study minimal massive gravity with cubic and quartic terms in Compere, Song, and Strominger (CSS) boundary conditions. By employing a semi-product of a Virasoro and a $U(1)$ Kac-Moody current algebra as the asymptotic symmetry algebra, we calculate the entropy of BTZ black holes via the degeneracy of states belonging to a Warped-CFT. Then, we compute the linearized energy excitations using the representations of the algebra $U(1)\times SL(2, R)_{R}$ and demonstrate that the energies of excitations are non-negative at two chiral points in the parameter space.

 - **Abstract**
 As pointed out in recent research, the near extremal black hole entropy with one-loop effect exhibits universal $\log T$ behaviour at sufficiently low temperature. In this paper, we discuss the low temperature quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of four dimensional accelerating black holes with rotation and charges by using the method of Euclidean path integral. The one-loop path integral for the black hole thermal partition function near extremality is dominated by zero modes defined with respect to the extremal background. For the accelerating black holes without rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a direct product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ with warping factors, and the gravitational zero modes contain both tensor and vector types, with the respective contributions to the near extremal black hole entropy being $(3/2)\log T$ and $(1/2)\log T$. While in the presence of rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a twist product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ and the gravitational vector modes are absent. For the accelerating black holes with charges, we also consider the one-loop path integral of the gauge field, where the photon zero modes are found to contribute an additional $(1/2)\log T$ term to the near extremal black hole entropy.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct, for the first time, new static non-extremal five-dimensional black hole solutions (without or with squashed horizons) endowing with four different electric charge parameters in the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity coupled to \emph{three} vector multiplets with a specific pre-potential $\mathcal{V} = STU -W^2U \equiv 1$. When the fourth charge parameter disappears, the solution simplify reduces to the three-charge static black hole solution previously presented in ref. [1], which belongs to the solution to the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity coupled to \emph{two} vector multiplets (also notably known as the $STU$ model). We parameterize the model in such a simple fashion that not only can one easily recover the static three-charge solution but also it is very convenient to study their thermodynamical properties of the obtained black hole solutions in the case without a squashing horizon. We then show that the thermodynamical quantities perfectly obey both the differential first law and integral Smarr formula of thermodynamics. Finally, we also extend to present its generalizations with squashed horizons or including a nonzero cosmological constant.
