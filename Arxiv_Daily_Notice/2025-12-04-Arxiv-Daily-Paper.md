#### A Critical Evaluation of the Physical Nature of the Little Red Dots
 - **Authors:** Kohei Inayoshi, Luis C. Ho

 - **Abstract**
 Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a newly identified class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) uncovered by JWST deep surveys. Their enigmatic properties challenge the canonical AGN paradigm and have stimulated ideas on early massive black hole (BH) formation. In this review, we summarize how early BHs shape the characteristic features of LRDs, how their nuclear environments differ from those of normal AGNs, and how future observations can distinguish between competing scenarios. Our main conclusions are as follows: (1) LRDs show broad-line emission consistent with mass accretion onto BHs with $M_{\rm BH}\simeq 10^{6-7}~M_\odot$, suggesting that AGN activity is a plausible origin of their dominant red optical emission. (2) Stellar components can reproduce the continuum energetics through dusty star formation. However, the required stellar mass would be too large to remain consistent with other LRD properties. Therefore, a purely stellar origin is unlikely to be the dominant power source, although star formation may still contribute to the UV emission. (3) The coexistence of broad-line emission with Balmer absorption and break features on LRD spectra, neither of which can be explained by stellar populations, suggests that nuclear BHs are enshrouded by dense gas with a high covering fraction. (4) Gas-enshrouded AGNs can produce red optical spectra without requiring dust reddening through a combination of gas attenuation and thermal self-emission with an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}\simeq 5000~{\rm K}$, which also accounts for the flat infrared continuum. (5) From the spectral features and redshift evolution, LRDs are likely a transient phase in early BH growth, possibly the first accretion episodes of newborn BHs. (6) Testing models for LRD spectra and origins through time variability, ionizing sources, post-LRD objects, and low-redshift analogs is particularly promising.

#### The DREAMS Project: Disentangling the Impact of Halo-to-Halo Variance and Baryonic Feedback on Milky Way Dark Matter Density Profiles

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical searches for dark matter in the Milky Way require a reliable model for its density distribution, which in turn depends on the influence of baryonic feedback on the Galaxy. In this work, we utilize a new suite of Milky Way-mass halos from the DREAMS Project, simulated with Cold Dark Matter (CDM),to quantify the influence of baryon feedback and intrinsic halo-to-halo variance on dark matter density profiles. Our suite of 1024 halos varies over supernova and black hole feedback parameters from the IllustrisTNG model, as well as variations in two cosmological parameters. We find that Milky Way-mass dark matter density profiles in the IllustrisTNG model are largely insensitive to astrophysics and cosmology variations, with the dominant source of scatter instead arising from halo-to-halo variance. However, most of the (comparatively minor) feedback-driven variations come from the changes to supernova prescriptions. By comparing to dark matter-only simulations, we find that the strongest supernova wind energies are so effective at preventing galaxy formation that the halos are nearly entirely collisionless dark matter. Finally, regardless of physics variation, all the DREAMS halos are roughly consistent with a halo contracting adiabatically from the presence of baryons, unlike models that have bursty stellar feedback. This work represents a step toward assessing the robustness of Milky Way dark matter profiles, with direct implications for dark matter searches where systematic uncertainty in the density profile remains a major challenge.

#### Cosmology after Phantom Crossing by Horndeski Gravity

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03139

 - **Abstract**
 One possible way to explain the observed effective dark energy equation of state crossing $w=-1$ (the phantom divide) is through modified gravity. A key point is to not view the expansion history in isolation but to take into account the other gravitational impacts on growth of large scale structure, lensing, etc. Within shift symmetric Horndeski gravity this implies three main paths for the late time cosmic expansion. All require unusual kinetic structure and we analyze their various implications for how $w$ should behave after phantom crossing.

 - **Abstract**
 Quasars at the dawn of Cosmic Time ($z>6$) are fundamental probes to investigate the early co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxy. Nevertheless, their infrared spectral energy distribution remains at the present time poorly constrained, due to the limited photometric coverage probing the far-infrared wavelength range where the dust modified black-body is expected to peak ($\sim80$ $\mathrm{\mu m}$). Here we present a study of the high-frequency dust emission via a dedicated ALMA Band 8 ($\sim$400 GHz) campaign targeting 11 quasar host galaxies at $6<z<7$. Combined with archival observations in other ALMA bands, this program enables a detailed characterization of their infrared emission, allowing for the derivation of dust masses ($M_{d}$), dust emissivity indexes ($\beta$), dust temperatures ($T_{d}$), infrared luminosities ($L_{IR}$), and associated star formation rates (SFRs). Our analysis confirms that dust temperature is on average higher in this sample (34-65 K) if compared to local main-sequence galaxies' values, and that this finding can be linked to the increased star formation efficiency we derive in our work, as also suggested by the [CII]$_{158\mu m}$ deficit. Most remarkably, we note that the average value of $T_d$ of this sample doesn't differ from the one that is observed in luminous, ultra-luminous and hyper-luminous infrared galaxies at different redshifts that show no signs of hosting a quasar. Finally, our findings suggest that the presence of a bright AGN does not significantly bias the derived infrared properties, although further high-frequency, high-spatial resolution observations might reveal more subtle impacts on sub-kiloparsec scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurements of peculiar velocities in the local Universe are a powerful tool to study the nature of dark energy at low ($z < 0.1$) redshifts. Here we present the largest single set of $z<0.1$ peculiar velocity measurements to date, obtained using the Fundamental Plane (FP) of galaxies in the first data release (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We describe the photometric and spectroscopic selection criteria used to define the sample, as well as extensive quality control checks on the photometry and velocity dispersion measurements. Additionally, we perform detailed systematics checks for the many analysis parameters in our pipeline. Our DESI DR1 catalogue contains FP-based distances and peculiar velocities for $98,292$ unique early-type galaxies, increasing the total number of $z < 0.1$ FP distances ever measured by a factor of $\sim2$. We achieve a precision of $26\%$ random error in our distance measurements which is comparable to previous surveys. A series of companion DESI papers use the distances and peculiar velocities presented in this paper to measure cosmological parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe the production of the official set of mock catalogs for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Peculiar Velocity Survey (DESI-PV) Data Release 1 (DR1). Our mock catalogs reproduce the Bright Galaxy Survey number density and clustering at low redshift $(z<0.1)$ and the DESI PV samples of Fundamental plane and Tully-Fisher distances, from which we derive peculiar velocities. We carefully match mock and data properties and we mimic measurements of distance indicators and peculiar velocities, which follow the same statistical properties as real data. Mock samples of type-Ia supernovae also complement the other two distance indicators. Our 675 available mock realizations were used consistently by our three different methodologies described in our companion papers that measure the growth rate of structure $f\sigma_8$ with DESI PV DR1. Those mocks allow us to perform precise tests of clustering models and uncertainty estimation to an unprecedented level of accuracy, and compute correlations between methodologies. The consensus value for the DESI DR1 PV growth rate measurement is $f\sigma_8 = 0.450 \pm 0.055$. This sample of mock catalogs represents the largest and most realistic set for cosmological measurements with peculiar velocities to date.

 - **Abstract**
 Joint analysis of the local peculiar velocity and galaxy density fields offers a promising route to testing cosmological models of gravity. We present a measurement of the normalised growth rate of structure, $f\sigma_8$, from the two-point correlations of velocity and density tracers from the DESI DR1 Peculiar Velocity and Bright Galaxy Surveys, the largest catalogues of their kind assembled to date. We fit the two-point correlation measurements with non-linear correlation function models, constructed from density and momentum power spectra generated using 1-loop Eulerian perturbation theory, and validate our methodology using representative mock catalogues. We find $f\sigma_8 = 0.391^{+0.080}_{-0.081}$, consistent to within $1\sigma$ with accompanying analyses of the same datasets using power spectrum and maximum-likelihood fields methods. Combining these growth rate results from different methods including appropriate correlations, we find a consensus determination $f\sigma_8(z = 0.07) = 0.4497 \pm 0.0548$, consistent with predictions from \textit{Planck}$+\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Jointly fitting to this consensus low-redshift growth rate and the DESI DR1 full-shape clustering dataset, we measure gravitational growth index $\gamma_{\rm L} = 0.580^{+0.110}_{-0.110}$, consistent with the prediction of general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 The large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution encapsulate a wealth of cosmological information. A powerful means of unlocking this knowledge lies in measuring the auto-power spectrum and/or the cross-power spectrum of the galaxy density and momentum fields, followed by the estimation of cosmological parameters based on these spectrum measurements. In this study, we generalize the cross-power spectrum model to accommodate scenarios where the density and momentum fields are derived from distinct galaxy surveys. The growth rate of the large-scale structures of the Universe, commonly represented as $f\sigma_8$, is extracted by jointly fitting the monopole and quadrupole moments of the auto-density power spectrum, the monopole of the auto-momentum power spectrum, and the dipole of the cross-power spectrum. Our estimators, theoretical models and parameter-fitting framework have been tested using mocks, confirming their robustness and accuracy in retrieving the fiducial growth rate from simulation. These techniques are then applied to analyze the power spectrum of the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey and Peculiar Velocity Survey, and the fit result of the growth rate is $f\sigma_8=0.440^{+0.080}_{-0.096}$ at effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=0.07$. By synthesizing the fitting outcomes from correlation functions, maximum likelihood estimation and power spectrum, yields a consensus value of $f\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff}=0.07) = 0.450 ^{+0.055}_{-0.055}$, and correspondingly we obtain $\gamma=0.580^{+0.110}_{-0.110}$, $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.301^{+0.011}_{-0.011}$ and $\sigma_8=0.834^{+0.032}_{-0.032}$. The measured $f\sigma_8$ and $\gamma$ are consistent with the prediction of the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter Model and General Relativity.

#### The DESI DR1 Peculiar Velocity Survey: global zero-point and $H_0$ constraints

 - **Abstract**
 The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in its first Data Release (DR1) already provides more than 100,000 galaxies with relative distance measurements. The primary purpose of this paper is to perform the calibration of the zero-point for the DESI Fundamental Plane and Tully-Fisher relations, which allows us to measure the Hubble constant, $H_0$. This sample has a lower statistical uncertainty than any previously used to measure $H_0$, and we investigate the systematic uncertainties in absolute calibration that could limit the accuracy of that measurement. We improve upon the DESI Early Data Release Fundamental Plane $H_0$ measurement by a) using a group catalog to increase the number of calibrator galaxies and b) investigating alternative calibrators in the nearby universe. Our baseline measurement calibrates to the SH0ES/Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, and finds $H_0=73.7\pm 0.06\;(\text{stat.})\pm 1.1\;(\text{syst.})$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Calibrating to surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distances yields a similar $H_0$. We explore measurements using other calibrators, but these are currently less precise since the overlap with DESI peculiar velocity tracers is much smaller. In future data releases with an even larger peculiar velocity sample, we plan to calibrate directly to Cepheids and the tip of the red giant branch, which will enable the uncertainty to decrease towards a percent-level measurement of $H_0$. This will provide an alternative to supernovae as the Hubble flow sample for $H_0$ measurements.

#### A Comprehensive JWST/NIRSpec Census of Broad-Line Active Galactic Nuclei: Faint, Tiny, but Highly Accreting Sources in the Remote Universe

 - **Abstract**
 We present a sample of 252 broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (BLAGNs), incorporating 171 newly identified sources, spanning a redshift interval from $z$ = 0.8 to 7.2. We have analyzed spectroscopic data from the NIRSpec instrument aboard the James Webb Space Telescope, using the G140H, G140M, G235H, G235M, G395H, and G395M gratings to survey N $\sim$ 80,000 galaxies for BLAGNs. Through emission-line fitting, using a sum of Gaussian models for {H$\alpha$}, {H$\beta$}, [N II] $\lambda\lambda6548, 6584$, and [O III] $ \lambda\lambda4959, 5007$, we separate AGN broad-line components from narrow-line emission. We find the detection rate of BLAGNs to be relatively consistent across our redshift range. Compared to typical low-$z$ AGNs ($z$ $\lesssim$ 1), the high-$z$ BLAGNs are systematically fainter and less massive, yet they accrete more efficiently, with most showing Eddington ratios between 0.1 and 1.0. This confirms the rapid black hole growth during the early cosmic epochs. The detection of faint, low-mass BLAGNs at high redshift also helps bridge the observational gap between local supermassive black holes and remote luminous quasars, providing a more complete view of black hole-galaxy coevolution across cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 The effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy provides a model-independent framework for studying cosmology within scalar-tensor theories. In this work, we explore how the time evolution of the cosmological background, inferred from cosmic chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter, can be used to reconstruct the relevant EFT functions. Our approach enables the direct determination of these EFT functions from observational data without assuming any specific cosmological model. This makes it possible to test the background evolution of a wide range of dark energy models, including the $\Lambda$CDM model. We further demonstrate how the reconstructed EFT functions can be applied to constrain concrete theories, such as the quintessence model.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. One of the most important discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the unexpected existence in the Early Universe (z > 4) of very large quantities of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs), compact luminous red galaxies of intriguing physical properties. Aims. We wish to know if LRDs may host accreting Intermediate/Supermassive Black Holes (IMBHs/SMBHs) that may power LRDs, and compare them with the effect of clusters of massive stars. The spectrum of radio emission (synchrotron vs thermal) can be used to know which between these two types of energy sources is the dominant one. Methods. So far LRDs at high redshifts have not been detected at radio wavelengths and it is not known why. Assuming this could be due to their large distances and/or present limitations of observational capabilities, we analyze here archive Very Large Array radio observations of two analog candidates of LRDs in the Local Universe (LLRDs) at redshifts z = 0.1 - 0.2. Results. The LLRD source J1047+0739 at z = 0.1682 is detected at 6.0 GHz in 2018 with the VLA-A of NRAO as a compact source with radii less than 0.2 arc sec (< 600 pc at d = 700 Mpc). Its flux density was 117$\pm$8 $\mu$Jy and its spectral index was -0.85, which is typical of optically-thin synchrotron emission. It is also detected at 5.0 GHz in 2010 with the VLA-C, showing a flux density of 43$\pm$3 $\mu$Jy. Conclusions. The observed flux densities can be provided by a radio luminous supernova. The increase in flux density over eight years can be explained as the result of two independent supernovae or as the radio re-brightening of a single one. Radio time monitoring of this and other LLRDs could help clarify the mystery of the radio silence of its cosmological counterparts.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent results from the DESI collaboration suggest a preference for an evolving dark energy (DE) component rather than a cosmological constant, motivating the exploration of alternative models for the background expansion. These data also reveal tension in the inferred matter density parameter -lower in DESI and higher in Planck- as well as a neutrino mass posterior that approaches the lower bounds permitted by oscillation experiments. In this work, we propose and test a conformal holographic DE (CHDE) model in which the DE density depends on a power law of the conformal time, characterized by an exponent (n). This formulation introduces a single additional parameter relative to LambdaCDM and reduces to it in the limit n = 0. We confront the CHDE model with BAO, CMB, and supernova datasets, following the same combinations used by DESI, and perform parameter inference under both flat and non-flat cosmologies. Our analyses show that LambdaCDM is not favored as the best-fit model when using CMB data alone or in joint analyses including BAO and SNla, and it is disfavored at the 4.4 sigma level for non-flat model and 4.5 sigma for the flat model. We obtain consistent values of n= -0.28 to -0.32 with uncertainties less than +-0.1 across multiple data combinations. Similar to LambdaCDM, the CHDE model predicts a lower matter density when employing DESI data instead of Planck data. This, in turn, influences the neutrino mass constraints, yielding values close to the minimal allowed range. Despite these dataset-dependent tensions, both the flat and curved CHDE models remain compatible with neutrino mass constraints from terrestrial experiments and yield posterior distributions that peaks at positive values. This behavior avoids the issue encountered in the LambdaCDM model, where the posterior peaks at negative mass values.

#### Building a Radio AGN Sample from Cosmic Morning -- The Radio High-Redshift Quasar Catalog (RHzQCat): I. Catalog from SDSS Quasars and Radio Surveys at $z > 3$

 - **Abstract**
 Radio-loud high-redshift quasars (RHRQs) provide crucial insights into the evolution of relativistic jets and their connection to the growth of supermassive black holes. Beyond the extensively studied population at $z \ge 5$, the cosmic morning epoch ($3 \lesssim z \lesssim 5$) marks the peak of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and black hole accretion, yet remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we compiled the radio high-redshift quasar catalog (RHzQCat) by cross-matching the SDSS DR16Q catalog with four major radio surveys -- FIRST,NVSS, RACS, and GLEAM. Our tier-based cross-matching framework and visual validation ensured reliable source identification across surveys with diverse beam sizes. The catalog included 1629 reliable and 315 candidate RHRQs, with radio luminosities uniformly spanning $10^{25.5}$ -- $10^{29.3}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. About 95\% of the confirmed sources exhibited compact morphologies, consistent with Doppler-boosted or young AGN populations at high redshifts. Our catalog increases the number of known RHRQs at $z\ge3$ by an order of magnitude, representing the largest and most homogeneous catalog of radio quasars at cosmic morning, filling the observational gap between the early ($z>6$) and local Universe. It provides a robust reference for future statistical studies of jet evolution, AGN feedback, and cosmic magnetism with next-generation facilities such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA).

 - **Abstract**
 Large-scale magnetic fields are relevant for a number of dynamical processes in accretion disks, including driving turbulence, reconnection events, and launching outflows. Numerical simulations have indicated that the initial strengths and configurations of the large-scale magnetic fields have a direct imprint on the outcome of an accretion disk evolution. To facilitate future self-consistent simulations that include intrinsic dynamo processes, we derive and implement a subgrid model of a helical large-scale dynamo with dynamical quenching in general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamical simulations of geometrically thin accretion disks. By incorporating previous numerical and analytical results of helical dynamos, our model features only one input parameter, the viscosity parameter $\alpha_\text{SS}$. We demonstrate that our model can reproduce butterfly diagrams seen in previous local and global simulations. With rather aggressive parameter choice of $\alpha_\text{SS}=0.02$ and black hole spin $a_\text{BH}=0.9375$, our thin-disk model launches weak collimated polar outflows with Lorentz factor $\simeq 1.2$, but no polar outflow is present with less vigorous turbulence or less positive $a_\text{BH}$. With negative $a_\text{BH}$, we find the field configurations to appear more similar to Newtonian cases, whereas for positive $a_\text{BH}$, the poloidal field loops become distorted and the cycle period becomes sporadic or even disappears. Moreover, we demonstrate how $\alpha_\text{SS}$ can avoid to be prescribed and instead be determined by the local plasma beta. Such a fully dynamical subgrid dynamo allows for self-consistent amplification of the large-scale magnetic fields.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the physical properties of the central engine powering gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), modelled as a stellar-mass black hole accreting via a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF). By solving the governing hydrodynamic equations, we obtain global transonic NDAF solutions featuring shock transitions and examine their role in powering GRB energetics. The NDAF solutions are explored over a broad range of black hole parameters, including its mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and spin ($a_{\rm k}$), and accretion rate ($\dot{M}$). We find that shocked NDAFs can naturally account for the observed diversity in GRB energy output. Incorporating results from numerical simulations of binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers, we estimate the remnant black hole mass and spin parameters for the predicted range of post-merger disk mass ($M_{\rm disk}$). Our analysis reveals that small-mass black holes with relatively low spin values can adequately reproduce the luminosities of short GRBs (SGRBs), whereas identical GRB luminosities can also be achieved for more massive black holes possessing higher spin values. Finally, we uncover a robust correlation between the black hole spin and disk mass such that $M_{\rm disk}$ decreases with increasing $a_{\rm k}$, remaining largely independent of the black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) powering GRBs.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the Compton-rocket effect of multi-photon interacting with electrons in an opaque fireball (or fire spot) of photons and $e^-e^+$ pairs at temperature $T_\gamma\gg m_e$. We find the charged-particle acceleration and the avalanche runaway process, leading to a non-trivial probability of ultra-high-energy (UHE) electrons and protons, which subsequently produce very-high-energy (VHE) photons and neutrinos. We show such peculiar dynamics using the Gamma-Ray Burst central engine fireball, whose inner part inflows and forms a gravitationally trapped fireshell (halo) around a black hole. The halo is a metastable, cooling via UHE particle emissions and blackbody radiation. We calculate the UHE particle luminosity varying in time, and discuss the peculiar features of such produced UHE particles, which lead to VHE particles, in connection with possible numerical simulations, observations and experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the properties of the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM) of massive galaxies and their cosmic evolution. By using the year 1 dataset of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and QSOs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey, we construct a sample of approximately 600,000 galaxy-quasar pairs and measure the radial distribution and kinematics of the cool gas traced by Mg II absorption lines as a function of galaxy properties from redshift 0.4 to redshift 1.2. Our results show that the covering fraction of the cool gas around LRGs increases with redshift, following a trend similar to the global evolution of galaxy star formation rate. At small radii (< 0.3rvir), the covering fraction anti-correlates with stellar mass, suggesting that mass-dependent processes suppress the cool gas content in the inner region. In addition, we measure the gas dispersion by modeling the velocity distribution of absorbers with a narrow and a broad components -- sigma_n ~ 60 and sigma_b ~ 380 km/s -- and quantify their relative contributions. The results show that the broad component becomes more prominent in the outer region, and its relative importance in the central region grows with increasing stellar mass. Finally, we discuss possible origins of the cool gas around massive galaxies, including the contribution of satellite galaxies and the precipitation scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark matter (DM) annihilation can power the first generation of stars as long lived dark stars (DSs) that grow to supermassive scales $M_{\rm DS}\gtrsim 10^{5} M_{\odot}$ and eventually collapse into heavy black holes that could seed the supermassive black holes observed at high redshifts. We compute the diffuse electromagnetic emission from a cosmological population of such supermassive DSs and their black hole remnants, tracking the entire DS history and including thermal surface radiation, DM annihilation in adiabatically contracted halos as well as late-time emission from DM overdensity spikes around the resulting black holes. After accounting for photon attenuation, we find that DS related contributions can exceed the Fermi-LAT extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background for thermal relic annihilation cross-sections and DM masses below $\sim 1$ TeV. Our results constitute the first population integrated diffuse multimessenger constraints on supermassive DSs as progenitors of early black holes and demonstrate that diffuse photon and neutrino backgrounds offer a powerful and complementary avenue for probing the role of DM in the formation of the earliest massive structures.

 - **Abstract**
 The Tomimatsu--Sato (TS) family generalizes the Kerr black hole to higher multipole order $\delta$ and has long been regarded as algebraically complicated without any clear integrability. We show instead that stationary axisymmetric vacuum Einstein equations, when the Ernst potential is written as a $\tau$--ratio $\mathcal{E}=\tau_1/\tau_0$, admit a universal decomposition of the Ernst numerator into a cubic part containing all second derivatives and a quartic \emph{gradient envelope}. The cubic sector can be written in terms of $Z_3$--symmetric trilinear Hirota operators, revealing a hidden integrable structure. For $\delta=2$, using the explicit Tomimatsu--Sato polynomials, we verify that this trilinear sector coincides with a Yu--Toda--Sasa--Fukuyama (YTSF) equation-type kernel. Thus the TS geometry forms a gravitational realization of a multilinear $\tau$--function hierarchy in stationary axisymmetric general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 We have sifted through astrophysical data collected by various radial velocity and gravitational microlensing searches for exoplanets with the goal of identifying potential signs of the presence of primordial black holes (PBH). Our motivation is that those hypothesized remnants of inhomogeneous energetic fluctuations in the early universe, though too small for direct detection, are thought to have a mass range similar to that of planets. Thereby, if captured by stars, they could conceivably make their presence known through stellar wobbles picked up by means of Doppler spectroscopy in the radial velocity method, or alternatively through microlensing. In our analysis of such data, we have identified potential PBH contenders by ruling out any exoplanet candidates that have been detected through direct imaging or transit methods, as they would have sizes consistent with planets rather than PBHs. In particular we focus on the objects Kepler-21 Ac, HD 219134 f, Gliese 686 b, HR 5183 b, HD 20794 e, and Wolf 1061 d, each of which has been found using the radial velocity method but never imaged (either directly or through transit). We also examine the microlensing events MOA 2009-BLG-387L and OGLE-2016-BLG-1540, which offer promise as candidate PBHs. We present these as a representative, but not exclusive list, of potential PBH contenders. Furthermore, future imaging, especially focused on signals of planetary dimensions versus evaporation signatures, might clarify which of these are indeed exoplanets.

#### Inferring black hole formation channels in GWTC-4.0 via parametric mass-spin correlations derived from first principles

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the differences between several proposed formation scenarios for binary black holes (BBHs), including isolated stellar evolution, dynamical assembly in dense clusters and AGN disks, and primordial BHs. Our approach exploits the predicted spin features of each formation channel, and adopts parameterized models of the predicted correlations between the spin magnitudes (and orientations) and mass, inspired by first principles. Using hierarchical Bayesian inference on the recent GWTC-4.0 dataset, we compare these features across all models and assess how well each scenario explains the data. We find that the data strongly favor the presence of a positive correlation between mass and spin magnitude, in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, the hierarchical scenario provides a better fit to the observations, due to the inclusion of second-generation mergers leading to higher spins at larger masses. The current dataset is not informative enough about spin orientation: the cluster (random orientations) and AGN (aligned orientations) scenarios have comparable Bayesian evidence. Finally, the mass-spin correlation predicted by the primordial scenario gives a poor fit to the data, and this scenario can only account for a subset of the observed events.

 - **Abstract**
 We study, for the first time, the evolution of a scalar cloud bound to an evaporating black hole. Our simulations of the associated Schrödinger-Poisson system for non-relativistic and spherically symmetric clouds reveal that a scalar cloud may (partially) survive as a self-gravitating boson star if the black hole evaporates adiabatically until its mass becomes less than one half of the cloud's mass. This yields a novel mechanism for boson star formation and shows that, as previously conjectured, bosonic dark matter production by light primordial black holes may result in micro-boson stars with very large occupation numbers, greatly enhancing their potential detectability even for very weakly interacting dark matter particles.

#### Constraints on Reversing the Thermodynamic Arrow of Time from Black Hole Thermodynamics, Wormholes, and Time-Symmetric Quantum Mechanics

 - **Abstract**
 Can the thermodynamic arrow of time in a single universe be reversed, even temporarily, within semiclassical gravity without invoking additional universes or branches? We address this question in a single, connected spacetime where quantum field theory is coupled to classical general relativity, and where black holes, traversable wormholes, and time-symmetric or retrocausal formulations of quantum mechanics might naively appear to open channels for entropy export or cancellation. After distinguishing fine-grained, coarse-grained, and generalized gravitational entropy, and formulating a cosmological coarse-grained entropy, we treat black hole evaporation, wormholes constrained by quantum energy inequalities, and two-time boundary-value frameworks (including absorber-type and two-state-vector formalisms) within a common information-theoretic language. We then introduce a "Global Entropy Transport" (GET) framework and derive a sectoral inequality that bounds the net decrease of matter-plus-radiation entropy in terms of changes in horizon area and correlation (mutual-information) terms, assuming the generalized second law and modern focusing and energy conditions. Within this framework, black holes, wormholes, and retrocausal protocols can at most redistribute entropy among matter, radiation, and gravitational sectors and reshape the local pattern of entropy production. They do not, under current semiclassical, holographic, and statistical-mechanical constraints, permit a genuine reversal of the universal thermodynamic arrow in a single connected universe.

#### Motion of a charged test particle around a static black hole in a monopole magnetic field

 - **Abstract**
 We study the motion of a charged test particle in the spacetime with a spherically symmetric black hole which is immersed in a monopole magnetic field. We show that the radial motion of the charged test particle is governed by completely the same equation as that in the case of no magnetic field. This result implies that the black hole will acquire the electric charge if it is surrounded by the collisionless plasma composed of protons and electrons which obey the Maxwell velocity distribution. The drastically different situation appears in the tangential motions of charged test particles due to the magnetic field. The trajectory of a charged test particle in the black hole with the magnetic field of the order of 10 Gauss near the black hole, is confined on a very thin cone as long as the specific angular momentum of the particle is not much larger than the gravitational radius of the black hole times the speed of light. This result leads to a possibility that a plasma lump can hover over the black hole and is very hot, in the monopole magnetic field.

 - **Abstract**
 Covariant $f(Q)$ gravity is a viable extension of General Relativity, however its strong-field predictions remain largely untested. Using the static, spherically symmetric black-hole solutions of the theory, we confront it with the most stringent probes available: black-hole shadows, Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements, S2-star precession, and strong gravitational lensing. We show that the two admissible solution branches behave very differently: Case~I produces negligible deviations from Schwarzschild solution, whereas Case~II yields significant, potentially observable corrections to the photon sphere and shadow size. From the EHT shadow diameters of M87* and Sgr~A*, we obtain tight bounds, which are further strengthened by strong-lensing coefficients. These results provide the sharpest strong-field constraints on covariant $f(Q)$ gravity to date, and point toward future tests using next-generation horizon-scale imaging and precision Galactic-center astrometry.

 - **Abstract**
 By solving a nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation in Kerr geometry, we uncover new phenomena and key characteristics of quantized vortices in quantum fluids near a Kerr black hole. The formation of these vortices induces rotational or turbulent flows, which profoundly alter the fluid properties and revise those dark matter models describing axion condensates, ultralight boson clouds, and other scalar fields in the vicinity of spinning black holes. As macroscopic, quantum, and topological defects, these vortices can stably orbit the black hole over extended periods, establishing their viability as novel probes for investigating black hole physics. For instance, we calculate the angular velocities of orbiting vortices to quantitatively characterize the frame-dragging effect, a classic prediction of general relativity. Additionally, we observe that relatively large vortices are accreted onto the black hole, wrapping around it while undergoing splitting and reconnecting processes. In quantum fluids with high vortex densities, turbulent flows emerge, accompanied by the formation of a vortex boundary layer near the event horizon. Beyond the ergosphere, we find vortex emissions and energetic outbursts, which may provide crucial insights into analogous astrophysical events recently discovered by the XRISM satellite.

 - **Abstract**
 The reduction of dynamical systems which are invariant under changes of global scale is well-understood, for classical theories of particles, and fields. The excision of the superfluous degree of freedom describing such a scale leads to a dynamically-equivalent theory, which is frictional in nature. In this article, we extend the formalism to physical models, of both particles and fields, described by singular Lagrangians. Our treatment of classical field theory is based on the manifestly covariant Hamilton De-Donder Weyl formalism, in which the Lagrangian density is introduced as a bundle morphism on the pre-multisymplectic velocity phase space $J^1E$. The results obtained are subsequently applied to a number of physically-motivated examples, as well as a discussion presented on the implications of our work for classical General Relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 We obtain relativistic solutions of spherically symmetric accretion by a dynamical analysis of a generalised Hamiltonian for higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordström (RN) Black Hole (BH). We consider two different fluids namely, an isotropic fluid and a non-linear polytropic fluid to analyse the critical points in a higher-dimensional RN BH. The flow dynamics of the fluids are studied in different spacetime dimensions in the framework of Hamiltonian formalism. The isotropic fluid is found to have both transonic and non-transonic flow behaviour, but in the case of polytropic fluid, the flow behaviour is found to exhibit only non-transonic flow, determined by a critical point that is related to the local sound speed. The critical radius is found to change with the spacetime dimensions. Starting from the usual four dimensions it is noted that as the dimension increases the critical radius decreases, attains a minimum at a specific dimension ($D>4$) and thereafter increases again. The mass accretion rate for isotropic fluid is determined using Hamiltonian formalism. The maximum mass accretion rate for RN BH with different equations of state parameters is studied in addition to spacetime dimensions. The flow behaviour and mass accretion rate for a change in BH charge is also studied analytically. It is noted that the maximum mass accretion rate in a higher-dimensional Schwarzschild BH is the lowest, which however, increases with the increase in charge parameter in a higher-dimensional RN BH.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by integrating the dilaton field (as a UV correction) with dRGT-like massive gravity (as an IR correction) into Einstein gravity, we investigate the thermodynamic and optical properties of black holes within this gravitational framework. We begin by reviewing the black hole solutions in Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity, followed by an analysis of how various parameters influence on the asymptotical behavior of the spacetime and the event horizon of these black holes. In the subsequent section, we examine the conserved and thermodynamic quantities associated with these black holes, paying particular attention to the effects of parameters like $\beta$, $\alpha$, and the massive parameters ($\eta_{1}$ and $\eta_{2}$) on their local stability by simultaneously evaluating the heat capacity and temperature. We also adopt an alternative method to study phase transitions using geometrothermodynamics. Furthermore, we explore how the parameters of Maxwell-dilaton-dRGT-like massive gravity impacts the optical characteristics and radiative behavior of black holes. In particular, we analyze the effects of the dilaton coupling constant ($\alpha$), charge ($q$), the massive gravity parameter ($\eta_1$), and the graviton mass ($m_g$) on the radius of the photon sphere and the resulting black hole shadow. Moreover, the theoretical shadow radius is compared to the observational data from $Sgr A^*$. Additionally, we investigate the energy emission rate of these black holes, revealing that these parameters substantially influence the emission peak.

 - **Abstract**
 In order to explain the late-time acceleration of the Universe, we present a reconstructed version of the $f(Q)$ gravity theory in this work, which is inspired by the integrating the fractional holographic dark energy with the Hubble horizon as the infrared cutoff. This reconstructed $f(Q)$ gravity model shows a geometrically motivated dark energy component and naturally recovers General Relativity in the appropriate limit. The free parameters of the model are constrained using the latest DESI BAO data, previous BAO compilations (P-BAO), and cosmic chronometer (CC) datasets through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. The reconstructed Hubble parameter $H(z)$ exhibits excellent consistency with observational data, with high values of $R^2$ and low values of $\chi^2_{\min}$, AIC, and BIC, confirming the model's strong statistical performance relative to $\Lambda$CDM. With current $q(0) \in [-0.40, -0.32]$ and a transition redshift $z_{\text{tr}} \sim 0.56$--$0.72$, the dynamical diagnostics show a smooth transition from a decelerated to an accelerated phase. While the $Om(z)$ diagnostic exhibits a negative slope, indicating that the model is not $\Lambda$CDM, the effective equation-of-state parameter $\omega_{\text{eff}}(z)$ stays within the quintessence regime ($-1 < \omega_{\text{eff}} < -1/3$). The analysis of classical energy conditions shows that the WEC, DEC, and NEC are satisfied throughout the cosmic evolution, with a violation of the SEC at lower-redshift, which is consistent with late-time acceleration. Linear homogeneous perturbation analysis further confirms the model's dynamical stability. Conclusively, the FHDE-inspired reconstructed $f(Q)$ gravity provides a stable, observationally compatible, and geometrically motivated alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, that successfully describes the late-time cosmic acceleration within the symmetric teleparallel framework.

 - **Abstract**
 Naked singularities are hypothetical astrophysical entities featuring gravitational singularities without event horizons. In this study, we analyze the shadow properties of Kerr Modified Gravity (Kerr MOG) naked singularities (KMNSs). We show that the KMNS shadow can appear closed, open, or even vanish, depending on the dimensionless spin parameter a, the modified gravity parameter alpha, and the observer's inclination angle. We identify the critical conditions under which the KMNS shadow develops a gap, a unique feature not present in BH shadows. We analyze the properties of a thin accretion disk surrounding a KMNS, within the framework of MOG characterized by the parameter alpha. The study includes a detailed examination of the spacetime geometry and the equations of motion for test particles. In addition, we adopt a simplified model for the disk's radiative flux, temperature distribution, and spectral luminosity. Our analysis primarily focuses on the flux distribution of the accretion disk around KMNS with identical mass but varying spin and MOG deformation parameters. This allows us to explore how modifications in rotation and the MOG parameter alpha influence the radiative properties of the disk. Further, these observational signatures may serve as effective tools for clearly distinguishing KMNS from standard Kerr naked singularities (KNSs), where the MOG parameter alpha = 0

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate tensor perturbations in a de Sitter background within the framework of Chern-Simons modified gravity. We introduce transverse-traceless perturbations and analyze how the Chern-Simons Cotton tensor induces parity-violating modifications to gravitational wave propagation, while the Pontryagin density vanishes at linear order. Using a mode decomposition of the scalar background field, we derive the sub- and super-horizon limits of the wave equations and uncover chiral corrections in the dispersion relations of tensor modes. The resulting birefringence exhibits both amplitude and velocity components, alternating with the phase of the scalar field. Particular solutions sourced by the scalar background show helicity-dependent amplification and a characteristic scaling of the radiated flux that reduces smoothly to the Minkowski limit. The accumulated phase difference between right- and left-handed modes grows quadratically inside the horizon and becomes frozen outside, leaving a permanent parity-violating imprint in the primordial tensor spectrum. Finally, by promoting the Chern-Simons field to a massive dark matter candidate, we demonstrate how its mass-dependent dynamics connect gravitational birefringence to axion-like dark matter phenomenology.

 - **Abstract**
 We study black holes in shift-symmetric scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity extended by a cubic Galileon interaction with a distinct energy scale. Introducing this hierarchy profoundly modifies the theory's phenomenology. The cubic interaction allows for smaller black holes, and can generate a screening mechanism near the horizon, making large Gauss-Bonnet couplings consistent with gravitational-wave bounds. Observable quantities such as the scalar charge, the innermost stable circular orbit, and its frequency are most affected for small black holes. The resulting multi-scale effective field theory remains technically natural and offers new avenues to probe gravity in the strong-field regime.

 - **Abstract**
 The scattering equations relate massless scattering kinematics to marked points on a Riemann sphere, and underpin remarkable formulae for the full tree-level S-matrices of many interesting QFTs, including cubic biadjoint scalars, Yang-Mills theory and general relativity. The scattering equations arise from worldsheet correlators of ambitwistor string theories, which has enabled their generalisation to anti-de Sitter (AdS) space in certain cases. In this paper, we use the scattering equations and ambitwistor strings to prove the correspondence between an appropriate flat limit of boundary correlators in AdS and Carrollian scattering amplitudes -- massless amplitudes written in position space on the null conformal boundary -- for any number of external states and spacetime dimensions in tree-level, cubic scalar theories. We first derive the Carrollian version of the scattering equations in Minkowski space and their associated Carrollian amplitude formulae, by direct Fourier transform from momentum space and from ambitwistor strings with a Carrollian basis of vertex operators. We then take the flat limit of known formulae for all tree-level boundary correlators of cubic scalar theories in AdS, recovering the Carrollian amplitudes in flat space. In the special case of AdS$_3$, we also make some comments on the flat space limit of spinning boundary correlators.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a novel effective field theory for a compact body coupled to gravity, whose key feature is that the dynamics of gravitational perturbations is explicitly determined by known solutions in black hole perturbation theory in four dimensions. In this way, the physics of gravitational perturbations in curved space are already encoded in the effective field theory, thus bypassing the need for the higher-order calculations that constitute a major hurdle in standard approaches. Concretely, we model the compact body as a spherical shell, whose finite size regulates short-distance divergences in four dimensions and whose tidal responses are described by higher-dimensional operators. As an application, we consider scalar perturbations and derive new results for scalar Love numbers through ${\cal O} (G^9)$ for Schwarzschild black holes and for generic compact bodies. Finally, our analysis reveals an intriguing structure of the scalar black-hole Love numbers in terms of the Riemann zeta function, which we conjecture to hold to all orders.
