#### A critical analysis of the recent OGLE limits on stellar mass primordial black holes in the halo of the Milky Way

 - **Abstract**
 This paper is a response to recent claims that a population of primordial black holes in the Galactic halo has been ruled out by the OGLE collaboration. This claim was based on the latest results from the OGLE microlensing survey towards the Large Magellanic Cloud which failed to detect even the number of events expected from known stellar populations. In particular, their results are completely inconsistent with the results of the MACHO survey which detected a population of compact bodies in the Galactic halo which could not be accounted for by any known stellar population. The discrepancy between the results of these two groups has a long history, and includes problems such as different choice of photometric passbands, quality of light curves, microlensing event selection, detection efficiency, self lensing and halo models. In this paper it is demonstrated that these issues not only account for the discrepancy between the OGLE and MACHO results, but imply that the OGLE observations can put no meaningful constraints on a population of primordial black holes in the Galactic halo.

 - **Abstract**
 The forthcoming GRAVITY+ instrument promises to usher in an era of "industrial-scale" mass measurements of isolated black holes (BHs), with the potential to assemble a sample of many tens of BHs via interferometric microlensing over several years. A key challenge will be selecting interferometric follow-up targets from an order-of-magnitude larger pool of ongoing microlensing events when using traditional selection based on event timescale alone. Gould (2023) proposed a criterion optimized for BH selection using space-based microlens parallax measurements enabled by a satellite. We adapt it to work with microlens parallax constraints obtainable from ground-based data only. Using Galactic simulations, we show that our selection criterion is highly efficient, expecting to detect about a dozen BHs per year with GRAVITY+ from following up ~35 selected events.

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123, the most massive binary black hole (BBH) merger detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, highlights the need to understand the origins of massive, high-spin stellar black holes (BHs). Dense star clusters provide natural environments for forming such systems, beyond the limits of standard massive star evolution to core collapse. While repeated BBH mergers can grow BHs through dynamical interactions (the so-called "hierarchical merger" channel), most star clusters with masses $\lesssim 10^6\,M_\odot$ have escape speeds too low to retain higher-generation BHs, limiting growth into or beyond the mass gap. In contrast, BH--star collisions with subsequent accretion of the collision debris can grow and retain BHs irrespective of the cluster escape speed. Using $N$-body (Cluster Monte Carlo) simulations, we study BH growth and spin evolution through this process and we find that accretion can drive BH masses up to at least $\sim200\,M_\odot$, with spins set by the details of the growth history. BHs up to about $150\,M_\odot$ can reach dimensionless spins $\chi \gtrsim 0.7$ via single coherent episodes, while more massive BHs form through multiple stochastic accretion events and eventually spin down to $\chi \lesssim 0.4$. These BHs later form binaries through dynamical encounters, producing BBH mergers that contribute up to $\sim10\%$ of all detectable events, comparable to predictions for the hierarchical channel. However, the two pathways predict distinct signatures: hierarchical mergers yield more unequal mass ratios, whereas accretion-grown BHs preferentially form near-equal-mass binaries. The accretion-driven channel allows dense clusters with low escape speeds, such as globular clusters, to produce highly spinning BBHs with both components in or above the mass gap, providing a natural formation pathway to GW231123-like systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultra-violet (UV) radiation from accreting black holes ionizes the intergalactic gas around early quasars, carving out highly ionized bubbles in their surroundings. Any changes in a quasar's luminosity are therefore predicted to produce outward-propagating ionization gradients, affecting the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) absorption opacity near the quasar's systemic redshift. This "proximity effect" is well-documented in rest-UV quasar spectra but only provides a one-dimensional probe along our line-of-sight. Here we present deep spectroscopic observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of galaxies in the background of a super-luminous quasar at $z_{\rm QSO}\approx6.3$, which reveal the quasar's "light echo" with Ly$\alpha$ tomography in the transverse direction. This transverse proximity effect is detected for the first time towards multiple galaxy sightlines, allowing us to map the extent and geometry of the quasar's ionization cone. We obtain constraints on the orientation and inclination of the cone, as well as an upper limit on the obscured solid angle fraction of $f_{\rm obsc}<91\%$. Additionally, we find a timescale of the quasar's UV radiation of $t_{\rm QSO}=10^{5.6^{+0.1}_{-0.3}}$ years, which is significantly shorter than would be required to build up the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) with conventional growth models, but is consistent with independent measurements of the quasars' duty cycle. Our inferred obscured fraction disfavors a scenario where short quasar lifetimes can be explained exclusively by geometric obscuration, and instead supports the idea that radiatively inefficient accretion or growth in initially heavily enshrouded cocoons plays a pivotal role in early SMBH growth. Our results pave the way for novel studies of quasars' ionizing geometries and radiative histories at early cosmic times.

 - **Abstract**
 New populations of red active galactic nuclei (known as ``Little Red Dots'') discovered by JWST exhibit remarkable spectral energy distributions. Leveraging X-ray through far-infrared observations of two of the most luminous known Little Red Dots, we directly their bolometric luminosities. We find evidence that more than half of the bolometric luminosity likely emerges in the rest-frame optical, with $L_{\rm bol}/L_{5100} = 5$, roughly half the value for ``standard'' Active Galactic Nuclei. Meanwhile, the X-ray emitting corona, UV-emitting black-body, and reprocessed mid to far-infrared emission are all considerably sub-dominant, assuming that the far-infrared luminosity is well below current measured limits. We present new bolometric corrections that dramatically lower inferred bolometric luminosities by a factor of ten compared to published values in the literature. These bolometric corrections are in accord with expectations from models in which gas absorption and reprocessing are responsible for the red rest-frame optical colors of Little Red Dots. We discuss how this lowered luminosity scale suggests a lower mass scale for the population by at least an order of magnitude {\bf (e.g., $\sim 10^5-10^7~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ black holes, and $\sim 10^8~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ galaxies)}, alleviating tensions with clustering, overmassive black holes, and the integrated black hole mass density in the Universe.

#### The possible accretion discs of GN-z11 at redshift z = 10.6, MoM-z14 at z = 14.44 and other high redshift objects

 - **Abstract**
 The JWST has enabled the discovery of Active Galactic Nuclei at high redshifts. The intrinsic UV spectrum of GN-z11 at redshift z = 10.6 has a spectral slope compatible with a standard accretion disc. By fitting a disc model to its spectrum, we find that the mass of the black hole must be above 1.6e7 Msun in order that it lies below the Eddington limit. We define this mass as the Eddington mass of the black hole. We note that the spectral shape is consistent with that of accreting stellar mass black holes sources in their soft state, for which no variability is expected. Mom-z14 is a more distant object at z = 14.44 and has a similar UV slope. Disc model-fitting gives a similar result but lower mass accretion rate. We also examine 3 further high redshift objects: GS z14-1, GHZ2 and GS-z11-1 at z = 13.86, 12.34 and 11.28, again obtaining similar results. If sub-Eddington accretion discs are indeed the origin of much of the UV emission from these objects, then the existence of massive black holes less than 440 and 290 Myr after the Big Bang point either to exceptional black hole seeds or to primordial black holes. The observed spread of UV spectral slopes in high redshift objects suggests that our approach may be relevant to about half of that population.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) formed from the collapse of density fluctuations provide a unique window into the physics of the early Universe. Their evaporation through Hawking radiation around the epoch of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) can leave measurable imprints on the primordial light-element abundances. In this work, we analyze in detail the effects of PBHs evaporating before BBN, with various intermediate steps understood analytically, and obtain the BBN constraint on PBHs within a transparent and reproducible framework. We find that, to produce observable effects on BBN, the PBH mass must exceed $10^{9}$ g, a threshold higher than that reported in some earlier studies. Slightly above $10^{9}$ g, the BBN sensitivity rapidly increases with the mass and then decreases, with the turning point occurring at $2\times10^{9}$ g. For PBHs in the mass range $[10^{9},\ 10^{10}]$ g, current measurements of BBN observables set an upper bound on the initial mass fraction parameter $\beta$ ranging from $10^{-17}$ to $10^{-19}$. To facilitate future improvements, we make our code publicly available, enabling straightforward incorporation of updated nuclear reaction rates, particle-physics inputs, and cosmological data.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the nature of dark matter (DM) particles remains a pivotal challenge in modern cosmology. Current cosmological research on these phenomena primarily utilizes cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and other late-time probes, which predominantly focus on large scales. We introduce a novel probe, the 21 cm forest signal, which can be used to investigate DM properties on small scales during the epoch of reionization, thereby addressing the gap left by other cosmological probes. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from PBHs, can heat the intergalactic medium (IGM). This heating suppresses the amplitude of the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. Therefore, the 1D power spectrum provides an effective method for constraining DM properties. However, astrophysical heating processes in the early universe can also affect the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. In this work, we assess the potential of using the SKA to observe the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum for constraining DM properties, under the assumption that astrophysical heating can be constrained reliably by other independent probes. Under low astrophysical heating conditions, the 1D power spectrum could constrain the DM annihilation cross section and decay lifetime to $\langle\sigma v\rangle \sim {10^{-31}}\,{\rm cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$ and $\tau \sim {10^{30}}\,{\rm s}$ for ${10}\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles, and probe PBHs with masses $\sim {10^{15}}\,{\rm\,g}$ at abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \simeq 10^{-13}$. These constraints represent improvements of 5-6 orders of magnitude over current limits. Furthermore, the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum has the potential to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe PBHs with masses above $10^{18}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes.

 - **Abstract**
 In the presence of significant measurement uncertainties, the events which appear to be the most extreme are very likely to be those exhibiting the greatest statistical fluctuations. It is therefore particularly important to exercise care when interpreting such events and to use the entire observed population for context. Here, I attempt to pedagogically illustrate this using the example of the most massive binary black hole so far detected in gravitational-wave data, GW231123. I argue that its total mass may be significantly lower than $238^{+28}_{-49}$ solar masses as reported by Abac et al. (2025a). The maximum total binary black hole mass from an analysis of the entire detected population may well be less than 140 solar masses, but the value is very sensitive to assumptions about the population distribution.

#### Solar--System Experiments in the Search for Dark Energy and Dark Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We reassess the realistic discovery reach of Solar--System experiments for dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) and quantify their complementarity to dedicated cosmological probes, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid mission. In scalar-tensor frameworks with universal conformal coupling $A(\phi)$, screening (chameleon/symmetron, Vainshtein) suppresses fifth forces in deep Solar potentials, consistent with the gravitational-wave speed bound $|c_{\tt T}/c-1|\lesssim 10^{-15}$. We treat Solar--System tests as hypothesis-driven probes: we assemble quantitative guardrails (MICROSCOPE $\eta$, Cassini $\gamma$, LLR $\dot G/G$ and SEP, ephemeris limits on $\rho_{\rm DM}$ and Yukawa $\alpha(\lambda)$, and clock-network searches for ultralight DM), place them alongside current cosmology posteriors, and provide an explicit map from cosmology-level linear response (e.g., $\mu_{\rm lin,0}$) to local residuals using the screening relations (thin--shell and Vainshtein). Guided by systematics-gated criteria, we outline a near-term program -- solar-conjunction Shapiro-delay and Doppler/range tests, sustained millimeter-class LLR, global optical-clock links, refined ephemerides, and spaceborne atom interferometry (AIS) -- with realistic sensitivities $|\gamma-1|\in (2$--$5)\times 10^{-6}$, $\eta_{\rm EEP}\sim10^{-16}$--$10^{-17}$ (AIS/LLR), $|\dot{G}/G|\lesssim (2$--$5)\times 10^{-14}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, a uniform $\simeq 2\times$ tightening of AU-scale Yukawa/DM-density bounds, and $3$--$10\times$ gains in ultralight-DM couplings from clock networks. Primary discovery potential for late-time dark energy lies with multi-probe cosmology (geometry and growth), while a hypothesis-driven Solar--System program supplies high-leverage falsification and selective discovery windows for dark matter with ultralight mediators or long-range forces.

#### Reassessing the Spin of Second-born Black Holes in Coalescing Binary Black Holes and Its Connection to the chi_eff-q Correlation

 - **Abstract**
 The mass ratio q and effective inspiral spin chi_eff of binary black hole mergers in GWTC-4.0 have been reported to display a weakeran ti-correlation compared to GWTC-3, a feature whose origin has been explored by several groups. In this work, within the isolated binary evolution framework, we adopt a recently proposed wind prescription for helium stars to systematically investigate the spin of the second-born black hole and its role in shaping this correlation. Using the stellar and binary evolution code MESA, which includes a recently proposed helium-star wind prescription alongside internal differential rotation and tidal interactions,we find that the recently proposed wind prescription for helium stars is substantially weaker than the standard Dutch wind scheme, particularly at subsolar metallicity. Using this scheme, we perform detailed binary modeling of a helium star with a black hole companion. Our results show that the spin magnitude of the resulting black hole is insensitive to the helium star's evolutionary stage at the onset of tidal interactions or to the companion mass. Instead, wind mass loss plays the dominant role: more massive helium-star progenitors produce lower-spinning black holes. The initial stellar rotation has only a minor effect, especially under strong tidal coupling, consistent with the common assumption of orbital synchronization. Using the derived relation between the mass and spin of the second-born black hole, we find that the properties of most binary black holes in GWTC-4.0-specifically the mass ratio q and effective inspiral spin chi_eff-can be reproduced. We further show that the q-chi_eff correlation is sensitive to the assumed mass function (e.g., Gaussian and uniform distribution), displaying notable deviations from the Power-Law+Peak model.

#### Evidence for Two SNe Type Triggering GRB 220101A: a Pair SN and a Rotating Magnetized Core Collapse SN

 - **Abstract**
 The traditional model which assumed GRBs as originating from a single Black Hole (BH) have been modified by the Binary Driven Hypernova (BdHN) model in which the trigger of the GRB originate from a binary system composed of a 10 solar mass CO core and a 2 solar mass neutron star binary companion. The binary period being as short as minutes to hours. Recent results evidence that the most energetic GRBs may have as precursors a sequence of two types of SN: a pair-SN followed soon after by a more traditional core collapse. All this appear to open the way to two new types of SNe: the Pair-SNe without a remnant and a magnetized-rotating-core collapse leading to the formation of a pulsar. We generalize our previous assumptions, here the possibility of fission of the rapidly rotating CO core is examined. The role of the magnetic field of the CO core are equally examined with the magneto-hydrodynamic associated process, all the way to generate overcritical fields and e+ e- pairs. All this appear to open the way to a new types of SN, much in line with pair-SN models and a significant change from the initial non rotating models. The BdHN are characterized by seven new physics Episodes here all used to formulate the new approach. The substantial modification of each Episode are outlined by a leading order treatment.

#### The Shape of AGN-Driven Winds in the Seyfert Galaxy NGC 3516

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are known to drive ionized gas into their host galaxies, which may affect the evolution of both the central supermassive black holes and their hosts. In the case of NGC 3516, a nearby Seyfert 1 galaxy, these AGN winds have historically proven difficult to disentangle from galactic rotation. Using long slit spectroscopy at multiple position angles from the Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and the Apache Point Observatory Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi Object Spectrograph, we separate these kinematic components by fitting multiple Gaussians to the H{\alpha}, N II, H{\beta}, and O III emission lines along the slits. We present a biconical outflow model that agrees well with the observed kinematics of the outflowing gas in the narrow-line region (NLR). Our results indicate that the structure of the O III emission is explained by dusty gas spirals in the galactic disk that are illuminated by the ionizing bicone, which is viewed along one edge, resulting in the complex nuclear kinematics. Our view into the bicone edge is consistent with the multiple, deep components of ionized absorption lines seen in UV and X-ray spectra of NGC 3516. The observed turnover in the velocity of the NLR clouds matches that from a simple dynamical model of radiative acceleration by the AGN and gravitational deceleration by the AGN and galaxy, indicating they are the principal forces at work on the gas clouds. Finally, the model launch radii indicate that the outflowing clouds originate primarily from the inner dusty spirals near the AGN.

#### The full jet production cycle observed during fast state transitions in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348$-$630

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole X-ray binaries (BH XRBs) launch powerful relativistic jets during bright outburst phases. The properties of these outflows change dramatically between different spectral/accretion states. Collimated, compact jets are observed during the hard state and are quenched during the soft state, while discrete ejecta are mainly launched during the hard-to-soft state transition. Currently, we still do not understand what triggers the formation and destruction of compact jets or the launch of discrete ejecta. In this context, finding a unique link between the jet evolution and the properties of the X-ray emission, such as its fast variability, would imply a major progress in our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that drive relativistic outflows in BH XRBs. Here we show that a brief but strong radio re-brightening during a predominantly soft state of the BH XRB MAXI J1348$-$630 was contemporaneous with a significant increase in the X-ray rms variability observed with NICER in 2019. During this phase, the variability displayed significant changes and, at the same time, MAXI J1348$-$630 launched two pairs of relativistic discrete ejecta that we detected with the MeerKAT and ATCA radio-interferometers. We propose that short-lived compact jets were reactivated during this excursion to the hard-intermediate state and were switched off before the ejecta launch, a phenomenology that has been very rarely observed in these systems. Interestingly, with the caveat of gaps in our radio and X-ray coverage, we suggest a tentative correspondence between the launch of ejecta and the drop in X-ray rms variability in this source, while other typical X-ray signatures associated with discrete ejections are not detected. We discuss how these results provide us with insights into the complex and dynamic coupling between the jets and hot corona in BH XRBs.

 We present our methodology for identifying known clusters as counterparts to objects in the Euclid Catalogue of Galaxy Clusters (ECGC). Euclid is expected to detect a large number of optically-selected galaxy clusters over the approximately 14000 square degrees of its extragalactic sky survey. Extending out well beyond redshift unity, the catalogue will contain many new high-redshift clusters, while at lower redshifts a fraction of the clusters will have been observed in other surveys. Identifying these known clusters as counterparts to the Euclid-detected clusters is an important step in the validation and construction of the ECGC to augment information with external observables. We present a set of catalogues and meta-catalogues of known clusters that we have assembled for this step, and we illustrate their application and our methodology using the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 RedMaPPer cluster catalogue in lieu of the future ECGC. In the process of this work, we have constructed and deliver an updated EC-RedMaPPer catalogue with multi-wavelength counterparts.

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar initial mass function (sIMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses formed in a single star formation event in a molecular cloud clump. It is fundamental to astrophysics and cosmology, shaping our understanding of unresolved stellar populations, galactic chemical enrichment and habitable zones, and black hole growth. This White Paper reviews studies on the core mass function, stellar multiplicity, and dynamical processes affecting sIMF determinations, as well as the link between star-forming clumps and the galaxy-wide IMF (gIMF). The evidence gleaned from observed systems for the dependency of the sIMF on the metallicity and density of the clump is portrayed. We examine evidence from gravitational lensing, stellar and gas kinematics, and spectral diagnostics to assess environmental dependencies of the gIMF. Theoretical perspectives provide further insights into the sIMF's variability. Beyond summarizing current knowledge, this work aims to establish a shared framework and define strategies for studying a variable IMF in the era of near-infrared integral-field spectroscopy, 30m-class telescopes and major space-based observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 High-redshift ($z>2$) blazars, with relativistic jets aligned toward us, probe the most powerful end of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) population. We aim at determining the black hole masses and mass accretion rates of high-$z$ blazars in a common framework that utilizes a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting method and the Shakura-Sunayev multi-temperature accretion disk model, accounting also for attenuation due to neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We compiled a sample of 23 high-redshift blazars from the literature with publicly available infrared-to-ultraviolet photometric data. We performed a Bayesian fit to the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the accretion disk, accounting for upper limits, and determined the black hole masses and mass accretion rates with their uncertainties. We also examined the impact of optical-ultraviolet attenuation due to gas in the IGM. We find that neglecting IGM attenuation in SED fits leads to systematically larger black-hole mass estimates and correspondingly lower Eddington ratios, with the bias becoming more severe at higher redshift. Our MCMC fits yield median black-hole masses in the range $\sim (10^{8}-10^{10})\,M_{\odot}$ and a broad distribution of median Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.04 - 1$). Comparison with previous literature shows no clear method-dependent systematic offsets, although individual mass estimates can differ by up to a factor of a few. We also demonstrate that assumptions about black-hole spin introduce a systematic degeneracy. This work is to our knowledge the first systematic study to model the accretion-disk emission of a large sample of high-$z$ blazars within a single, consistent statistical framework. Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for IGM attenuation and of using uniform fitting methods when comparing disk-based black hole estimates across samples.

 - **Abstract**
 The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) will deliver the first comprehensive view of the obscured side of star formation and black hole accretion that dominates galaxy growth at cosmic noon. Around 90% of UV/optical photons from young stars and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are absorbed by dust and reradiated in the mid- to far-infrared, where key diagnostic lines trace accretion, star formation, and the physical and chemical conditions of galaxies. PRIMA will conduct blind spectroscopic surveys out to $z \sim 3-4$, enabling an unbiased determination of the co-evolution of star formation and black hole growth with cosmic time. We simulate a 200 arcmin$^2$ blind spectroscopic survey with FIRESS to measure star formation and black hole accretion rates for hundreds of galaxies at cosmic noon. Follow-up observations will provide relative N/O abundances and N/O-independent metallicities from multiple mid-IR lines. In its high-resolution mode, FIRESS will probe feedback processes through P-Cygni profiles, blueshifted OH absorption, and emission-line wings from highly ionised gas. Beyond cosmic noon, PRIMA will pioneer rest-frame mid-IR spectroscopy of galaxies during reionisation. Bright high-ionisation lines will constrain the primary ionising continuum of luminous Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters and low-metallicity AGN, revealing the conditions that shaped the first galaxies and black holes. By bridging the gap between optical and radio facilities, PRIMA will deliver an unobscured, end-to-end view of the processes driving galaxy evolution from the earliest epochs to the peak of activity.

 - **Abstract**
 A semi-analytical model for the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm has been shown to yield stellar mass-BH mass relations that reproduce both the JWST and pre-JWST observations. Either fuzzy or warm dark matter (FDM or WDM) would suppress the formation of the smaller galactic halos that play important roles in the CDM fit to the high-redshift SMBH data. Our analysis of the stellar mass-BH mass relation disfavours FDM fields with masses $< 2.0\times 10^{-20}$ eV and WDM particles with masses $< 7.2$ keV, both at the 95 % confidence level.

 - **Abstract**
 We study how quantum features of spacetime, specifically the curvature of momentum space, can backreact on classical gravity in a semiclassical (2+1)D setting with a negative cosmological constant. Starting from a first-order action, we derive an effective configuration-space action, revealing mass-dependent geodesics and a mild violation of the equivalence principle. Coupling this modified matter source to Einstein gravity, we obtain a corrected BTZ black hole, with ADM mass, Hawking temperature, and entropy acquiring explicit corrections and upper bounds dictated by the momentum-space geometry. We also compute the return time of a massless particle along null geodesics, illustrating observable signatures of underlying quantum-spacetime structures. Our results provide a concrete semiclassical framework showing how Planck-scale kinematic modifications leave imprints on classical geometry.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we have examined spherical accretion onto Schwarzschild MOG Black Holes within the framework of Modified Gravity. Using isothermal test fluids, we analyze the behavior of the flow near the critical (sonic) point for various values of the equation of state parameter $k$. Depending on the fluid type, the flow exhibits either subsonic or supersonic behavior, with ultra-stiff and ultra-relativistic fluids allowing both regimes, while radiation and sub-relativistic fluids show more restricted dynamics. Phase space analysis helps visualize these transitions. We also compute the mass accretion rate and find that it increases with both radial distance and the MOG parameter $\alpha$, highlighting the role of modified gravity in enhancing accretion processes around black holes

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we prove a series of results concerning the uniqueness of Kerr-de Sitter as a family of smooth stationary black hole solutions to the nonlinear Einstein vacuum equations with positive cosmological constant $\Lambda$. The results only assume smoothness rather than analyticity of the solution in question. The results use a two-sided approach to rigidity, requiring assumptions on both the event horizon and the cosmological horizon (or a neighborhood thereof) to formulate an appropriate unique continuation argument to prove the rigidity of Kerr-de Sitter.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we have considered the Kerr-like black hole (BH) model in Horndeski gravity and analyse the visual characteristics of shadow images under two illumination models, such as a celestial light source and a thin accretion disk. To capture the BH shadow images, we utilise a recent fisheye camera model and ray-tracing procedures. In this view, we carefully addressed the influence of the spin parameter $a$ and the hair parameter $h$ on the BH shadow images. The results indicate that for smaller values of $h$, the BH shadow contours shift noticeably towards the right side of the screen, while for larger values of $h$, the nearly circular shadow gradually deforms into a ``D'' shape profile. For a celestial light source, the larger values of $h$ lead to a reduction in the corresponding radius of the photon ring, while the space-dragging effect becomes more pronounced with increasing $a$. We further discuss the distinctive characteristics of images observed in both prograde and retrograde accretion disk scenarios. The results reveal that variations in $h$ significantly affect both the inner shadow and the resulting Einstein ring. Subsequently, we also discussed the distinct features of red-shift configurations on the disk for both direct and lensed images, which are closely related to the accretion flow and the relevant parameters. We also attempt to use the recent observational data from M$87^{\ast}$ and Sgr $A^{\ast}$ and constrain the hair parameter $h$, confirming the validity of Horndeski gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 A compact object illuminated by background radiation produces a dark silhouette. The edge of the silhouette or shadow (alternatively, the apparent boundary or the critical curve) is commonly determined by the presence of the photon sphere (or photon shell in the case of rotating spacetime), corresponding to the maximum of the effective potential for null geodesics. While this statement stands true for Kerr black holes, here we remark that the apparent boundary (as defined by Bardeen) forms under a more general condition. We demonstrate that a shadow forms if the effective potential of null geodesics has a positive finite upper bound and includes a region where photons are trapped or scattered. Our framework extends beyond conventional solutions, including but not limited to naked singularities. Furthermore, we clarify the difference between the apparent boundary of a dark shadow and the bright ring on the screen of a distant observer. These results provide a unified theoretical basis for interpreting observations from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and guiding future efforts towards extreme-resolution observations of compact objects.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how resonant excitation near exceptional points manifests in Kerr black hole ringdown waveforms and examine its extraction. Using waveforms generated by localized initial data, where quasinormal mode amplitudes are given solely by excitation factors, we establish a controlled benchmark for overtone extraction. Applying an iterative fitting method with mirror modes, we analyze a mild resonance in the $(l,m)=(2,2)$ multipole and a sharp resonance in the $(3,1)$ multipole occurring as part of a sequence of successive resonances. For $(2,2)$, we extract the fundamental mode, the first three overtones, and the fundamental mirror mode with relative errors below $10\%$, and show that residual waveforms exhibit the expected damped sinusoids together with distinctive resonance signatures. For $(3,1)$, we demonstrate that resonances can not only amplify but also reduce QNM excitations, reshaping the overtone hierarchy and rendering the sharp resonance more pronounced in ringdown. Our results clarify the imprint of resonance in Kerr ringdown and highlight both the robustness and limitations of current extraction techniques, providing a foundation for more reliable extraction of higher overtones and for applications to observational data analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 The effective one-body (EOB) theory provides an innovative framework for analyzing the dynamics of binary systems, as articulated by Hamilton's equations. This paper investigates a self-consistent EOB theory specifically tailored for the dynamics of such systems. Our methodology begins by emphasizing how to effectively utilize the metrics derived from scattering angles in the analysis of binary black hole mergers. We then construct an effective Hamiltonian and formulate a decoupled, variable-separated Teukolsky-like equation for $\psi^B_4$. Furthermore, we present the formal solution to this equation, detailing the energy flux, radiation-reaction force (RRF), and waveforms for the ``plus" and ``cross" modes generated by spinless binaries. Finally, we carry out numerical calculations using the EOB theory and compare the results with numerical relativity (NR) data from the SXS collaboration. The results indicate that to the innermost stable circular orbit, the binding energy -- angular momentum relation differs from the NR results by less than $5$\textperthousand, with a larger mass ratio yielding better agreement.

 In this paper, an in-depth investigation of the thermodynamic relations for AdS Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) is presented. This investigation is conducted within both the restricted phase space (RPS) and the conformal field theory (CFT) frameworks. The influence of non-extensive forms of entropy is also systematically examined. Our results demonstrate that the Goon-Penco (GP) relation for charged AdS black holes holds within both the RPS and CFT frameworks, irrespective of the specific form of entropy modification. The conclusion of the present study demonstrates that the GP relation constitutes a universal thermodynamic relation.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we develop a generalized perturbative framework for gravitational shadows in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. Building upon the recent two-parameter perturbative framework of Kobialko et al. \cite{Kobialko:2024zhc}, this work extends the expansion in particle energy and metric deviation to encompass arbitrary, simultaneous deformations of all metric functions. By relaxing the common restriction of a fixed area radius ($\beta(r) = r^2$), our formalism applies to a significantly broader class of alternative gravity theories and exotic compact objects. We derive analytical formulae for the massive shadow radius up to the second order in the deformation parameter, explicitly revealing the phenomenological signatures that arise from the coupling between temporal and spatial metric perturbations. The key result is that the distinct energy dependence of the massive shadow provides a powerful method to disentangle these different types of geometric deformations, breaking observational degeneracies inherent in the photon shadow alone. We demonstrate this principle with applications to traversable wormholes and canonical scalar-tensor solutions, showing how each produces a unique, distinguishable energy-dependent fingerprint. This generalized framework provides a robust, theory-agnostic tool for testing strong-field gravity. It offers a clear methodology for reconstructing metric parameters from potential multi-messenger observations of massive particle shadows.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the thermodynamic and entanglement properties of dynamical black holes based on the recently proposed dynamical black hole entropy by Hollands-Wald-Zhang. We first provide a direct proof that, under first order perturbations, the dynamical black hole entropy in any $f(R)$ theory equals the Wald entropy evaluated on the generalized apparent horizon. Then, we compute the gravitational entanglement entropy explicitly using both the event horizon and the apparent horizon as the entangling surfaces, and show that only the apparent horizon prescription reproduces the correct dynamical black hole entropy satisfying the physical process first law. Furthermore, we reinterpret the generalized second law by identifying the modified von Neumann entropy as the matter entanglement across the (generalized) apparent horizon. This allows us to express the total entropy as the renormalized generalized entropy evaluated on this surface for both Einstein's gravity and $f(R)$ gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational helicity flux density represents the angular distribution of helicity flux in general relativity. In this work, we explore its relationship to the reduction of topological invariants at future null infinity. Contrary to initial expectations, the Pontryagin term, which contributes to the gravitational chiral anomaly, is not related to the gravitational helicity flux density. Instead, the Nieh-Yan term, another topological invariant within the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR), can reproduce this flux density. We also reduce these two topological invariants to null hypersurfaces describing near-horizon geometry. In this near-horizon context, the Pontryagin term yields a non-trivial quantity that may characterize a Carrollian fluid helicity relevant to near-horizon physics.

 We investigate the mixed state entanglement structure through the reflected entropy for disjoint radiation subsystems coupled to a 2d eternal brane world black hole in a time dependent defect AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$ scenario. Utilizing the island prescription and the defect extremal surface (DES) formula, we demonstrate a complex mixed state entanglement structure through the reflected entropy corresponding to distinct entanglement entropy phases. In each case we verify the holographic duality of the reflected entropy with the bulk entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS) and also obtain the Page curves for both the entanglement entropy and the associated reflected entropy phases. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to adjacent radiation subsystems and obtain consistent results using both the island and the DES prescription.

 - **Abstract**
 The matrix models are non-perturbative formulations of string theory, from which many believe that spacetime arises. The matrix fluctuations around the spacetime thus created should represent both matter and gravitational fields. In this paper, we discuss how the gravitational field emerges from the IIB matrix model. In particular, we consider how diffeomorphism invariance arises and how unitarity is guaranteed in this theory. Specifically, we consider matrices as bilocal fields and discuss how the Lorentz-invariant vacuum and low-energy excitations around it can be expressed. We then discuss how the conditions for the theory to be unitary can be written in terms of bilocal fields. We show that in the low-energy limit, the bilocal fields are reduced to local fields consisting of a finite number of massless fields and an infinite number of massive fields, satisfying unitarity.

 - **Abstract**
 The Higgs field is conventionally treated as a small local perturbation atop a large, constant vacuum value that uniformly permeates the universe. I propose instead that in regions of extreme gravitational intensity -- such as near gravitational singularities -- the Higgs field behaves in a profoundly non-perturbative manner. In such environments, spacetime and the Higgs field engage in a dynamic interplay that extends spacetime beyond the singularity, achieving geodesic completeness. The continuation beyond the singularity is dominated by antigravity effects, reshaping the causal structure of spacetime and enabling novel flows of matter and information, including traversal through singularities. In its standard form, the combined framework of the Standard Model (SM) and General Relativity (GR), as well as most of its extensions, fails to capture these phenomena due to its geodesic incompleteness. By contrast, a refined, locally conformal-symmetric formulation -- denoted i(SM+GR) -- naturally incorporates these effects. GR is not an optional component of i(SM+GR) but an essential ingredient. This framework preserves the empirical success of SM+GR in the low-energy regime while predicting striking new phenomena in extreme gravitational settings, including within black holes (on both sides of the singularity) and in pre--Big Bang cosmology. At the classical field theory level, i(SM+GR) offers fresh perspectives on the black hole information puzzle and provides a platform for locally scale-invariant generalizations, such as geodesically complete quantum field theory, string theory, and unified models of fundamental interactions. This paper presents the detailed derivations and explanations that underlie a condensed letter version recently published in [1].
