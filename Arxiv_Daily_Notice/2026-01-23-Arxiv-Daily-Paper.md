#### Optimizing Optical Searches for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in AGN Light Curves: Fourier versus Bayesian Periodicity Detection

 - **Abstract**
 Simulations predict that supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) will exhibit periodic brightness variations that may exceed the stochastic variability intrinsic to active galactic nuclei (AGN). In this paper, we simulate SMBHBs with damped random walk (DRW) AGN variability and an added sinusoidal signal from the orbital motion, and test three methods -- the Generalized Lomb Scargle Periodogram (GLSP), the nested Bayesian sampler (NBS), and the Weighted Wavelet Z-Transform (WWZ) -- to determine which is best at recovering the periodicity. Our simulated light curves follow the properties of the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS), Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) to best inform current and future SMBHB searches. We map a broad range of parameter space and identify which DRW-only light curves best mimic periodicity and pass each method's model selection. The NBS performs best at detecting periodicity and filtering out DRW-only light curves. Combined candidate selection with both the NBS and GLSP significantly reduces false positive rates with marginal impact to true positive rates. With this joint model selection pipeline, we find the lowest false positive rates in ZTF-like simulations and the highest detection rates in LSST-like simulations. Using a modified computation of the False Alarm Probability (FAP) with GLSP, we efficiently triage LSST AGN light curves (~10^7 light curves in ~10-30 hours) and achieve true- and false- positive rates of ~40% and ~0.5%, respectively.

 - **Abstract**
 Compact galaxy groups are ideal laboratories for studying the effects of interactions between AGN and multiple nearby galaxies. Recent JWST observations of the nearby compact group Stephan's Quintet highlight tidal flows between the interacting galaxies as well as outflows from the active galaxy NGC 7319. To study the kinematics on a large scale throughout the group, we obtained spatially-resolved long-slit spectra of Stephan's Quintet at multiple slit positions with Apache Point Observatory's Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph. We fit multiple Gaussians to the H$\alpha$ $\lambda$6563 Å and [N II] $\lambda\lambda$6548, 6583 Å emission lines to isolate the different kinematic components. We used the kinematics to develop the first biconical outflow model of the narrow-line region of NGC 7319. Using a combination of galactic rotation models, biconical outflow models, and kinematic maps of the ionized gas, we disentangled the outflows, rotation, and tidal flows in the group. We found outflow radial velocities up to 550 km s$^{-1}$ peaking at 2.6 kpc from the central supermassive black hole, and a transition from AGN-powered outflows to gravitationally-powered tidal flows at a projected distance between 2.4 -- 6.3 kpc. We performed a line ratio analysis and determined the gas shows Seyfert-like ionization out to 6.3 kpc (projected), which supports our finding that gas outside this radius is predominantly powered by tidal flows. Our separation of kinematic components in Stephan's Quintet will enable future studies of the physical conditions and dynamical forces in the ionized gas to better quantify the feeding and feedback processes of AGN in compact groups.

#### Constraining nonminimal f(T) gravity from Primordial Nucleosynthesis to Late-Universe observations

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-epoch test of f(T) gravity with nonminimal torsion-matter coupling, combining early- and late-Universe observations. At the MeV scale, Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis constrains the fractional variation of the weak freeze-out temperature, |{\delta}{\tau}_f/{\tau}_f|, thereby mapping light-element abundances into limits on deviations from the standard expansion history. At low redshift, we confront the model with type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic-chronometer data, which respectively probe distances, the late-time standard ruler, and the Hubble rate. Independent analyses highlight the complementary roles of each dataset, while a joint SNe Ia + BAO + CC fit breaks degeneracies and yields the tightest combined bounds. As an illustration, we examine two representative torsion-modified gravity scenarios: BBN strongly limits large departures from standard cosmology, whereas late-time probes remain compatible with a near-{\Lambda}CDM background. This unified approach demonstrates the power of linking early-Universe nuclear physics with precision cosmological observables in assessing torsional extensions of gravity.

#### Fuzzy dark matter soliton core hosting a supermassive black hole as a dense low-mass perturber in strong gravitational lensing

 - **Abstract**
 Recent high-resolution imaging observations of strong lens systems reveal dense low-mass perturbers. We propose a soliton core, whose central density is boosted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH), in the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) model as an efficient perturber in strong gravitational lensing. The higher central density makes it less efficient in the tidal mass loss, and leads to the higher impact in gravitational lensing. We show that the mass profile of a $\sim 10^6M_\odot$ perturber in JVAS B1938+666, which does not resemble any known astronomical object, can be wel explained by a soliton core in the FDM model with the mass of $4\times 10^{-21}$eV hosting an SMBH with the mass of $4\times 10^5M_\odot$. The high mass of the SMBH may be explained by several scenarios that predcit heavy SMBH seeds such as the direct collapse black hole formation and primordial black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 In the local Universe, supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses strongly correlate with their host-galaxies' stellar masses ($M_{*}$), but galaxies hosting faint AGN recently found by JWST may deviate from this relation. To constrain the M$_{\text{BH}}$-M$_{*}$ relation at high redshift, we performed AGN-host image decomposition for 17 low-luminosity AGN galaxies at $z$\,$\sim$\,4--6 using NIRCam images in the JADES GOODS-N field. These sources are identified as AGNs from broad H$\alpha$ emission lines detected by the CONGRESS and FRESCO surveys. We used \textsc{galfit+MCMC} to fit spatial profiles in 7 wide-band images and detected extended emission in 9 sources out of 17. The close spatial alignment between the extended components and the AGN centers indicates that this emission likely originates from the host galaxies. These sources are extended at 0.9--2.0~$\mu$m, suggesting significant host-galaxy light in the rest-frame UV. For the sources with the host detection, the stellar mass inferred based on image decomposition result can be 1-2 dex lower than the results without image decomposition. The BH-to-stellar mass ratio spans $M_{\text{BH}}/M_\ast$\,$\sim$\,0.01--1.48, placing them well above the local $M_{\text{BH}}$--$M_\ast$ relation. In contrast, the host-galaxy size--mass relation broadly agrees with previous measurements. Our results suggest that the host galaxies of these faint AGN are either genuinely under-massive compared to their black hole masses, or too compact to be spatially resolved.

#### Constraining Nuclear Molecular Gas Content with High-resolution CO Imaging of GOALS Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present measurements of the cool molecular gas mass around the nuclei of two gas-rich mergers, III Zw 035 and IRAS F01364-1042, whose enclosed masses (M$_\mathrm{enc}$) within the central 40-80 pc would be overmassive if attributed entirely to the supermassive black hole mass (SMBH) and compared to SMBH-galaxy scaling relations. Our gas mass measurements are derived from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 long-baseline observations of CO(J=2-1) and 230 GHz continuum emission at 14-20 pc resolution, which probes below the resolving limit of the previous black hole mass measurements. Subtracting molecular gas mass from these enclosed masses is not enough to reconcile with BH-galaxy relationships, but independently measuring M$_\mathrm{enc}$ using the cold CO(2-1) gas does shift the black holes down to their expected values. Still, these ALMA data reveal respective molecular gas masses of $\sim$3$\times$10$^7$ to $\sim$6$\times$10$^8$ M$_\odot$ within 70 pc of these black holes, which could challenge some black hole accretion models that assume nuclear gas like this has no angular momentum.

#### Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 4. Percent-Level Cosmological Constraints from Combined Probes and Robust Evidence for the Normal Neutrino Mass Hierarchy

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16165

 - **Abstract**
 We present cosmological parameters measurements from the full combination of DESI DR1 galaxy clustering data described with large-scale structure effective field theory. By incorporating additional datasets (photometric galaxies and CMB lensing cross-correlations) and extending the bispectrum likelihood to smaller scales using a consistent one-loop theory computation, we achieve substantial gains in constraining power relative to previous analyses. Combining with the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data and using cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors on the power spectrum tilt and baryon density, we obtain tight constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model, finding the Hubble constant $H_0=69.08\pm 0.37~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, the matter density fraction $\Omega_m=0.2973\pm 0.0050$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8 = 0.815\pm 0.016$ (or the lensing parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}=0.811\pm 0.016$), corresponding to $0.6\%$, $1.7\%$, and $2\%$ precision respectively. Adding the Pantheon+ supernova sample (SNe), we find a preference of $2.6\sigma$ for the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model from low-redshift data alone, which increases to $2.8\sigma$ when exchanging the SNe with Planck CMB data. Combining full-shape data with BAO, CMB, and SNe likelihoods, we improve the dark energy figure-of-merit by $18\%$ and bound the sum of the neutrino masses to $M_\nu<0.057$ eV in $\Lambda$CDM and $M_\nu<0.095$ eV in the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model (both at 95\% CL). This represents an improvement of $25\%$ over the background expansion constraints and the strongest bound on neutrino masses in $w_0w_a$CDM to date. Our results suggest that the preference for the normal ordering of neutrino mass states holds regardless of the cosmological background model, and is robust in light of tensions between cosmological datasets.

 - **Abstract**
 FarView is a proposed low frequency radio interferometer for deployment on the lunar far side, enabled by the Moon's radio quiet environment. Operating over 1-50 MHz inaccessible from Earth, FarView will open a new observational window and promote discovery class science in cosmology, heliophysics, Galactic and exoplanet astrophysics. The primary science is measurement of the redshifted 21 cm signal from the Cosmic Dark Ages (z=30-100), identified by the Astro2020 Decadal Survey as a priority cosmology discovery area. FarView will deliver 3D tomographic measurements and precision power spectra of neutral hydrogen in a largely linear regime, enabling tests of inflationary initial conditions, primordial non Gaussianity, dark matter properties, neutrino masses, and early dark energy. The reference design consists of 100000 crossed dipole antennas in a dense core-halo configuration spanning 200 sq km. A compact 4 km core with 83000 dipoles maximizes sensitivity to large scale cosmological modes, while 20000 halo elements extending to 14 km provide angular resolution and calibration for foreground characterization. Sensitivity forecasts indicate a 10-sigma detection of the Dark Ages 21 cm power spectrum at z=30 over five years of half duty cycle lunar night observations. An FFT-based EPIC beamformer is identified as an efficient signal processing architecture. Beyond cosmology, FarView will enable interferometric imaging of low frequency solar radio bursts, advancing space weather studies. Additional capabilities include stellar space weather observations, Galactic cosmic ray tomography via free-free absorption, and searches for auroral radio emission from exoplanet magnetospheres, a probe of exoplanet habitability. FarView represents a flagship class opportunity to establish the Moon as a platform for foundational astrophysics while delivering unique observational capabilities.

#### On the Missing Red Giants near the Galactic Center

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16191

 - **Abstract**
 There is a long-acknowledged deficiency of bright red giants relative to fainter old stars within a few arc seconds of Sgr A*. We explore whether this could be due to tidal stripping by the central black hole. This requires putting the stars onto highly eccentric orbits, for which we evaluate diffusion by both scalar resonant and non-resonant relaxation of the orbital angular momentum. We conclude that tidal stripping does not discriminate sufficiently between main-sequence and red giant stars. While the tidal loss cone increases with stellar radius, the rate of diffusion into the loss cone increases only logarithmically, whereas the lifetime on the red giant branch decreases more rapidly than $R_*^{-1}$. In agreement with previous studies, we find that stellar collisions are a more likely explanation for the deficiency of bright red giants relative to fainter ones.

 - **Abstract**
 Analyses of type Ia supernovae have helped us shed light on the existence and nature of dark energy. Most of these analyses have relied on Bayesian techniques. In this work, we rely on resampling techniques to analyse supernova data. In particular, we use the generalised least squares method together with Jackknife and Bootstrap techniques to estimate parameters of $\Lambda$CDM, flat $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, flat $w$CDM, and flat $w_0\,w_a$CDM models from the recent PantheonPlus and SH0ES data. For completeness, we also perform Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and nested sampling algorithms, and compare the results. We note that resampling techniques can help highlight the limitations of the data. For instance, we see that the Jackknife method estimates a strong positive correlation between $h$ and $M$ and higher standard deviations for both. This may have significant implications for the Hubble tension. We conclude with a discussion of our results.

#### Compact Stars Sourced by Dark Matter Halos and Their Frozen States

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.15415

 - **Abstract**
 Inspired by regular black holes (RBHs) sourced by dark matter halos, we generalize the anisotropic energy-momentum tensor by relaxing the $P_r = -\rho$ condition between radial pressure and density. We demonstrate that while RBHs are a unique special case, a broader class of relations yields horizonless compact stars. Under specific parameter limits, these objects approach a ``frozen state," mimicking black hole features without an event horizon. These compact star solutions could satisfy weak energy conditions and provide a robust mechanism for dark matter-sourced black hole mimickers.

#### Gravitational equal-area law and critical phenomena of cuspy black hole shadow

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.15612

 - **Abstract**
 The formation of a cusp on a black hole shadow is a striking signature of physics beyond the Kerr paradigm. We demonstrate that this morphological change fundamentally alters the shadow's topology with the topological charge flipping from 1 to -1. To analyze this topological transition, we introduce a gravitational equal-area law, analogous to Maxwell's construction in thermodynamics, and identify a critical point for cusp formation. Near this point, we uncover universal behavior characterized by a critical exponent 1/2, which places this gravitational lensing system within the mean-field universality class. These results establish a new framework for testing fundamental physics of black hole shadows, reframing the search for deviations from general relativity as a targeted hunt for a distinct topological and critical phenomenon.

#### Black hole based general relativistic limit of f(R) theory of gravity

 - **Abstract**
 The Galactic Center black hole environment gives us new opportunity to test deviation from General Relativity and black hole physics. In this work we analytically generate the shape of the Galactic Center black hole by using a recently developed exact stationary, axisymmetric and vacuum solution of $f(R)$ gravity theory. By using scalaron mass as a free parameter we find that the shadow shape along with displacement and asymmetry is sensitive to the scalaron mass, even after keeping the black hole spin low. We recognize scalaron mass which is compatible with Kerr like quadrupole moment and hence black hole "no-hair" theorem. The same mass scale is found to reproduce the PPN parameter ($\gamma$) constrained in the weak field limit of the solar system. Gravitational identifiers, the Kretschmann scalar ($\kappa$) and gravitational potential ($\phi$) have been used to infer scalaron masses in the regime of S-stars which are found to be consistent with the limits obtained using shadow scales. We ensure that $f(R)$ gravity scalaron has an appropriate general relativistic limit in the horizon scale of the black hole. We also identify the possibility of scale invariance of the General Relativistic limit.

#### Weyl-transverse gravity with boundaries

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15976

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.15976

 - **Abstract**
 We develop the covariant phase space formulation of Weyl-transverse gravity (WTG) in the presence of general timelike and spacelike boundaries. WTG is classically equivalent to General Relativity (GR) but possesses a reduced gauge symmetry consisting of Weyl transformations and transverse diffeomorphisms, together with a fixed background volume form. This structure modifies the variational principle and the definition of conserved quantities relative to GR. We derive the symplectic potential, presymplectic current, and Hamiltonian generators associated with transverse diffeomorphisms, and we identify a set of boundary conditions under which the WTG action is differentiable. These include Dirichlet and Neumann conditions for both the auxiliary Weyl-invariant metric and the dynamical metric, as well as a natural implementation of York boundary conditions, for which WTG exhibits a particularly transparent geometric formulation. We obtain the Noether current and surface charge, clarify the role of the Lagrangian ambiguity related to the cosmological constant, and evaluate the Hamiltonian identity on spacetimes containing a bifurcate Killing horizon. The resulting first-law relation shows that variations of the cosmological constant can contribute nontrivially unless additional physical restrictions are imposed.

#### Nonlinear tails of massive scalar fields around a black hole

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16016

 - **Abstract**
 Nonlinear effects play a fundamental role in the late-time ringdown of black holes, with direct implications for gravitational-wave observations. For massive fields, these dynamics become richer, yet their nonlinear signatures remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically study nonlinear tails of massive scalar perturbations, from a toy model with ingoing and outgoing sources to a self-interacting scalar model, revealing nonlinear tails and contrasting the results with their linear counterparts. We find that the nonlinear tails of massive scalar fields, opposite to massless ones, decay as the same rate as linear tails in the intermediate time, independent of source parameters or initial conditions. Nevertheless, quadratic quasinormal modes could serve as a probe to the nonlinear effects of massive fields.

#### Exact Kerr-Newman-(A)dS and other spacetimes in bumblebee gravity: employing a novel generating technique

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16037

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16037

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we show that if the bumblebee field in the Einstein-bumblebee theory is given by its vacuum expectation value ($B_{\mu}=b_{\mu}$) and it is not dynamical ($\partial_{\mu}B_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}B_{\mu}=0$), then these conditions uniquely provide a generating technique, allowing us to construct exact solutions to bumblebee gravity from the vacuum solutions by adding a term $\sim b_{\mu}b_{\nu}$ to the metric tensor. Also, we show that the bumblebee field within this technique is proportional to the tangential vector of the (timelike or spacelike) geodesic curve in the background vacuum spacetime, and can be easily found knowing the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Moreover, we prove that this technique can be extended to the case of any non-zero cosmological constant and the presence of the electromagnetic field. We apply this generating technique and obtain the bumblebee extension of the Kerr-Newman-Taub-NUT-(anti-)de Sitter spacetime. We show that this extension is not unique, as it depends on the exact geodesic curve one chooses to associate a bumblebee field with. Then, by considering various special cases of this generic solution, we demonstrate that the condition of the global reality of the bumblebee field limits the set of geodesics with which we can associate it.

#### Roche limit and stellar disruption in the Simpson--Visser spacetime

 - **Abstract**
 Due to the tidal forces that a black hole can produce, certain types of compact objects may undergo disruption as they approach the black hole. This disruption point is known as the Roche limit (or Roche radius). In this work, we studied the tidal forces arising from the presence of the Simpson--Visser black bounce. We analyzed the tidal forces both for a static observer and for a radially infalling observer and showed that differences arise depending on the choice of observer. We used the tidal forces together with the stellar binding forces to determine the Roche radius for neutron stars, white dwarfs, and Sun-like stars, and to investigate how the Simpson--Visser regularization affects the tidal disruption of these astrophysical objects. We also examined whether, for astrophysical black holes such as M87* and Sgr~A*, these stellar disruption processes occur inside or outside the event horizon, and thus whether they are observable.

#### Matrix Bootstrap Approximation without Positivity Constraint

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16099

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.16099

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a bootstrap approximation method for the Hermitian one-matrix model that does not rely on positivity constraints. The theoretical foundation of this method is that the one-matrix model admits an eigenvalue distribution $\rho(\lambda)$, and that the moments $w_n$ generated from it satisfy the loop equations. Our framework is designed to numerically determine a self-consistent pair of $\rho(\lambda)$ and $w_n$ that simultaneously satisfies these two requirements. In the concrete implementation, we employ a least-squares method, for which no sign problem arises in principle, and therefore the method can be formally applied also to Minkowski-type models. Actual numerical calculations show that this bootstrap approximation reproduces, with very high accuracy, the exact solutions for Euclidean-type models and the perturbative results for Minkowski-type models.
