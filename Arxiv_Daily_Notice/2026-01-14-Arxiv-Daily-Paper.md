#### Intermediate-mass black hole incubators. Gas accretion onto stellar black hole clusters in galactic central molecular zones

 - **Abstract**
 The stellar dynamical evolution of massive star clusters formed during starburst periods leads to the segregation of $\gtrsim10^4 M_\odot$ stellar-mass black hole sub-clusters in their centres. In gas-rich environments, such as galactic central molecular zones, these black hole clusters are likely to accrete large amounts of the gas from their surroundings, which in turn affects their internal dynamics. In this Letter we estimated the corresponding accretion rate onto the black hole cluster and its radiative feedback. We assessed whether such an accretion flow can lead to the collapse of the black hole cluster into an intermediate-mass black hole. The estimates were obtained analytically, considering the astrophysical conditions and star formation history reported for the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. We find that a stellar black hole cluster with mass $\gtrsim10^4 M_\odot$ located in the twisted ring of molecular clouds with radius $\approx100$ pc that is observed in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy can accrete about the same mass in gas on a timescale of a few million years. We suggest that this is sufficient for its subsequent collapse into an intermediate-mass black hole. Based on an estimate of the dynamical friction inspiral time, we further argue that the locations of the intermediate-mass black hole candidates recently observed in the central molecular zone are compatible with their formation therein during the last starburst period reported to have occurred $\approx1$ Gyr ago.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the formation of intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), potential seeds for supermassive black holes (SMBHs), via runaway stellar collisions for a wide range of star cluster (surface) densities ($4\times10^3 M_\odot$ pc$^{-2} \lesssim \Sigma_\mathrm{h}$ $\lesssim 4\times10^6 M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$) and metallicities ($0.01 Z_\odot \lesssim Z \lesssim 1.0 Z_\odot)$. Our sample of isolated $(>1400)$ and hierarchical ($30$) simulations of young, massive star clusters with up to $N=1.8\times10^6$ stars includes collisional stellar dynamics, stellar evolution, and post-Newtonian equations of motion for black holes using the BIFROST code. High stellar wind rates suppress IMBH formation at high metallicities $(Z \gtrsim 0.2 Z_\odot)$ and low collision rates prevent their formation at low densities ($\Sigma_\mathrm{h} \lesssim 3\times10^4 M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$). The assumptions about stellar wind loss rates strongly affect the maximum final IMBH masses $(M_\bullet \sim 6000 M_\odot$ vs. $25000 M_\odot$). The total stellar mass loss from collisions and collisionally boosted winds before $t=3$ Myr can together reach up to 5-10% of the final cluster mass. We present fitting formulae for IMBH masses as a function of host star cluster $\Sigma_\mathrm{h}$ and Z, and formulate a model for the cosmic IMBH formation rate density. Depending on the cluster birth densities, the IMBH formation rates peak at $z\sim2$-$4$ at up to $\sim10^{-7}$ yr$^{-1}$cMpc$^{-3}$. As more than 50% form below $z\lesssim1.5$-$3$, the model challenges a view in which all local IMBHs are failed early Universe SMBH seeds.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of galaxies continue to reveal new ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), increasing their known population and improving the statistics needed to understand their nature. We study the ULX populations of NGC 4631 and NGC 1097 using archival Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift/XRT observations to identify new ULXs and investigate their X-ray and optical properties. We analyzed X-ray data spanning 2000-2025. Spectral fitting was performed for sources with sufficient counts using absorbed power-law and diskbb models. Variability analyses, including hardness-intensity diagrams and light curves, were used to assess short- and long-term variability. Optical color-magnitude diagrams and near-infrared (NIR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were employed to identify possible donor stars. In NGC 4631, we identified two new transient ULXs, X-6 and X-7, with X-ray count rates varying by more than an order of magnitude. The LX-T^4 relation from diskbb fits provides strong evidence that NGC 4631 X-6 is powered by a stellar-mass black hole accreting via a standard disk. The optical sources within the X-ray error circles of X-6 and X-7 are candidate counterparts, suggesting these systems are candidate HMXBs. In NGC 1097, we discovered a new transient ULX, ULX-3, showing X-ray luminosity variations by a factor of about 30 and evidence for spectral state transitions, consistent with either a stellar-mass black hole or a neutron star. We identified a unique optical and NIR counterpart. While the optical emission is variable, the NIR emission is stable. The NIR SED is consistent with a blackbody temperature of about 3300 K, compatible with a red supergiant donor with a radius of about 200 solar radii.

 - **Abstract**
 With upcoming facilities capable of detecting photometric and gravitational wave signals from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, studying their long-term accretion-driven variability is timely. OJ287 is a bright, nearby ($z=0.3$), and well-studied candidate for a SMBH binary. As such, it is an excellent case study for how binary dynamics could influence observed active galactic nucleus (AGN) photometric variability. We present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of OJ287, using the code PHANTOM. We simulate two mass ratios: (i) M$_1$ $=$ 1.835$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ with M$_2$ $=$ 1.4$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_\odot$, (ii) M$_1\approx$ M$_2$ ($\sim10^{8}$ M$_\odot$) along and (iii) control of a single SMBH and accretion disc. We find that the simulation with masses 1.835$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and 1.4$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_\odot$ evolves consistently with the most currently accepted model of OJ287 as a precessing SMBH binary. The secondary's impacts with the disc result in the formation of spiral density waves and a corresponding $\sim$10-20% increases in the mass accretion rate of the primary SMBH. The impact timings and the mass accretion rate spikes show quasi-periodic variability as a result of the precession of the secondary's orbit with intervals between impacts ranging from $\sim$ 1 year to $\sim$ 10 years. In the near-equal mass case, the disc of the primary becomes tidally disrupted after $\sim$ 2 years. Consequently, the near-equal mass system with a period of 12 years is not a viable candidate for OJ287. This modeling provides insights into the potential signatures of SMBH binaries by both gravitational wave observatories and the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

 - **Abstract**
 Star clusters are well known for their dynamical interactions, an outcome of their high stellar densities; in this paper we use multiwavelength observations to search for the unique outcomes of these interactions in three nearby Galactic open clusters: IC 2602 (30 Myr), NGC 2632 (750 Myr) and M67 (4 Gyr). We compared X-ray observations from all-sky surveys like eROSITA, plus archival observations from Chandra X-ray Observatory, survey radio observations from ASKAP's Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey plus archival VLA observations, in conjunction with new cluster catalogs with Gaia. From X-ray, we found 77 X-ray sources likely associated with IC 2602, 31 X-ray sources in NGC 2632, and 31 near M67's central regions. We were further able to classify these X-ray sources based on their optical variability and any radio emission. Three IC 2602 X-ray sources had radio counterparts, which are likely all chromospherically active binary stars. We also identified luminous radio and X-ray variability from a spectroscopic triple system in M67, WOCS 3012/S1077, which is either consistent with a quiescent black hole binary, or due to an active binary stellar system. A recent population study of optical variables by Anderson & Hunt 2025 shows that the population of optical variables in open clusters clearly changes over cluster age; this pilot study gives evidence that the X-ray population also changes with time, and demonstrates the need for a broader multiwavelength study of Galactic open clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a measurement of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the cross-correlation of triply ionized carbon C IV absorption with the positions of quasars (QSO) and Emission Line Galaxies (ELG). We use quasars and ELGs from the second data release (DR2) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. Our data sample consists of 2.5 million quasars, 3.1 million ELGs, and the C IV absorption is measured along the line of sight of 1.5 million high redshift quasars with $z > 1.3$. We measure the isotropic BAO signal at 4.2$\sigma$ for the CIV$\times$QSO cross-correlation. This translates into a 3.0% precision measurement of the ratio of the isotropic distance scale, $D_{\rm V}$, and the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_{\rm d}$, with $D_{\rm V}/r_{\rm d}(z_{\rm eff} = 1.92) = 30.3 \pm 0.9$. We make the first detection of the BAO feature in the CIV$\times$ELG cross-correlation at a significance of 2.5$\sigma$ and find $D_{\rm V}/r_{\rm d}(z_{\rm eff} = 1.47) = 24.6 \pm 1.0$.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute the cosmic stellar, dust and neutral gas mass history at $0<z\lesssim3$ using ProSpect spectral energy distribution modelling of $\approx 800 \, 000$ galaxies in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS). The cosmic dust mass history broadly follows the shape of the cosmic star formation history; though, the decline is slower, suggestive of a slowing rate of dust growth and destruction as the star formation declines past its peak at $z\approx 2$. Neutral gas masses were estimated by scaling the dust masses by the metallicity-dependent dust-to-gas ratio. The neutral gas mass density as traced by the dust is an average of $\approx 0.6$ dex lower than that measured from $21$cm experiments, most likely due to differences in the spatial scales inhabited by dust and HI. Folding in measurements of the supermassive black hole mass density obtained previously with similar data and methods, we present a self-consistent census of the baryons confined to galaxies. Stars, neutral gas, SMBHs and dust contained within the optical radii of galaxies account for $\approx 5$ per cent of the baryons. Most of the remaining $\approx 95$ per cent of baryons must be ionised and dispersed throughout the interstellar, circumgalactic and intergalactic media within, around and between galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 According to the classical AGN model, broad emission lines originate from the broad-line region (BLR) and are observable only when the attenuation by the dusty torus is small. However, we recently found several heavily-obscured ($A_V > 50$ mag) AGNs with broad H$\alpha$ detections: MCG -3-34-64, UGC 5101, and Mrk 268. To investigate the origin of the observed broad line in these AGNs, we performed multi-epoch optical spectroscopic observations to search for flux variability of the broad H$\alpha$ line. For MCG -3-34-64 and UGC 5101, no significant variability was detected, suggesting that the broad line of these AGNs may arise from sources other than the BLR. Spectral fitting analysis suggests possible large contribution of ionized outflows to the observed broad component of MCG -3-34-64, while both the outflow and scattering by polar material can explain that of UGC 5101. For Mrk 268, we detected a significant ($4.3\sigma$) flux variation of the broad H$\alpha$ line by using the flux ratio of the H$\alpha$ complex and the [SII]$\lambda\lambda6716$, 6731 doublet, indicating that the broad line originates directly from the BLR. The lack of significant flux variation in the optical continuum implies that the line of sight to the nucleus of Mrk 268 is mildly obscured. Our results demonstrate that the observed broad H$\alpha$ lines in obscured AGNs likely have multiple origins. Such complexity may introduce additional uncertainties in black hole mass measurements of distant AGNs revealed by e.g., JWST.

 - **Abstract**
 The formation channels of binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) network remain uncertain. While BBH mergers occurring inside active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks may interact with surrounding gas and generate observable optical flares. We test this scenario by quantifying the spatial and temporal correlation between BBH events in GWTC-4.0 and AGN flares identified from six years of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) DR23 data. Using 80 BBH mergers selected for adequate localization, redshift reach, observing-epoch overlap, and ZTF sky coverage, we construct a likelihood for the flare-associated fraction, $f_{\rm flare}$, that combines each event's 3D localization with a locally estimated flare number density derived from a 3D Voronoi tessellation, while explicitly accounting for survey boundaries and incomplete catalog coverage. Adopting a 200-day post-merger time window for potential counterparts, we infer $f_{\rm flare} = 0.07_{-0.05}^{+0.25}$ (90\% confidence level). This non-zero maximum-likelihood value is driven primarily by GW190412, for which a single flare candidate (J143041.67+355703.8) is consistent in both time and spatial position. Excluding GW190412 yields results consistent with no association and an upper limit of $f_{\rm flare} < 0.17$ at 90\% confidence level. The intrinsic properties of GW190412 and the characteristics of the candidate host AGN are broadly consistent with theoretical expectations for the AGN-disk formation channel, motivating continued, targeted electromagnetic follow-up of well-localized and highly asymmetric BBH mergers in current and upcoming time-domain surveys.

 - **Abstract**
 PSR J1455$-$3330 is a $\sim$7.98 ms pulsar in a $\sim$76.17 day nearly circular orbit with a white dwarf companion. In this work, we combine the available Lovell, Nançay decimetric Radio Telescope, Green Bank, and MeerKAT pulsar timing data spanning $\sim$ 30 years to measure the kinematic and relativistic effects of PSR J1455$-$3330 to constrain its 3D orbital geometry and component masses. We detect a relativistic Shapiro delay signal. We measure a significant orthometric amplitude $h_3 = 0.307^{+0.022}_{-0.026}$ $\mu$s and an orthometric ratio $\varsigma = 0.551^{+0.057}_{-0.054}$. We measure the change in projected semi-major axis $\dot{x} = -202.1^{+2.5}_{-2.7} \times10^{-16} \, \rm s\,s^{-1}$ with high significance, parallax, $\varpi$ = 1.11(6) mas, parallax derived distance 0.90(5) kpc, and a precise total proper motion magnitude of 12.432(2) mas yr$^{-1}$. A self-consistent analysis of all kinematic and relativistic effects, assuming general relativity, yields two solutions: (1) a pulsar mass $M_{\rm p} = 1.39^{+0.38}_{-0.18}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, a companion mass $M_{\rm c} = 0.293^{+0.056}_{-0.026}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$, an orbital inclination, $i = 63(2)^{\circ}$, and longitude of the ascending node, $\Omega = 212(12)^{\circ}$ or (2) a pulsar mass $M_{\rm p} = 1.53^{+1.10}_{-0.22} \, \rm M_{\odot}$, a companion mass $M_{\rm c} = 0.309^{+0.163}_{-0.026}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, an orbital inclination, $i = 123(4)^{\circ}$, and longitude of the ascending node, $\Omega = 334(12)^{\circ}$. All uncertainties represent the 68.27$\%$ credibility region. These results strongly favour a helium-dominated white dwarf companion.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute the full one-loop corrections to the primordial tensor power spectrum in an inflationary scenario with a non-minimally coupled spectator field, using the in-in formalism. We derive semi-analytic results for the scalar-sourced one-loop tensor spectrum and the effective tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ . We consider two representative coupling functions: a localized Gaussian dip (Model G), which leads to moderate loop corrections, and a rapidly oscillatory coupling (Model O), which can yield much larger loop contributions. For Model G, we find a $\mathcal{O}(1)$ correction to $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ while Model O can significantly enhance $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$ by several orders of magnitude (relative to the tree-level value). We further calculate the energy density of primordial gravitational waves. Assuming that primordial black holes with mass $10^{-12}M_{\odot}$ generated in this scenario, constitute all of the dark matter, we find that the results are several orders of magnitude lower than the sensitivities of Taiji/TianQin/LISA.

 - **Abstract**
 We present new precise measurements of electron temperatures and oxygen abundances in the southeast knot of I Zw 18, one of the most metal-poor blue compact dwarf galaxies known, using spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1). For the first time in I Zw 18, we directly measure electron temperature in the low-ionization zone using the rarely detected [O II] $\lambda\lambda7320,7330$ doublet. We also detect the auroral lines [O III] $\lambda4363$ and [S III] $\lambda6312$, associated with high and intermediate ionization zones, respectively. We derive $T_{\mathrm{e}}([\mathrm{O}\,\mathrm{III}])=21\,200\pm860\ \mathrm{K}$, $T_{\mathrm{e}}([\mathrm{O}\,\mathrm{II}])=16\,170\pm950\ \mathrm{K}$, and $T_{\mathrm{e}}([\mathrm{S}\,\mathrm{III}])=17\,290\pm1750\ \mathrm{K}$, highlighting a significant temperature difference between ionization zones. Using these direct temperature measurements, we determine a total oxygen abundance of $12+\log(\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{H})=7.066\pm0.046$, $\log(\mathrm{N}/\mathrm{O})=-1.509\pm0.097$, and $\log(\mathrm{S}/\mathrm{O})=-1.558\pm0.041$. Our results extend the calibration of $t_2$--$t_3$ relations to the highest temperatures, providing important anchor points for the temperature structure of extremely metal-poor H II regions, including high-redshift galaxies where direct temperature measurements are especially challenging.

 - **Abstract**
 To reproduce observed galaxy properties, cosmological simulations require that massive galaxies experience feedback from active galactic nuclei, which regulates star formation within those galaxies. However, the energetics and timescales of these feedback processes are poorly constrained. We combine optical, infrared, sub-millimeter and radio observations of the active galaxy VV 340a, hosting a low-power jet launched from a supermassive black hole at its center. We find that the jet undergoes precession, with a period of (8.2 $\pm~$5.5) $\times~$10$^5$ years, and drives an outflow of gas at a rate of 19.4 $\pm~$7.9 solar masses per year. The jet shocks the gas, producing highly ionized plasma extending several kiloparsecs from the nucleus. The outflow ejects sufficient gas from the galaxy to influence its star formation rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Repeated black-hole mergers in dense stellar clusters are a plausible mechanism to populate the predicted gap in black hole masses due to the pair-instability process. These hierarchical mergers carry distinct spin and tilt features relative to first-generation black holes, for which previous studies have found evidence at a population level by interpreting features in the effective inspiral spin domain. We introduce an astrophysically-motivated model in the joint space of effective inspiral and precessing spins, which captures the dominant spin dynamics expected for hierarchical mergers. We find decisive evidence both for a population transition above $\sim 45M_\odot$, consistent with the anticipated onset of the pair-instability gap, as well as a peak at $\sim 15 M_\odot$, which we interpret as the global peak in the hierarchical merger rate. The existence of low- and high-mass subpopulations of higher-generation black holes suggests the contribution of both near-solar-metallicity and metal-poor star clusters to the hierarchical merger population. Our results reinforce the growing evidence for detailed, mass-dependent substructure in the spin distribution of the binary black hole population.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the quantum structure of black hole interiors in Horava-Lifshitz gravity by analyzing the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in minisuperspace. Focusing on the ultraviolet regime, where higher-order spatial curvature terms dominate, we derive analytical solutions in this UV limit for both the original Horava-Lifshitz action and its analytically continued counterpart. We study their behavior near the event horizon and the classical singularity, with particular attention to the interpretation of the wave function in terms of the annihilation-to-nothing scenario proposed in general relativity. In this paper, we have considered cases in which the two-dimensional spatial section is spherical, planar, or hyperbolic, as well as models with positive, negative, or vanishing cosmological constant. In all cases, we find that the terms dominating in the ultraviolet regime, together with the effects of the running scaling parameter, act to suppress the annihilation-to-nothing behavior. These results suggest that, at least within the range explored in this study, the characteristic annihilation-to-nothing behavior does not appear in the ultraviolet regime of Horava-Lifshitz gravity, and provide a new perspective on the understanding of singularity resolution in quantum gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a novel exact solution of the Einstein-scalar-Maxwell equations describing a dynamical black hole immersed in an external, time-dependent electromagnetic field. Motivated by the need for more realistic analytical black hole models, our construction incorporates two key ingredients often neglected in exact solutions: a fully dynamical cosmological background and the non-perturbative backreaction of external electromagnetic fields. The compact object is obtained by dressing a Schwarzschild black hole with a radially and temporally dependent scalar field, yielding a time-dependent generalization of the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution within the Fonarev framework. The external electromagnetic field is generated via a Lie point symmetry of the Einstein-scalar-Maxwell system, which exports the effect of a Harrison transformation to dynamical settings provided a spacelike Killing vector is present. The resulting spacetime combines a spherically symmetric dynamical horizon with an axisymmetric electromagnetic field and exhibits a rich asymptotic structure mixing Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker and Levi-Civita geometries. We show that the time dependence of the configuration plays a crucial role in potentially cloaking curvature singularities, which would otherwise be generically naked in the stationary limit. We analyze the geometric and physical properties of the solution, including its asymptotic behavior, algebraic classification, and the structure of trapped surfaces defining the dynamical horizon. Possible implications for primordial black holes and some astrophysical applications, as well as extensions to higher dimensions, are also discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We obtain the metric which describes the spacetime corresponding to the Frolov black hole in the presence of a cloud of strings and discuss how this cloud affects the regularity of the solution and the energy conditions. In addition, we analyze geodesics, effective potential, and several thermodynamic aspects. Finally, we compare our results with the corresponding findings in the literature for the original Frolov black hole, that is, in the absence of a cloud of strings

 - **Abstract**
 As is well known, near-horizon (equivalently high acceleration) observers in spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes have a particularly simple form of the quasi-local energy. Using this energy and indistinguishable area quanta satisfying quantum statistics a statistical mechanical description of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry for uniformly accelerating observers is developed. The resulting model has several phases including one with highly excited states, Bose-Einstein condensates, condensates distinct from the usual Bose gas, and degenerate Fermi gases. In the large area limit, relevant for comparison to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, the new condensed state is favored over Bose-Einstein condensation and the degenerate Fermi gas. The entropies of the phases, and the entropy of mixing, are computed. The resulting low-entropic condensed state, where the quanta are essentially all in the lowest Bose energy state, provides the framework for the quantization of near-horizon geometric fluctuations, which is explored in a companion paper.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole entropy is identified with the counting of the dynamical degrees of freedom of trapped gravitational modes continually sourced by the Hawking-Unruh process. In the context of linear perturbations of Schwarzschild spacetime the density of states is derived from the orthogonality of states in the solution space of the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equation. The otherwise divergent energy and entropy is cutoff by the Planck scale closest approach of constantly accelerating observers near the horizon. The thermal distribution of the trapped modes, which represent shape fluctuations in the near horizon geometry, store a significant fraction of the spacetime mass as observed from far away. Unlike quasi-normal modes the modes are not directly observable outside of $\sim 3 M$ but, being external to the horizon, they affect the propagation of null rays near the black hole. The characteristic frequencies, around 100 Hz for solar mass black holes, are discussed in relation to possible observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Symmetries and conservation laws are studied for a generalized Westervelt equation which is a nonlinear partial differential equation modelling the propagation of sound waves in a compressible medium. This nonlinear wave equation is widely used in nonlinear acoustics and it is especially important in biomedical applications such as ultra-sound imaging in human tissue. Modern methods are applied to uncover point symmetries and conservation laws that can lead to useful developments concerning solutions and their properties. A complete classification of point symmetries is shown for the arbitrary function. Local low-order conservation laws related to net mass of sound waves are obtained by the multiplier method. Two potential systems are derived yielding potential symmetries and nonlocal conservation laws. For the physical case interesting for this equation, travelling wave solutions are studied leading to shock waves.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the algebra of observables of perturbative quantum gravity in the exterior of a stationary black hole or the static patch of de Sitter spacetime. It was previously argued that the backreaction of gravitons on the spacetime perturbs the area of the horizon at second-order which gives rise to a non-trivial constraint on the algebra of physical observables in the subregion. The corresponding "dressed" algebra including fluctuations of the total horizon area admits a well-defined trace and is Type II. In this paper we show that, at the same perturbative order at which the horizon area (and angular momentum) fluctuates, gravitational backreaction also perturbs the horizon area in an angle-dependent way. These fluctuations are encoded in horizon charges -- i.e., "edge modes" -- which are related to an infinite dimensional "boost supertranslation" symmetry of the horizon. Together, these charges impose an infinite family of nontrivial constraints on the gravitational algebra. We construct the full algebra of observables which satisfies these constraints. We argue that the resulting algebra is Type II and its trace is shown to take a universal form. The entropy of any "semiclassical state" is the generalized entropy with an additional "edge mode" contribution as well as a state-independent constant. For any black hole spacetime, the algebra has no maximum entropy state and is Type II$_{\infty}$. In de Sitter, the static patch is defined relative to the worldline of a localized "observer". We show that a consistent quantization of the static-patch algebra requires a more realistic model of the observer, in which higher multipole moments perturb the "shape" of the cosmological horizon. We argue that a proper account of the observer's rotational kinetic energy and (non-gravitational) binding energy implies that the algebra is of Type II$_{1}$ and thereby admits a maximum entropy state.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the kinematics and dynamics of subregion algebras in classical and perturbative quantum gravity associated with portions of null surfaces such as event horizons and finite causal diamonds. We construct half-sided supertranslation generators by extending subregion phase spaces of the event horizon to include doubled pairs of corner edge modes obtained from splitting the horizon, namely relative boosts and null translations of the respective corners. These edge modes carry a corner symplectic form and give rise to canonical charges generating half-sided boosts and translations. We show that the null translation generator is necessarily two-sided in the complementary translation edge modes. The charges act nontrivially on gravitationally dressed local observables on the horizon, such that the horizon subalgebra naturally takes the form of a crossed product by the associated automorphism group. Quantizing the extended phase space after linearizing around a black hole background, we obtain for each horizon cut a Type II$_{\infty}$ von Neumann algebra equipped with a trace, whose von Neumann entropy coincides with the generalized entropy of that cut. The integrability of the half-sided null translation generator lifts to the existence of a self-adjoint operator that implements null time evolution on the Type II$_\infty$ horizon subalgebras. The area operator is identified as the bulk implementation of the Connes cocycle flow for one-sided observables in excited states. The nesting property of the resulting one-parameter family of horizon subalgebras implies a generalized second law for non-stationary linearized perturbations of Killing horizons. Lastly, we use gravitational half-sided modular inclusion algebras to prove the quantum focusing conjecture in the perturbative quantum gravity regime.

 - **Abstract**
 In this note we explore computational algebraic geometry techniques to compute $14^{th}$ Helicity Trace Index of 4--charge, $\frac{1}{8}$--BPS, $\mathcal{N}=8$ pure D-brane configurations dual to D1--D5--P--KK monopole dyonic black holes. We extend the analysis of our previous work \cite{Chowdhury:2023wss} to higher values of charges and fix subtleties involving compatible gauge choices for $(1,1,1,N)$ charge configurations. For explicit SUSY state counting, we use a parametric monodromy method for the 4--charge $(1,1,1,5)$ and $(1,1,1,6)$ configurations and find that the results match the U--dual picture. By a different choice of the R--symmetry representations, it is possible to explicitly break all supersymmetry and study (non--)abelian static matrix models versions as 4--charge non--BPS pure D-brane systems \cite{Mondal:2024qyn}. Using analytical Gröbner bases we show that the potential has no zero energy configuration. The higher end of the spectrum asymptotes towards the Coulomb branch local minima manifold representing unbounded D--brane configurations, and the Mixed branch global minima represent bound states at parametrically lower values of the potential. We developed physics--inspired computational techniques to deform the potentials and lift the flat directions, thereby counting the low--energy states with degeneracy.

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational dynamics of 3+1 dimensional covariant quantum spacetime in the IKKT or IIB matrix model is studied at one loop, combining the Yang-Mills-type matrix action with the induced Einstein-Hilbert action. This combined action leads to interesting modifications of the gravitational dynamics at long distances, governed by modified Einstein equations including an extra geometrical tensor interpreted as ''mirage matter''. In particular we find extra non-Ricci flat geometric modes with a non-standard dispersion relation, with features reminiscent of dark matter.
