#### Black Holes in Globular Clusters: A Structural and Kinematic Perspective

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes (BHs) play a major role in the structural and dynamical evolutions of Globular Clusters (GCs). Several recent works searched for BHs in Galactic GCs using scaling relations derived from numerical simulations. However, the conclusions drawn by such approaches are strongly dependent on the specific prescriptions adopted in numerical simulations. Therefore, we analyzed a survey of 101 Monte Carlo simulations to identify some observable parameters that allow us to probe the present-day BH population in GCs reliably. We thoroughly show that a single observable is not suited to infer the BH mass fraction in real GCs: similar values could be attained by systems with different BH mass fractions, depending on the specific dynamical evolution of the system. Finally, we present a combination of observable parameters that efficiently breaks this degeneracy. We also compare values from numerical simulations with a sample of Galactic GCs.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the orbital eccentricity evolution of supermassive black hole binaries within galactic environments. We analyze the dynamics in triaxial merger remnants and subsequent interactions with geometrically thick nuclear discs. We confirm that gravitational torques in triaxial potentials efficiently extract angular momentum, resulting in binary formation with high initial eccentricities. We then analyze the binary-disc interaction using a 3D analytical framework incorporating the Airy formalism and potential softening. We present a self-consistent derivation demonstrating that the 3D suppression of high-order torques leads to distinct scalings with disc thickness ($h$): migration rates $\tau_a^{-1} \propto h^{-3}$ and eccentricity damping rates $\tau_e^{-1} \propto h^{-5}$. This establishes a timescale hierarchy, $\tau_e/\tau_a \propto h^2$. For typical parameters ($h\approx 0.2$), eccentricity damping is significantly faster than orbital decay ($\tau_e \approx 0.04 \, \tau_a$). We further develop a wavelet-based formalism to quantify the impact of disc inhomogeneities arising from accretion feedback and turbulence. We derive the stochastic torque variance in the wavelet domain and employ a Fokker-Planck analysis to determine the equilibrium eccentricity distribution. While stochastic fluctuations counteract deterministic damping, the strong damping imposed by the thick disc geometry ensures the equilibrium eccentricity remains small unless the fluctuations are highly non-linear. Hence, even if born highly eccentric, SMBHBs are rapidly circularized. This circularization trap forces binaries to approach the gravitational wave-dominated regime on nearly circular orbits, prolonging the total merger timescale. This introduces a substantial cosmological delay governed by stellar relaxation, which impacts detection rates and the modeling of SMBH assembly in cosmological frameworks.

#### Multi-species Dark Matter with Warmth and Randomness
 - **Authors:** Mustafa A. Amin, M. Sten Delos, Kiaxin Yang
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15046

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15046

 - **Abstract**
 We present a general analytic framework for the evolution of cosmic structure in multi-species dark matter models that simultaneously incorporates finite velocity dispersion and Poisson fluctuations. Our approach accommodates arbitrary numbers of dark matter components with distinct mass fractions, velocity distributions, and number densities -- ranging from cold particles to warm species and sparse populations such as primordial black holes or solitons. The framework is based on solving a truncated BBGKY hierarchy, whose solution is obtained by solving Volterra integral equations. We provide an efficient algorithm to solve for the total, as well as inter- and intra-species power spectra. Worked examples with two-component mixtures illustrate how isocurvature (initially Poisson) and adiabatic spectra evolve differently depending on the properties of the warm or sparse fraction. This evolution is controlled by the free-streaming and Jeans scales, and the results match analytic estimates and $N$-body simulations.

#### Implications of a high growth index on the variation of $G$
 - **Authors:** Ícaro. B. S. Cortês, Léo. G. Medeiros, Ronaldo C. Batista
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15054

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15054

 - **Abstract**
 A recent determination of the growth index indicates a value significantly higher than the $\Lambda$CDM prediction, suggesting that alternative scenarios to $\Lambda$CDM may be required. In this work, we investigate whether a time-varying Newton's constant, $G_N$, can account for such a high growth index, $\gamma=0.063\pm0.025$. Adopting a phenomenological approach, we study two parameterizations of the effective gravitational coupling, $G_{\rm eff}$, one based on a Taylor expansion and another linked to the energy density parameter of Dark Energy. We constrain the models with Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument baryon acoustic oscillations (data release 2), CMB priors, and a gaussian likelihood for the growth index. We show that the constant $\gamma$ approximation is accurate for the parametrization linked to the energy density parameter of dark energy, but presents a non-negligible error for the other case, which we treat as a systematic error in the analysis. We find a $2.4\sigma-3.4\sigma$ tension level with constant $G_{\rm eff}$, depending on the parametrization. The results indicate that $G_{\rm eff}<G_N$ around the period of accelerated expansion, corresponding to a weaker effective gravitational interaction on cosmological scales, which leads to a suppression of the growth of cosmological structures.

#### Exploring Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation in Composite Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson Models: Implications for Primordial Black Holes and Gravitational Waves
 - **Authors:** Marco Merchand

Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15460

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15460

 - **Abstract**
 We study inflation driven by a scalar potential arising from composite-sector dynamics, inspired by generalized composite Higgs models. The introduction of a non-minimal coupling, possessing the same functional form as the potential, induces a flattening at large field values that enables successful inflation. We analyze the conditions for ultra-slow-roll inflation, which leads to enhanced curvature perturbations, by combining analytical criteria near the inflection point with comprehensive numerical scans of the parameter space. The region consistent with Cosmic Microwave Background constraints and yielding approximately $N_e \approx 55\text{-}60$ e-folds also predicts primordial black holes with masses in the range $10^3\text{-}10^5\,\mathrm{g}$. Although such ultra-light primordial black holes are typically expected to have evaporated, recent proposals invoking evaporation suppression via memory-burden effects could allow their survival as viable dark matter candidates. Under this assumption, the induced gravitational wave signal peaks in a frequency gap between standard interferometers and resonant-cavity experiments, motivating exploration of this observational frontier.

#### Strong gravitational-wave lensing posterior odds

 - **Abstract**
 Like light, gravitational waves are gravitationally lensed by intervening massive astrophysical objects, such as galaxies, clusters, black holes, and stars, resulting in a variety of potentially observable gravitational-wave lensing signatures. Searches for gravitational-wave lensing by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration have begun. One common method focuses on strong gravitational-wave lensing, which produces multiple "images": repeated copies of the same gravitational wave that differ only in amplitude, arrival time, and overall "Morse phase." The literature identifies two separate approaches to identifying such repeated gravitational-wave events based on frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Several works have discussed selection effects and identified challenges similar to the well-known "birthday problem", namely, the rapidly increasing likelihood of false alarms in an ever-growing catalogue of event pairs. Here, we discuss these problems, unify the different approaches in Bayesian language, and derive the posterior odds for strong lensing. In particular, the Bayes factor and prior odds are sensitive to the number of gravitational-wave events in the data, but the posterior odds are insensitive to it once strong lensing time delays are accounted for. We confirm Lo et al.'s (2020) finding that selection effects enter the Bayes factor as an overall normalisation constant. However, this factor cancels out in the posterior odds and does not affect frequentist approaches to strong lensing detection.

#### J-GEM near-infrared follow-up observations of the gravitational wave event S240422ed

 - **Abstract**
 We report our near-infrared (NIR) follow-up observations of the gravitational wave (GW) event S240422ed using the Subaru Telescope/MOIRCS. S240422ed was initially classified as a black hole-neutron star merger with $>$ 99% probability of electromagnetic wave emission. We started follow-up observations 7.8 hours after the event. Over two nights, we observed 206 nearby galaxies in $Y$ and $K_{\rm s}$ bands down to about 21.4 and 21.1 AB mag (3$\sigma$), respectively. The total completeness of our survey based on galaxy $B$-band luminosity is 22%. As a result of our observations, five candidate counterparts were identified. We show that properties of these five objects are not consistent with kilonova such as AT2017gfo. Four objects are consistent with known classes of transients such as supernovae or dwarf nova outbursts. On the other hand, the nature of the remaining one object, which shows a red color and rapid decline, remains unclear. Although later analyses of GW signal reclassified S240422ed as likely terrestrial noise, our NIR observations provide valuable lessons for future NIR surveys for GW sources. We demonstrate that deep NIR follow-up observations as presented in this work would effectively constrain the presence of red kilonova even at 200 Mpc distance. We also discuss the importance of deep and wide NIR reference images and of understanding the properties and frequency of Galactic transients.

#### Transverse BAO scale measurement at $z_{\rm eff} = 1.725$ with the SDSS quasars catalog

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15650

 - **Abstract**
 Studying the SDSS-DR16 quasar catalog, we detect a baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal in the two-point angular correlation function with a statistical significance of $3\sigma$, at an effective redshift of $z_{\rm eff}=1.725$. Using a simple parameterization-comprising a polynomial plus a Gaussian function-we measure the transverse BAO scale as $\theta_{\rm BAO}=1.928^{\circ}\pm0.094^{\circ}$. This measurement is obtained from a narrow redshift shell, $z \in [1.72, 1.73]$ (i.e., $\Delta z=0.01$), thin enough that projection-effect corrections are negligible, making it only weakly dependent on the assumed fiducial cosmology. The only assumption adopted is isotropy in the computation of the correlation function, further ensuring that the result depends only weakly on specific cosmological-model hypotheses. We also investigate possible systematics that could affect the detection or significance of the BAO signal and find them to be subdominant or implausible. When combined with other transverse BAO measurements from the literature, our result shows good concordance-within the $1\sigma$ confidence level-with the cosmological parameter values reported by the Planck and DESI collaborations. This new measurement of the transverse BAO scale, obtained from the SDSS quasar sample with minimal cosmological-model assumptions, provides an additional independent constraint for updated statistical studies aimed at probing the nature of dark energy.

#### Constraints on neutrino mass and dark energy agnostic to the sound horizon

 - **Abstract**
 Recent BAO observations from DESI DR2 either hint at a possible dynamical dark energy component, which would worsen the Hubble tension, or at a 95\% credible interval for the summed neutrino mass hardly compatible with neutrino oscillation experiments. In this context, it is interesting to investigate constraints on neutrino masses, dark energy and the Hubble parameter that are agnostic to some aspects of the cosmological model. Here we choose to be agnostic to the value of the sound horizon at recombination, while sticking to standard assumptions regarding the time of recombination and the growth of structures. To be consistent, we also disregard information on the full shape of the CMB temperature and polarization spectrum on sub-degree scale. With such agnostic and conservative assumptions, we find that: (i) the dark energy evolution is well constrained by uncalibrated data on angular and luminosity distances, with a mild preference for dynamical dark energy, independently of the value of the sound horizon; (ii) large values of the Hubble rate are favored, $H_0=76.0^{+4.5}_{-4.3}$ km/s/Mpc (68\%CL), together with low values of the sound horizon, $r_{\rm s}=129.2^{+6.7}_{-8.1}$ Mpc (68\%CL); the SH0ES value of $H_0$ is thus marginally preferred over the low value returned by the standard inverse distance ladder analysis; (iii) the cosmological neutrino mass bound relaxes to $\sum m_\nu <1.6$ eV (95\%CL) and becomes well compatible with the normal and inverted neutrino mass schemes.

#### The Missing Multipole Problem: Investigating biases from model starting frequency in gravitational-wave analyses

 - **Abstract**
 Our ability to infer the true source properties of colliding black holes from gravitational wave observations requires not only accurate waveform models but also their correct use. A key property when evaluating time-domain models is when to start the waveform: choosing a time that is too late can omit low-frequency power from higher order multipoles. By focusing on binary systems with total mass $\ge 200 \, M_{\odot}$, we show that current detectors are sensitive to this missing power and biased source properties can be obtained. We show that for systems with total mass $\lesssim 300 \, M_{\odot}$, mass ratio $\gtrsim 0.33$, and signal-to-noise ratio $\rho \gtrsim 20$, templates starting at $20 \, \mathrm{Hz}$ recover biased source properties. As the total mass increases, and the component masses become more asymmetric, templates starting from $13 \, \mathrm{Hz}$ recover biased properties. If the gravitational-wave signal is observed at signal-to-noise ratio $\rho < 20$, time-domain models can start from $20\, \mathrm{Hz}$ as statistical uncertainties dominate.

#### Hints for dynamical dark energy from warm inflation

 - **Abstract**
 The effect of dissipation from the thermal bath of minimal warm inflation (MWI) on the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is investigated. A shift in the phase and peaks of the theoretical TT mode angular power spectrum of CMB for MWI with increasing dissipation strength hints at the dynamical nature of dark energy from warm inflation. Outcome of the study highlights the necessity of modifying the cosmological parameters, signalling a physics beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model of cosmology. The current findings may open a new direction for explaining the increased expansion rate in the early universe, thus alleviating some of the persistent tensions in cosmology, especially the Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we have constructed anisotropic bosonic dark-matter star (DMS) solutions in the context of a regularized four-dimensional Einstein$-$Gauss$-$Bonnet (4D EGB) gravity theory. Using dimensional regularization, we solve modified Tolman$-$Oppenheimer$-$Volkoff equations for a self-interacting complex scalar field in the dilute polytropic regime, $p_r = K \rho^2$, with anisotropy parameterized as $\sigma = \beta\, p_r \left( 1 - e^{-2\lambda} \right)$. We perform a comprehensive numerical analysis across the \((\alpha,\beta)\) parameter domain, where \(\alpha \in [0,8]~\mathrm{km}^2\) and \(\beta \in [-2,0]\), to examine mass$-$radius relations and evaluate multiple stability indicators including static equilibrium \(dM/dp_c\), sound-speed causality, the radial adiabatic index \(\Gamma_r\), and energy conditions. Positive Gauss$-$Bonnet coupling enhances both the maximum mass and compactness (e.g., \(M_{\rm max} \approx 1.62\, M_\odot\) at \(\alpha=0\) rising to \(\approx 2.09\, M_\odot\) at \(\alpha = 8~\mathrm{km}^2\)), while negative anisotropy reduces them (e.g., from \(\approx 2.21\, M_\odot\) at \(\beta=0\) to \(\approx 1.73\, M_\odot\) at \(\beta = -2\)). The resulting configurations remain statically stable up to the mass peak and satisfy physical criteria. This work extends previous isotropic boson-star analyses by systematically incorporating anisotropy within a regularized 4D EGB framework. These findings provide observationally relevant predictions for compact dark-matter objects under modified gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider massless scalar field perturbations of regular black holes in quasi-topological gravity. After reviewing various regular black hole solutions, we compute the total absorption cross-section and the partial absorption cross-section for different choices of the parameters using the partial wave method. The results show that the larger the parameter ${\alpha}$, introduced in the context of quasi-topological gravity, the smaller the total absorption cross-section. In addition, we find that the influence of the space-time dimension ${D}$ on the absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves in this set of regular black holes differs from earlier computations.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper explores the metric of Piero Nicolini's noncommutative black hole spacetime, calculates its effective potential, and presents the corresponding potential curve. By analyzing this curve, we identify various orbit types for test particles and photons in this spacetime. Using the dynamical equations for particles and photons near the black hole, we plot the specific time-like and null geodesic structures. We analyze the impact of different values of the total mass of the source $M$ and angular momentum $L$ on time-like geodesics. Our results indicate that in the Piero black hole spacetime, increases in total mass and angular momentum reduce the perihelion precession rate of the orbit. Notably, the effect of total mass is nonlinear, while the effect of angular momentum is linear.

 - **Abstract**
 How important are gravitational and relativistic effects for interstellar travel? We consider this question in the context of proposed laser-propelled spacecraft missions to neighboring stellar destinations. Our analysis applies to any spacecraft traveling at relativistic speeds. As a concrete example, we focus on a mission to Proxima Centauri b -- a terrestrial-sized planet in the habitable zone around our nearest stellar neighbor, Proxima Centauri. We employ a Julia reimplementation of the PoMiN code, an N-body code modeling relativistic gravitational dynamics in the first post-Minkowskian (PM) approximation to general relativity (valid to linear order in Newton's constant $G$). We compute the gravitational influence of seven different celestial bodies and find that the Sun has the greatest influence on the trajectory of the interstellar spacecraft. We also study the differences between Newtonian and PM gravity, and find that if mission planners wish to hit Proxima Centauri b with an accuracy of better than about 690,000 kilometers, relativistic effects must be taken into account. To solve for the precise initial data needed to hit an intended target, we develop numerical fine-tuning methods and demonstrate that these methods can (within a given model) be precise to about a femtometer over a travel distance of $\sim4.25$ light years. However, we find that for the spacecraft trajectories we consider, higher order general relativistic effects (beyond the first PM approximation) from the Sun can displace the final position of the spacecraft by tens of kilometers. We also consider the variation in the initial direction of the spacecraft velocity and find that, even with relativistic effects properly taken into account, the miss distances can be dominated by the variation in the initial velocity that could arise from errors during the launch and boost phase of the spacecraft mission.

#### Exact solutions for the relativistic dynamics of a self-consistent system with electromagnetic and gravitational interaction within the Wigner-Vlasov formalism

 - **Abstract**
 This work derives exact solutions to the problem of interacting particle density evolution in relativistic and quasi-relativistic approximations for electromagnetic and gravitational interactions. Two types of radial symmetry for the initial density distribution are considered: spherical and cylindrical. It is shown that the relativistic effect delays the onset of the shock wave moment, and in some cases removes it entirely or, conversely, can facilitate it. The analysis of the system's dynamics is carried out within the Wigner-Vlasov formalism, which makes it possible to extend the obtained solutions to quantum systems, including those with gravitational interaction. The derived exact solutions can be directly used as a cross-check for modeling and optimizing nonlinear problems of beam dynamics with account for space charge, astrophysics, plasma physics, and quantum systems with a shock wave.

#### Discretization of Variable-Coefficient Dynamical Systems via Rota Algebras

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel integrability-preserving discretization for a broad class of differential equations with variable coefficients, encompassing both linear and nonlinear cases. The construction is achieved via a categorical approach that enables a unified treatment of continuous and discrete dynamical systems. Within our theoretical framework, based on the finite operator calculus proposed by G. C. Rota, all difference operators act as derivations in an algebra of power series with respect to a suitable functional product. The core of our theory relies on the existence of covariant functors between the newly proposed Rota category of Galois differential algebras and suitable categories of abstract dynamical systems. In this setting, under certain regularity assumptions, a differential equation and its discrete analogues are naturally interpreted as objects of the same category. This perspective enables the construction of a vast class of integrable maps that share with their continuous analogues a wide set of exact solutions and, in the linear case, the Picard-Vessiot group.

 - **Abstract**
 Attempts to construct a low-temperature version of the fluid/gravity correspondence have faced obstacles manifested in the form of logarithmic terms in the frequency, $\log(\omega)$, leading to non-local in time constitutive relations for the stress tensor and the charge current. These difficulties can be broadly presented as a breakdown of the hydrodynamic description due to additional infrared modes. We employ new quantum insights into the physics of near-extremal black holes, brought about in the context of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, as an effective description of quantum fluctuations in the throat, to revisit the fluid/gravity correspondence at very low temperatures. The quantum corrections naturally include a new length scale, $C$, and an effective action that parametrizes the breaking of near-horizon symmetries. We show that with an appropriate choice of order of limits in the derivative expansion within the low-temperature regime, the $\log(\omega)$ infrared divergence can be resolved. By quantum averaging the infrared Schwarzian modes as an effective extra contribution to the long-wavelength fluid modes, the resulting low-temperature effective fluid description is consistent. We present the dispersion relations for all the relevant hydrodynamic modes. We also revisit the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio and find that at very low temperatures the universal $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ bound is violated due to quantum correction.
