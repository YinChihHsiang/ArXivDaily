 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations have revealed a population of red, compact, high-redshift objects called 'Little Red Dots'(LRD), whose host components have remained largely unconstrained, possibly due to their extreme compactness. Current morphological studies have been limited by small samples, as well as by insufficient imaging depth, which may not allow reliable separation between point-like and extended components, leaving the existence and properties of extended components in LRD largely unconstrained. Here, we perform the image stacking analysis of 217 LRDs in four NIRCam bands, representing the largest and homogeneous sample observed from COSMOS-Web survey to date. Our results reveal an unambiguous detection of faint extended emission in the F444W band, with a typical size of ~200 parsecs and magnitude of ~27.7 AB at z~6.5. We perform four-band photometric SED fitting based on galaxy templates and derive a stellar mass of 8.91+-~0.1 logM_sun. Given this stellar mass, the host galaxy is compact, i.e., ~2.5 times smaller than star-forming populations at similar mass, and the typical black hole mass of LRDs is elevated by ~1.5 dex above the local MBH-M* relation. This work provides direct observational evidence for the existence of LRD host galaxies and offers crucial insights into the growth of the host galaxy and the co-evolution of galaxies and their black holes within the first billion years after the Big Bang.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the relationship between disc winds, radio jets, accretion rates and black hole masses of a sample of $\sim$100k quasars at z $\approx$ 2. Combining spectra from the 17th data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with radio fluxes from the 2nd data release of the Low Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS), we statistically characterise a radio loud and radio quiet population using a two-component Gaussian Mixture model, and perform population matching in black hole mass and Eddington fraction. We determine how the fraction of radio loud sources changes across this parameter space, finding that jets are most efficiently produced in quasars with either a very massive central black hole ($M_{\textrm{BH}} > 10^9 \textrm{M}_{\odot}$) or one that is rapidly accreting ($\lambda_{\textrm{Edd}}>0.3$). We also show that there are differences in the blueshift of the CIV $\lambda$1549Å line and the equivalent width of the HeII $\lambda$1640Å line in radio loud and radio quiet quasars that persist even after accounting for differences in the mass and accretion rate of the central black hole. Generally, we find an anti-correlation between the inferred presence of disc winds and jets, which we suggest is mediated by differences in the quasars' spectral energy distributions. The latter result is shown through the close coupling between tracers of wind kinematics and the ionising flux-- which holds for both radio loud and radio quiet sources, despite differences between their emission line properties-- and is hinted at by a different Baldwin effect in the two populations.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetically arrested disks (MADs) are a compelling model for explaining variability in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN), including horizon-scale outbursts like those observed in Sagittarius A*. MADs experience powerful flux eruptions-episodic ejections of magnetic flux from the black hole horizon-that may drive the observed luminosity variations. In this work, we develop and validate a new formalism describing large-scale magnetic field transport in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of MADs with geometrical thicknesses of $h/R=0.1$ and $h/R=0.3$. We introduce a net flux transport velocity, $v_\Phi$, which accounts for both advective and diffusive processes. We show that MADs maintain a statistical quasi-steady state where advection and diffusion nearly balance. Flux eruptions appear as small deviations from this equilibrium, with $v_\Phi/V_k\ll1$, where $V_k$ is the local Keplerian velocity. Using this framework, we analytically derive a recurrence timescale for flux eruptions, $t_{\rm rec}\sim1500\, r_g/c$. This timescale closely matches simulation results. The smallness of $v_\Phi$ explains the long recurrence times of flux eruptions compared to other system timescales. We also take a closer look at the diffusion of the magnetic field by performing the first measurement of turbulent resistivity in MADs. We then estimate the turbulent magnetic Prandtl number, defined as the ratio of turbulent viscosity to turbulent resistivity. We find $\mathcal{P}_m\sim3$, consistent with shearing-box simulations of magneto rotational instability-driven turbulence. While flux eruptions excite large-scale non-axisymmetric modes and locally enhance turbulent resistivity, magnetic field diffusion is dominated by smaller-scale turbulent motions. These results provide new insight into the nature of AGN variability and the fundamental physics of magnetic field transport.

 - **Abstract**
 The Chandra X-ray Observatory is a mainstay of modern observational astrophysics. With the highest angular resolution of any X-ray facility, its imaging and spectral capabilities in the 0.5-10 keV band have led to both unique and complementary breakthroughs in nearly all areas of the field. Now more than a quarter century into its mission, Chandra continues to provide unique information on the contributions of compact objects to the evolution of galaxies, the nature of supernova explosions, the impact of energetic jets from supermassive black holes on their host environments, and the fate of exoplanet atmospheres in systems rich with stellar flares. Here we provide a summary of Chandra results - one that is embarrassingly incomplete, but representative of both the exquisite past and promising future for Chandra's contributions to high energy astrophysics and all of mainstream astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass compact objects (COs) embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs are commonly assumed to accrete via Bondi or Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) prescriptions, neglecting gas angular momentum. We show that differential rotation in AGN discs can impart non-negligible angular momentum, in which case accretion proceeds through a viscous disc rather than Bondi/BHL flow. Our model provides a new framework estimating the CO accretion rate as $\dot{M}_\mathrm{CO} = \min\{\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis}, \dot{M}_\mathrm{BHL}\}$, where the viscous rate $\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis}$ accounts for gas--CO relative motion decomposed into a local gradient term (due to differential rotation) and bulk motion (from differing orbital parameters). This rate can be expressed as $\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis} = \alpha \xi (r_\mathrm{H}/r_\mathrm{BHL})^3\dot{M}_\mathrm{BHL}$, where $\xi$ is a coefficient of order unity. It can also be approximately scaled to the global AGN accretion rate as $\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis} \propto \dot{M}_1$, with the scaling coefficients in both forms determined by the specific dynamical configuration. The accretion is viscosity-limited when $q > [\alpha \xi(1+\mathcal{M}^2)^{3}/3]^{1/2} h^3$, where $q$ is the mass ratio between the CO and the supermassive black hole, $\alpha$ the viscosity parameter, $\mathcal{M}$ the Mach number of the bulk relative motion, and $h$ the aspect ratio of the AGN disc. In thin AGN discs this condition is satisfied for most stellar-mass or more massive COs. Our framework also naturally allows for the inclusion of established outflow corrections, thereby enabling a more realistic treatment of super-Eddington flows. Our formulation thus improves upon Bondi/BHL prescriptions and offers a more physically motivated basis for studying CO evolution in AGN environments.

 - **Abstract**
 The interplay between the accretion of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the stellar mass growth of the host galaxies is still a matter of hot debate. The accretion of the SMBHs is expected to release energy under the form of AGNs. This energy is believed to impact the star formation activity and contribute to the quenching of galaxies. Here, we address this key unsolved issue with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE. In DECODE, we grow galaxies with their SFR linked to halo accretion rate distributions via abundance matching. SMBHs are evolved following the stellar mass growth of their host galaxies by assigning an accretion rate at each redshift from the empirical Eddington ratio distributions and duty cycles. We test the assumption that galaxies permanently quench when their central SMBHs approach the limit imposed by the observed $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_\star$ relation, as a proxy of SMBH disruptive feedback. We find that simply imposing the $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_\star$ condition is sufficient to generate a fraction of quenched galaxies consistent with current data, including the newest ones from Euclid. In addition, our minimal, data-driven model, also predicts SMBH scaling relations consistent in slope and normalisation with those observed, and an $M_{\rm BH} - M_\star$ relation weakly evolving with redshift. The model also naturally generates SMBH accretion rates peaking within 1 Gyr of their host SFHs. We note that all the main predictions on galaxy quenched fractions and SMBH growth histories and scaling relations are degenerate with those expected in a halo quenching model. The comprehensive data-driven model presented in this work represents an invaluable tool to investigate SMBH demography across time and environments in an accurate, physically motivated manner, ideally suited to rapidly explore the implications from large surveys, such as Euclid and Rubin-LSST.

 - **Abstract**
 Direct detection of intercluster filaments is challenging due to their low surface density, resulting in a weak deflection field. We present weak-lensing detections of intercluster filaments using wide-field Dark Energy Camera (DECam) observations from the Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS). A matched-filter method was applied to identify filamentary structures in three nearby ($z < 0.1$) systems centered on Abell 401, Abell 2029, and Abell 3558. We discover two prominent filaments ($\geq 4\sigma$) in each system, with the strongest detections ($6.4\sigma - 7.3\sigma$) around Abell 401 and Abell 2029. In particular, we report the first robust weak-lensing detections $(>5 \sigma)$ of the intercluster bridges connecting the cluster pairs Abell 401/399, Abell 2029/2033, Abell 2029/SIG, and Abell 3558/3556. Adopting a filament convergence model motivated by numerical simulations, we infer the maximum convergence ($\kappa_0$) and characteristic width ($h_{\mathrm{c}}$) for all six filaments, yielding $\kappa_0 \sim 0.015 - 0.053$ and $h_{\mathrm{c}} \sim 0.11 - 0.45 \ \mathrm{Mpc}$. The performance of the matched-filter technique is validated using mock shear catalogs and further tested on a null field around Abell 2351. We also explore the potential of using the B-mode lensing signal of filaments to suppress cluster-induced shear contamination. These results demonstrate the feasibility of directly mapping dark matter filaments with current and future wide-field weak-lensing datasets.

#### A Star's Death by a Thousand Cuts: The Runaway Periodic Eruptions of AT2023uqm

 - **Abstract**
 Stars on bound orbits around a supermassive black hole may undergo repeated partial tidal disruption events (rpTDEs), producing periodic flares. While several candidates have been suggested, definitive confirmation of these events remains elusive. We report the discovery of AT2023uqm, a nuclear transient that has exhibited at least five periodic optical flares, making it only the second confirmed case of periodicity after ASASSN-14ko. Uniquely, the flares from AT2023uqm show a nearly exponential increase in energy--a "runaway" phenomenon signaling the star's progressive destruction. This behavior is consistent with rpTDEs of low-mass, main-sequence stars or evolved giant stars. Multiwavelength observations and spectroscopic analysis of the two most recent flares reinforce its interpretation as an rpTDE. Intriguingly, each flare displays a similar double-peaked structure, potentially originating from a double-peaked mass fallback rate or two discrete collisions per orbit. The extreme ratio of peak separation to orbital period draws attention to the possibility of a giant star being disrupted, which could be distinguished from a low-mass main-sequence star by its future mass-loss evolution. Our analysis demonstrates the power of rpTDEs to probe the properties of disrupted stars and the physical processes of tidal disruption, though it is currently limited by our knowledge of these events. AT2023uqm emerges as the most compelling rpTDE thus far, serving as a crucial framework for modeling and understanding these phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 In a tidal disruption event (TDE), a star is disrupted by the tidal field of a massive black hole, creating a debris stream that returns to the black hole, forms an accretion flow, and powers a luminous flare. Over the last few decades, several numerical studies have concluded that shock-induced dissipation occurs as the stream returns to pericentre (i.e., pre-self-intersection), resulting in efficient circularisation of the debris. However, the efficacy of these shocks is the subject of intense debate. We present high-resolution simulations (up to 10^10 particles) of the disruption of a solar-like star by a 10^6M_sun black hole with the new, GPU-based, smoothed-particle hydrodynamics code SPH-EXA, including the relativistic apsidal precession of the stellar debris orbits; our simulations run from initial disruption to the moment of stream self-intersection. With 10^8 particles - corresponding to the highest-resolution SPH simulations of TDEs in the pre-existing literature - we find significant, in-plane spreading of the debris as the stream returns through pericenter, in line with previous works that suggested this is a significant source of dissipation and luminous emission. However, with increasing resolution this effect is dramatically diminished, and with 10^10 particles there is effectively no change between the incoming and the outgoing stream widths. Our results demonstrate that the paradigm of significant dissipation of kinetic energy during pericentre passage is incorrect, and instead it is likely that debris circularisation is mediated by the originally proposed, stream-stream collision scenario.

#### Active Dwarf Galaxy Database II: Connections between Host Galaxy Properties and Black Hole Accretion Signatures

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the connection between accretion signatures and host galaxy properties in the context of how active dwarf galaxies are identified. We use the database constructed in Wasleske & Baldassare (2024) which contains dwarf galaxies that were selected as active galaxies by optical spectroscopy, infrared colors, X-ray brightness, and photometric variability. Multi-wavelength archival data was used to consistently apply all of these methods to every galaxy within this compiled set. The cross application of these methods resulted in a diversity of sub-populations identified as active by some set of these techniques. In this paper, we estimate host galaxy properties from spectral energy distribution models. We connect the active galactic nuclei (AGN) signatures to our estimated host galaxies' properties using statistical dimensionality reduction methods. We find that dwarf AGN selected by infrared colors are the most distinct population, with the highest star formation rates and lowest stellar masses. We also find some other key population differences, such as the broad line AGN having significantly higher AGN luminosities. X-ray and variability selected AGN have higher average star formation rates than those selected with optical narrow line spectroscopic diagrams. Our connections to the host galaxy parameters potentially point to the sub-populations representing different epochs of the evolution of accretion.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a multi-wavelength analysis of 14 tidal disruption events (TDEs)-including an off-nuclear event associated with an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy-selected for having available thermal X-ray spectra during their late-time UV/optical plateau phase. We show that at these stages, the full spectral energy distribution - X-ray spectra and UV/optical photometry - is well described by a compact, yet standard accretion disk, the same disk which powers the X-rays at all times. By fitting up to three three epochs per source with a fully relativistic disk model, we show that many system properties can be reliably recovered, including importantly the black hole mass ($M_{\bullet}$). These accretion-based $M_{\bullet}$ values, which in this sample span nearly three orders of magnitude, are consistent with galactic scaling relations but are significantly more precise (68\% credible interval $ < \pm 0.3$ dex) and physically motivated. Expected accretion scaling relations (e.g., $L_{Bol}^{ disk} / L_{Edd} \propto T_p^4 \propto M_{\bullet}^{-1}$), TDE-specific physics correlations ($L_{plat} \propto M_{\bullet}^{2/3}$ and $R_{out}/r_g \propto M_{\bullet}^{-2/3}$) and black hole-host galaxy correlations ($M_{\bullet}$-$M_{\star}$ and $M_{\bullet}$-$\sigma_{\star}$) naturally emerge from the data and, for the first time, are self-consistently extended into the intermediate-mass (IMBH, $M_{\bullet} < 10^{5}$) regime. We discuss the implications of these results for TDE physics and modeling. We also review and discuss different methods for $M_{\bullet}$ inference in TDEs, and find that approaches based on physical models of the early-time UV/optical emission are not able to recover (at a statistically significant level) black hole-host galaxy scalings.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of black hole mass within a cosmological background modeled by a Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG) under various dark energy equation of state parametrizations, including Linear, Logarithmic, CPL, JBP, FSLL-II, and Barboza--Alcaniz (BA) models. The logarithmic mass ratio $\log_{10}[M(z)/M_0]$ is found to be highly sensitive to the redshift-dependent evolution of $\omega(z)$, with gentle slopes in Linear, Logarithmic, and CPL models indicating quasi-static accretion, steep slopes in JBP corresponding to rapid late-time variations, and non-monotonic behaviour in FSLL-II and BA highlighting transient suppression or enhancement of accretion due to repulsive dark energy effects. Peaks, minima, and amplitude offsets in the mass ratio reflect the dynamic interplay between horizon thermodynamics, the evolving pressure of the MCG, and cosmic expansion, illustrating how the black hole mass growth is directly influenced by both the temporal evolution of dark energy and the effective gravitational potential of the surrounding cosmic fluid. Our results demonstrate that black hole accretion acts as a sensitive probe of the time-dependent cosmic pressure landscape and provides physical insights into the coupling between local strong gravity and global accelerated expansion.

#### Beyond general relativity: gravitational waves in non-minimally coupled theories

 - **Abstract**
 Non-minimal couplings between matter and curvature tensors arise in many different contexts. Such couplings modify solutions of general relativity (GR) and therefore can be probed in various astrophysical systems. A particularly interesting scenario arises if dark matter experiences non-minimal couplings, as dark matter densities are expected to spike in the vicinity of binary black hole mergers. This gives a novel setting for simultaneously studying dark matter and (beyond) GR physics via observations of gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we explore effects of various non-minimal couplings on GWs by working with a model-independent parameterization for left- and right-handed GW strains. We extend the parameterization proposed in \cite{Jenks:2023pmk,Daniel:2024lev} to include early-universe effects, and we write down the generic solution assuming slowly-varying matter fields. We then systematically apply our results to three models: Kalb-Ramond dark matter with dimension-four operators, axion-dilaton-Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet dimension-five operators, and dimension-six couplings to a (dark) vector field.

 - **Abstract**
 This work investigates a generalized holographic dark energy (HDE) model defined by a polynomial expansion in the Hubble parameter, incorporating the first three leading terms proportional to $H^{2}$, $H^{4}$, and $H^{6}$ through a variable parameter in the expression for the energy density. The analysis is developed within the framework of a spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Universe composed of non-interacting matter and this HDE fluid. We derive the complete set of Friedmann equations to study the cosmic evolution and subsequently examine the system for the existence of thermodynamic $P-V$ type phase transitions. Finally, a comprehensive comparison with the predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is presented.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze quasinormal modes, grey-body factors, and absorption cross-sections of a massive scalar field in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Hernquist dark-matter halo. The quasinormal spectrum is obtained through the higher-order WKB method and verified by time-domain evolution, showing consistent results. The field mass increases the oscillation frequency and reduces the damping rate, producing longer-lived modes, while variations in the halo parameters lead to moderate shifts in the spectrum. The grey-body factors reveal a suppression of low-frequency transmission and a displacement of their main features toward higher frequencies, resulting in a corresponding shift in the absorption cross-section.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study how the spin of particle modes influences particle creation, greybody factors, absorption, and evaporation of a black hole within the framework of modified electrodynamics in $f(R,T)$ gravity, recently proposed in Ref. [1]. All spin sectors -- scalar, vector, tensor, and spinorial -- are analyzed to obtain the corresponding features. For particle creation, we consider massless bosonic and fermionic perturbations to determine the respective particle densities. Analytical expressions for the greybody factors are derived, with suitable approximations for the tensor and spinorial cases. The absorption cross section is computed numerically, and using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we estimate the black hole evaporation lifetime. The associated energy and particle emission rates are also discussed, along with the correspondence between quasinormal modes and greybody factors.

 - **Abstract**
 The equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) have become the standard mathematical framework for modeling high-energy plasmas in curved spacetimes. However, the fragility of the primitive variable reconstruction operation in GRMHD, as well as the difficulties in maintaining strong hyperbolicity of the equations, sharply limit the applicability of the GRMHD model in scenarios involving large Lorentz factors and high magnetizations, such as around neutron stars. Non-ideal effects, such as electron inertia and Hall terms, are also neglected, and the absence of an explicitly evolved electric field precludes the self-consistent modeling of the strong poloidal fields found around spinning black holes, which are known to be crucial for jet formation. Here, we present a general relativistic multifluid model which strictly generalizes the GRMHD equations, consisting of an arbitrary number of relativistic fluid species interacting with a shared electromagnetic field via an explicit coupling of their source terms, thus allowing for the incorporation of non-ideal effects. We sketch how our model may be derived from general relativistic kinetics (via moments of the relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation), as well as how GRMHD may be recovered in the single-fluid limit as the mobility of charge carriers goes to infinity. We present a numerical scheme for solving the general relativistic multifluid equations, and validate it against the analogous scheme for the GRMHD equations. Since the primitive variable reconstruction operation for our multifluid model is purely hydrodynamic, and therefore independent of the magnetic field, the resulting solver is highly robust, and able to simulate significantly larger Lorentz factors and higher magnetizations (across both black hole and neutron star spacetimes) than GRMHD without loss of either accuracy or stability.

 - **Abstract**
 The thermodynamic properties of black holes have been extensively studied through analogies with classical systems, revealing fundamental connections between gravitation, entropy, and quantum mechanics. In this work, we extend the thermodynamic framework of black holes by incorporating charge and analyzing its role in entropy production. Using an analogy with charged rotating soap bubbles, we demonstrate that charge contributes to the total angular momentum and affects the entropy-event horizon relationship. By applying the Gouy-Stodola theorem, we establish a consistent thermodynamic formulation for charged black holes, showing that the first law of thermodynamics remains valid in this context. Furthermore, we explore the behavior of the partition function from the perspective of a distant observer, revealing that charge effects diminish with increasing distance. These findings reinforce the thermodynamic interpretation of black holes and provide insights into the interplay between charge, rotation, and entropy in gravitational systems.

 - **Abstract**
 In this note we introduce some concepts of Species Quantum Mechanics. Specifically, we consider quantum operators that correspond to the species number $N_s$ and the tower mass scale $m_t$ in the context of the swampland distance conjecture. We discuss the commutation relations, a possible wave function, and symplectic duality transformations on the conjugate variables. Furthermore, we argue that the Castellano-Ruiz-Valenzuela (CRV) pattern is a consequence of the canonical commutation rules of moduli space quantum mechanics. We also connect the canonical quantization to the periods of ${\cal N}=2$ Calabi-Yau compactifications to explore other aspects of the CRV pattern, including its possible connection to the Ooguri-Vafa-Verlinde black hole quantization procedure.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravity and gauge theory are concretely linked by the double copy. Although well-studied at the level of perturbative scattering in vacuum, far less is known about non-perturbative aspects or extensions of the double copy beyond trivial backgrounds. We show here how Hawking radiation in a collapse metric, its associated thermal spectrum, and horizon-dependence, emerges from the double copy of particle production in a background gauge field, where there is no global horizon, nor a thermal spectrum. Our approach combines worldline and amplitudes methods, and allows the unification of several classical and quantum double copy prescriptions for black hole spacetimes.

 - **Abstract**
 We describe an electromagnetic system which is related to black hole production with Hawking radiation through the double copy. We consider the scattering of a massless scalar particle through a collapsing electromagnetic background -- the single copy of Vaidya -- and identify the Feynman diagrams that exponentiate in the geometric-optics limit. The Bogoliubov coefficients obtained from the diagrammatic approach are reproduced by a semiclassical ray-tracing computation of null rays in this same background. We discuss the thermodynamic interpretation of the resulting number distribution in light of the double copy.

 - **Abstract**
 What happens at spacetime singularities is poorly understood. The Penrose-Wall singularity theorem constrains possible scenarios, but until recently its key assumption--the generalized second law (GSL)--had only been proven perturbatively, severely limiting this application. We highlight that recent progress enables a proof of the GSL in holographic brane-world models, valid non-perturbatively at the species scale $cG$ (with $c$ the number of matter fields and $G$ Newton's constant). This enables genuine constraints: an outer-trapped surface in the Einstein gravity regime implies geodesic incompleteness non-perturbatively at the species scale. Conversely, any genuine resolution must evade Penrose's criteria. We illustrate both possibilities with explicit examples: the classical BTZ black hole evolves to a more severe singularity, while a null singularity on the Rindler horizon is resolved, both by species-scale effects. Subject to the GSL, these constraints on singularity resolution apply beyond brane-worlds: namely, in any theory with a geometric UV scale--roughly, where the metric remains well-defined but classical Einstein gravity breaks down.

#### Double-soft limit and celestial shadow OPE from charge bracket

 - **Abstract**
 The dual formulations of an infinite tower of tree-level soft theorems in asymptotically flat spacetimes for scattering amplitudes in the standard energy-momentum basis and for correlators of a 2D celestial conformal field theory imply a correspondence between the celestial operator product expansion (OPE) and the higher spin charge bracket. We apply such correspondence to provide first a prescription to solve the double-soft limit ambiguity in the mixed-helicity sector of celestial OPEs. Furthermore, demanding the charge OPE/bracket correspondence to remain valid when operators are shadow transformed, we construct an algorithm to compute shadow celestial OPEs. We first test the algorithm by recovering results in the previous literature involving the celestial energy-momentum tensor; we then apply it to both gravity and Yang-Mills theory and generalize the OPE derivation to arbitrary spins.

#### Ladder Symmetries of Higher Dimensional Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 We compute the ladder operators for static tidal perturbations to higher-dimensional black holes. These operators map between solutions of the relevant equation of motion at different multipole orders. We focus on spin 0, 1 and 2 perturbations to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole and on spin 0 perturbations to the 5D Myers-Perry black hole. The ladder structure, used in conjunction with the existence of special ground state solutions, explains why the Love numbers of these higher-dimensional black holes vanish for specific combinations of the multipole moment and number of spacetime dimensions. This generalizes previous work on a ladder symmetry explanation for the vanishing of 4D black hole static Love numbers to higher dimensions.
