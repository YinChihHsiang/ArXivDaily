 - **Abstract**
 We present the first stellar stream discovered with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, around spiral galaxy M61 (NGC 4303) in Virgo First Look imaging. The stream is narrow, radially-oriented in projection, and ~50 kpc long. It has g-band surface brightness (SB) mu_g ~ 28 AB mag arcsec^-2, color g-z ~ 1.0, and stellar mass M_* ~ 2x10^8 M_Sun. This dwarf galaxy interaction may have provoked the M61 starburst, and foreshadows the bounty of accretion features expected in the ten-year Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate accretion disk winds commonly observed in galactic black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRB), which manifest as blueshifted absorption features in X-ray spectra. We model these winds as ideal magnetohydrodynamic outflows of hot plasma driven by global magnetic fields threading the accretion disk around the BH. Using Monte Carlo simulations with MONACO, we solve three-dimensional radiative transfer equations to determine the large-scale ionization structure that produces the observed ionic column densities. Focusing on the high/soft state of the BH XRB, where disk emission provides the dominant source of ionizing X-rays, we calculated synthetic spectra showing resonance absorption and scattered emission from ions in various charge states. Our results demonstrate that systems viewed at high polar angles exhibit prominent multi-ion absorption lines with asymmetric profiles, accompanied by P-Cygni-like emission features that partially reproduce the characteristics seen in the observed spectra. This further implies that even a dense disk wind with a high polar angle is unlikely to be saturated due to effective scattering.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data using predictions from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS). Specifically, we fit three two-point observables (3$\times$2pt), galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and cosmic shear, using the one-loop expressions for the projected angular correlation functions. We validate our pipeline against numerical simulations and we check for several internal consistencies before applying it to the observational data. Fixing the spectral tilt and the baryons abundance, we measure $S_8=0.833\pm 0.032$, $\Omega_m = 0.272\pm 0.022$, and $h = 0.773\pm 0.049$, to about $3.8\%$, $8.1\%$, and $6.3\%$, at $68\%$CL, respectively. While our results are consistent within $\lesssim 2\sigma$ with those from Planck and the BOSS full-shape analyses, they exhibit stronger tension with those from DES collaboration 3$\times$2pt analysis combined with a Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis prior, highlighting the impact of modeling, scale cuts, and choice of prior. The theory code and likelihood used for our analyses, \texttt{PyFowl}, is made publicly available.

 - **Abstract**
 GRS 1915$+$105 was the stellar-mass black hole that best reproduced key phenomena that are also observed in Type-1 active galactic nuclei. In recent years, however, it has evolved to resemble a Type-2 or Compton-thick AGN. Herein, we report on the first XRISM observation of GRS 1915$+$105. The high-resolution Resolve calorimeter spectrum reveals that a sub-Eddington central engine is covered by a layer of warm, Compton-thick gas. With the obscuration acting as a coronagraph, numerous strong, narrow emission lines from He-like and H-like charge states of Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni dominate the spectrum. Radiative recombination continuum (RRC) features are also observed, signaling that much of the emitting gas is photoionized. The line spectrum can be fit by three photoionized emission zones, with broadening and bulk velocities suggestive of an origin in the outer disk atmosphere and/or a slow wind at $r \simeq 10^{6}~GM/c^{2}$. The Fe XXV He-$\alpha$ and Fe XXVI Ly-$\alpha$ lines have a broad base that may indicate some emission from $r \sim 3\times 10^{3}~GM/c^{2}$. These results broadly support a picture wherein the current state in GRS 1915$+$105 is due to obscuration by the irradiated outer disk. This could arise through disk thickening if the Eddington fraction is higher than inferred, but it is more likely due to a warped, precessing disk that has brought the outer disk into the line of sight. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this interpretation and our modeling, and possible explanations of some potentially novel spectral features.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting gaseous debris disks around white dwarfs offers a unique window into the ultimate fate of planetary systems and the composition of accreted planetary material. Here we present a systematic search for such disks through the Ca II infrared triplet using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Early Data Release. From a parent sample of 2706 spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs, we identify 22 candidate systems showing tentative emission-line features, which corresponds to a raw occurrence rate of 0.81%, more than ten times higher than previous estimates. The detected emission lines are predominantly weak and require confirmation by follow-up observations. Three of these candidates also exhibit infrared excess in WISE photometry, suggesting a possible coexistence of gas and dust. However, the high candidate rate indicates that most are likely false positives due to telluric residuals or unresolved binaries. This work demonstrates the potential of DESI spectra for blind searches of rare circumstellar phenomena. The recently released DESI DR1, with its substantially larger spectroscopic sample, will enable searches for more gaseous disks and provide better insights into their occurrence and nature.

#### Multifaceted Accretion: The Interplay of Turbulence, Resistivity, Thermal Transport, and Dust around Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion near black holes (BHs) is multidimensional, with turbulence, resistivity, thermal transport, and dust dynamics all playing essential roles. In cold accretion discs (ADs) or the region of an AD where magnetic fields (MFs) are negligible (or absent), hydrodynamic (HD) turbulence is probably dominating. However, Magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is the primary cause of turbulence in ADs. Significant velocity variations and rapid pressure changes are characteristics of turbulent flows, which allow better mixing and more angular momentum (AM) and energy transfer. Also, in accretion flow (AF), the interaction between turbulence and resistivity determines the efficiency of energy dissipation and heat transfer. Radiation, convection, and thermal conduction (TC) are the heat transport modes existing in AFs, where TC enables energy transfer in accreting materials via heat flux. Moreover, convection, also generated by turbulence, significantly impacts the stability of the AD and its vertical structure. The disc may be affected by radiation from the AD surrounding the BH when X-ray emission occurs. The emission from the disc is also affected by dust particles. Dust grains near BH are exposed to high temperatures and intense radiation, which might affect the flow characteristics, as seen in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This chapter highlights the combined effect of turbulence, resistivity, transport mechanisms, and dust particles on BH AF. Future studies in this field must thoroughly investigate how dust, transport mechanisms, and turbulence interact in the BH accretion system.

#### Primordial black hole formation from the merger of oscillons

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25300

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25300

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the merger of oscillons results in a broad spectrum of the oscillon mass. A huge number of oscillon samples obtained from numerical lattice simulations reveal that the oscillon mass distribution has an exponential tail in a heavy-mass region. This enables us to infer the fractional abundance of heavy oscillons. Using the criterion for the primordial black hole (PBH) formation from the oscillon collapse obtained in previous studies, we estimate the abundance of PBHs and conclude that a sizable number of PBHs can be produced from oscillons. It can be an alternative PBH formation mechanism without employing the tuning of the inflaton potential to enhance the small-scale density fluctuations in the conventional PBH formation scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 The effective redshift distribution $n(z)$ of galaxies is a critical component in the study of weak gravitational lensing. Here, we introduce a new method for determining $n(z)$ for weak lensing surveys based on high-quality redshifts and neural network-based importance weights. Additionally, we present the first unified photometric redshift calibration of the three leading stage-III weak lensing surveys, the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey and the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), with state-of-the-art spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We verify our method using a new, data-driven approach and obtain $n(z)$ constraints with statistical uncertainties of order $\sigma_{\bar z} \sim 0.01$ and smaller. Our analysis is largely independent of previous photometric redshift calibrations and, thus, provides an important cross-check in light of recent cosmological tensions. Overall, we find excellent agreement with previously published results on the DES Y3 and HSC Y1 data sets while there are some differences on the mean redshift with respect to the previously published KiDS-1000 results. We attribute the latter to mismatches in photometric noise properties in the COSMOS field compared to the wider KiDS SOM-gold catalog. At the same time, the new $n(z)$ estimates for KiDS do not significantly change estimates of cosmic structure growth from cosmic shear. Finally, we discuss how our method can be applied to future weak lensing calibrations with DESI data.

#### Constraints on Cosmic Birefringence from SPIDER, Planck, and ACT observations

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25489

 - **Abstract**
 The Early Dark Energy (EDE) model has been proposed as a candidate mechanism to generate cosmic birefringence through a Chern-Simons coupling between a dynamical scalar field and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photon. Such birefringence induces a nonzero cross-correlation between the CMB $E$- and $B$-modes, providing a direct observational signature of parity violation. Recent measurements of the $EB$ and $TB$ power spectra, however, cannot yet unambiguously separate instrumental miscalibration ($\alpha$) from a true cosmic-rotation angle ($\beta$). For this reason, we perform a model-independent analysis in terms of the total effective rotation angle $\alpha+\beta$. We analyze the latest $EB$ and $TB$ measurements from the SPIDER, Planck, and ACT experiments and derive constraints on the Chern-Simons coupling constant $gM_{Pl}$ and on the polarization rotation angle $\alpha+\beta$. We find that the coupling $gM_{Pl}$ is not compatible with the SPIDER data, while it provides reasonable fits to the Planck and ACT measurements. The fits for $\alpha+\beta$ prefer a value larger than zero: when combined, Planck+ACT yield a detection significance of approximately 7$\sigma$. We also find that ACT data alone do not provide sufficiently tight constraints on either $gM_{Pl}$ or $\alpha+\beta$, whereas the combination Planck+ACT improves the statistical consistency of ACT's high-$\ell$ results and leads to a better PTE for those measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a fast method for obtaining fully analytical approximations for gravitational waveforms produced by merging of neutron stars and/or black holes for the earliest stages of the merger process. The obtained analytical formula is compared with numerical calculations, its accuracy and limits of applicability are evaluated. Our results may be useful not only for the earliest evalution of properties of the nature of binary system in gravitational-wave detectors but also will give early alerts for gamma-ray, optical and neutrino observatories.

#### Population of Binary Black Holes Inferred from One Hundred and Fifty Gravitational Wave Signals

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25579

 - **Abstract**
 The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations have reported gravitational wave signals from more than 150 binary black holes in the fourth catalog (GWTC-4). Here, we investigate the population properties of these binary black holes using the mixture-model framework Vamana. We present one-dimensional distributions of masses and spins, explore their correlations, and examine their evolution with redshift. These features may reflect astrophysical processes associated with binary black hole formation channels, although most remain poorly constrained. A notable feature is a peak near $10M_\odot$ in the primary mass and $8M_\odot$ in the chirp mass. Additionally, the primary and secondary masses correlate uniquely, producing pronounced peaks in the chirp mass around $14M_\odot$ and $27M_\odot$. The three peaks are roughly separated by a factor of two. A simple explanation for such well-placed peaks is a hierarchical merger scenario, in which the first peak arises from mergers of black holes of stellar origin, and higher-mass peaks arise from repeated mergers of black holes from lower-mass peaks. Although most binaries do not exhibit the high spins and characteristic mass ratios expected from hierarchical mergers, those that do are associated with the peaks observed in the chirp mass distribution.

#### Constraining baryonic feedback and cosmology from DES Y3 and Planck PR4 6$\times$2pt data. I. $Λ$CDM models

 - **Abstract**
 We combine weak lensing, galaxy clustering, cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing, and their cross-correlations (so-called 6$\times$2pt) to constrain cosmology and baryonic feedback scenarios using data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 Maglim catalog and the Planck satellite PR4 data release. We include all data points in the DES Y3 cosmic shear two-point correlation function (2PCF) down to 2.$^\prime$5 and model baryonic feedback processes via principal components (PCs) that are constructed from the ANTILLES simulations. We find a tight correlation between the amplitude of the first PC $Q_1$ and mean normalized baryon mass fraction $\bar{Y_\mathrm{b}}=\bar{f}_\mathrm{b}/(\Omega_\mathrm{b}/\Omega_\mathrm{m})$ from the ANTILLES simulations and employ an independent $\bar{Y_\mathrm{b}}$ measurement from Akino et al. (2022) as a prior of $Q_1$. We train a neural network $6\times2$pt emulator to boost the analysis speed by $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, which enables us to run an impressive number of simulated analyses to validate our analysis against various systematics. For our 6$\times$2pt analysis, we find $S_8=0.8073\pm0.0094$ when including a $Q_1$ prior from $\bar{Y_\mathrm{b}}$ observations. This level of cosmological constraining power allows us to put tight constraints on the strength of baryonic feedback. We find $Q_1=0.025^{+0.024}_{-0.029}$ for our 6$\times$2pt analysis and $Q_1=0.043\pm{0.016}$ when combining with external information from Planck, ACT, DESI. All these results indicate weak feedback, e.g., the tensions to Illustris ($Q_1=0.095$) and OWLS AGN T8.7 ($Q_1=0.137$) are 2.9$\sigma$-3.3$\sigma$ and 4.7$\sigma$-5.9$\sigma$, respectively.

#### Identification of Large-Scale (>100 kpc) Radio Jets in Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 Galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 Powerful, large-scale relativistic jets are usually associated with massive, old elliptical galaxies. This paradigm has recently been challenged by the identification of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies, thought to be young active galactic nuclei with low-mass black holes, harboring relativistic jets. Among them, sources hosting $>$100 kpc radio jets are extremely rare. Here, we report the discovery of large-scale, double-lobed radio structures in 33 NLSy1s with the projected linear size of at least 100 kpc from a recently published catalog of 22656 NLSy1 galaxies. These 33 include 29 confirmed double-lobed sources and 4 candidates whose radio structure requires further study. We suggest that their low black hole masses are unlikely to be due to their small angles of inclination to the line of sight. These enigmatic sources were identified by examining the radio observations taken with the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters, Very Large Array Sky Survey, Low Frequency Array, and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey. Among them, the NLSy1 source J1318+2626 ($z=0.62$) is found to host a radio jet with the projected linear size of 4.3 Mpc, making it the only NLSy1 galaxy hosting a Mpc-scale radio jet known as of today. We conclude that future observations of NLSy1 sources with the next generation of sensitive telescopes may reveal a much larger population harboring large-scale jets, thus providing crucial clues on their origin, propagation, and interaction with the ambient environment.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a simulation-based forward-modeling framework for cosmological inference from optical galaxy-cluster samples, and apply it to the abundance and weak-lensing signals of DES-Y1 redMaPPer clusters. The model embeds cosmology-dependent optical selection using a counts-in-cylinders approach, while also accounting for cluster miscentering and baryonic feedback in lensing. Applied to DES-Y1, and assuming a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we obtain $\Omega_m=0.254^{+0.026}_{-0.020}$ and $\sigma_8=0.826^{+0.030}_{-0.034}$, consistent with a broad suite of low-redshift structure measurements, including recent full-shape analyses, the DES/KiDS/HSC 3$\times$2 results, and most cluster-abundance studies. Our results are also consistent with \textit{Planck}, with the difference being significant at $2.58\sigma$. These results establish simulation-based forward-modeling of cluster abundances as a promising new tool for precision cosmology with Stage~IV survey data.

 - **Abstract**
 We present an investigation of quantum-corrected black hole spacetimes coupled with clouds of strings, examining two distinct theoretical models that incorporate quantum gravitational effects through different implementations of correction terms. Our study explores the geodesic structure, focusing on photon sphere properties, black hole shadows, and innermost stable circular orbits of test particles around these exotic geometries. The analysis reveals fundamental modifications to particle trajectories that distinguish quantum-corrected solutions from their classical counterparts, with observable implications for high-energy astrophysics. We investigate quasi-periodic oscillations arising from test particle motion, deriving frequency relationships that could serve as observational probes of quantum gravity effects in accreting black hole systems. Through rigorous gravitational lensing analysis using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we calculate weak-field deflection angles and identify distinctive signatures that enable discrimination between the two quantum correction models. The gravitational lensing study reveals opposite dependencies on quantum parameters between the models, providing unambiguous observational discriminants. Additionally, we analyze the thermodynamic properties including temperature, entropy, and heat capacity modifications, exploring topological characteristics and phase transition behavior in these quantum-corrected systems. The investigation reveals that the two models exhibit contrasting behaviors across multiple observational channels, from gravitational lensing deflection angles to quasi-periodic oscillation frequencies, providing remarkable discriminants for testing quantum gravity theories.

#### Observable signature of magnetic tidal coupling in hierarchical triple systems

 - **Abstract**
 We study hierarchical triple systems formed by a compact binary orbiting a supermassive black hole (SMBH), focusing on the role of relativistic magnetic tidal interactions. Extending previous analyses of precession resonances to 0.5 post-Newtonian order, we incorporate quadrupolar magnetic tidal moments, which have no Newtonian counterpart. Averaging the Hamiltonian over the inner orbit, we find that magnetic tides introduce new resonances absent at lower order, leading to additional eccentricity excitations and significantly modifying the binary's long-term evolution. Numerical solutions of the Lagrange Planetary Equations confirm these analytical predictions and reveal how resonance strength depends on orbital eccentricity and inclination. The resulting dynamics accelerates the binary merger and imprint distinctive signatures on gravitational waves, potentially observable by LISA. Our findings identify magnetic tidal coupling as a novel strong-gravity effect and establish its importance for the resonant dynamics of compact-object binaries near SMBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 Periodic orbits exhibiting zoom-whirl behavior have become attractive topics for studying particle dynamics and gravitational wave emission in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). This study systematically investigates periodic orbits around black holes and their gravitational wave radiation in three dark matter halo environments: NFW, Beta, and Moore models. The dark matter distribution in these models can be effectively incorporated using two parameters -- the dark matter characteristic mass and halo characteristic radius. Our results reveal that for a larger dark matter mass and a smaller characteristic radius, the shapes of the periodic orbits and the corresponding gravitational waveforms show more significant deviations from the Schwarzschild case. As the halo characteristic radius increases, the orbital shapes and waveform characteristics gradually converge with the Schwarzschild black hole results. For the different dark matter halo models, the NFW and Beta models produce nearly indistinguishable results, while the Moore model shows distinctly different effects. These findings enhance our understanding of dark matter halo effects on gravitational wave signatures and may provide constraints for future space-based detectors.

#### BOB the (Waveform) Builder: Optimizing Analytical Black-Hole Binary Merger Waveforms

 - **Abstract**
 The Backwards-One-Body (BOB) model provides a fully analytical and physically motivated description of the merger-ringdown gravitational radiation emanating from a black hole binary merger. We perform a comprehensive validation of BOB for the dominant $(2,2)$ mode of quasi-circular and non-precessing systems, assessing its accuracy against numerical relativity (NR) simulations, state-of-the-art waveform models, and a sum of quasinormal modes. We demonstrate that BOB most accurately describes the gravitational wave news, achieving accuracy comparable to highly-calibrated Effective-One-Body and NR surrogate models. Because BOB is minimally tuned to NR catalogs, it retains a high level of accuracy in regions of the parameter space sparsely covered by current NR catalogs. BOB yields an analytic link between the amplitude of the fundamental quasinormal mode and the peak amplitude of the News, which we verify to within the errors of a surrogate ringdown model. We identify a flavor of BOB that requires only the remnant mass and spin, yet matches the accuracy of models that fit a sum of many overtones. Lastly, we show that BOB accurately models both the mass and current quadrupole waves for superkick configurations, contrary to a claim in the literature, and explain why that study was not actually implementing BOB as it has been defined. Our findings establish BOB as a powerful tool for gravitational wave analysis, for providing independent tests of NR-calibrated models, and for better understanding the underlying physics of the merger. We provide a companion python package, gwBOB, allowing for the easy construction of various flavors of BOB and comparison to NR waveforms.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the possible characterization of ringdown waves in a dynamical Vaidya spacetime using the Penrose limit geometry around the dynamical photon sphere. In the case of a static spherically symmetric black hole spacetime, it is known that the quasinormal frequency in the eikonal limit can be characterized by the angular velocity and the Lyapunov exponent for the null geodesic congruence on the orbit of the unstable circular null geodesic. This correspondence can be further backed up by the analysis of the Penrose limit geometry around the unstable circular null geodesic orbit. We try to extend this analysis to a Vaidya spacetime, focusing on the dynamical photon sphere in it. Then we discuss to what extent the Penrose limit geometry can be relevant to the ringdown waves in the Vaidya spacetime, comparing the results with the numerically calculated waveform in the Vaidya spacetime.

 - **Abstract**
 The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) from eccentric stellar-mass binary black holes (SBBHs) holds crucial clues to their origins. For the first time, we employ a Bayesian framework to assess the detectability and distinguishing features of such an SGWB with spaceborne detectors, while accounting for contamination from the Galactic foreground. Our analysis covers eccentric SBBHs from three formation channels: isolated binary evolution, dynamical assembly in globular clusters (GCs), and in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We find that TianQin, LISA, and Taiji can detect the SGWBs from both isolated and GC-formed SBBHs after 4 years of operation, with the corresponding signal-to-noise ratios of around 10, 60, and 170. However, these backgrounds are spectrally degenerate with a strictly power-law SGWB. Furthermore, highly eccentric SBBHs formed in AGNs yield an SGWB marked by a spectral turnover and sharp decline. While this feature lowers the signal-to-noise ratio by approximately an order of magnitude, it can enable a clear distinction from the strictly power-law background using LISA and Taiji.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute asymptotic Quasi-Normal Mode (QNM) frequencies -- i.e. frequencies with a very large Imaginary part -- of a Loop Quantum Gravity inspired Black Hole. The deformations from the Schwarzschild Black Hole are encoded via two parameters: the minimal area gap $a_0$ and the polymeric deformation parameter $P$. In this study, we focus on the effect of the latter one, $P$, on the highly-damped part of QNM spectra. We consider both spin 0 and spin 2 test-field perturbations on the Black Hole as proper gravitational perturbations cannot be performed on an effective model. We use an analytical method of computation of QNMs referred to as the monodromy technique, which allows us to compute the asymptotic behaviour of QNMs. We found interesting oscillating behaviour in both the Real part and the Imaginary part of the QNMs, where the oscillation period varies with the polymeric deformation parameter $P$. We compare these analytical predictions to numerical results obtained thanks to the Continued fraction method. Even though the latter does not converge for QNMs with a very large Imaginary part, the numerical results are in rather good agreement with the monodromy prediction.

 - **Abstract**
 Long-term numerical relativity (NR) simulations of binary black hole (BBH) systems in the Spectral Einstein Code (SpEC) code exhibit an unexpected exponential drift of the center-of-mass (CoM) away from the simulation's origin. In our work, we analyze this phenomenon and demonstrate that it is not a physical effect but rather a manifestation of a gauge artifact. The origin of this drift is the reflection of the gauge waves off the outer boundary of the computational domain. These reflections are introduced by inaccuracies in the gauge boundary condition, specifically, the application of the Sommerfeld condition to the time derivative of the gauge fields. Such an approach fails to completely suppress or correctly absorb the outgoing modes, thereby generating artificial feedback into the simulation. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a modified boundary condition that incorporates an explicit CoM correction source term designed to counteract the CoM motion. Our numerical experiments, performed with the SpEC code, reveal that this new boundary treatment reduces the CoM drift by several orders of magnitude compared to the standard implementation, and does not introduce any unwanted physical artifacts.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we utilize the ray-tracing method to conduct an in-depth study of the observational images of asymmetric thin-shell wormholes in the Kalb-Ramond field. Initially, we calculate the null geodesics and effective potential energy of ATSW, and investigate the variations in the photon sphere radius and critical impact parameter under different values of charge Q and Lorentz-violating parameter l. Based on these calculations, we determine the photon deflection angles and trajectories within this space-time structure. Specifically, depending on the photon impact parameters, the photon trajectories can be categorized into three types. By using a thin accretion disk as the sole background light source and incorporating two classical observational radiation models, we find that under conditions of equal mass M, charge quantity Q, and Lorentz-violation parameter l, the asymmetric thin-shell wormhole exhibits unique observational features such as additional lensing rings and photon ring clusters. Furthermore, distinct from black holes, as the charge quantity Q and the Lorentz-violation parameter l increase, the coverage area of the specific additional halo also expands correspondingly.

 - **Abstract**
 Solutions to the Einstein equations near the threshold of black hole formation exhibit remarkable behavior known as critical phenomena gravitational collapse. In this work we perform characteristic evolution in compactified Bondi coordinates in order to study the critical collapse of a Yang-Mills field, allowing for the extraction of global quantities such as the Bondi mass and news function. Our numerical approach is fourth-order accurate. First, we demonstrate that the collapsing field exhibits local DSS behavior, characterized by an echoing period of~$\Delta \simeq 0.7388$, agreeing with previous works up to the second decimal place. We find that global quantities such as the Bondi mass and news function display the same DSS behavior. We furthermore show that the mass of the black holes formed during near-threshold evolutions scales as a function of the distance to the critical parameter, with a critical exponent of approximately~$\gamma=0.1977\pm0.0009$. Finally, our findings indicate that these results are universal, irrespective of the initial data.

#### Parameter matching between horizon quasi-local and point-particle definitions at 1PN for quasi-circular and non spinning BBH systems in harmonic gauge

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how commonly used parameter definitions in Post-Newtonian (PN) theory compare with those from Numerical Relativity (NR) for binary black hole (BBH) systems. In NR, masses and spins of each companion are measured quasi-locally from apparent horizon geometry, whereas in PN they are attributes of point particles defined via asymptotic matching in body zones. Although these definitions coincide in the infinite-separation limit, they could differ by finite-separation corrections that matter for precision modeling. Working entirely in harmonic gauge, we perform asymptotic matching between each companion's inner zone metric -- obtained from black hole perturbation theory -- and the PN two-body metric, and construct the coordinate transformation that preserves the gauge in the strong field region. We solve perturbatively for the apparent horizon (AH) on a group of harmonic inertial time slice and compute its quasi-local areal mass from the horizon geometry. Then we establish the leading order matching between quasi-local (AH based) and PN (point-particle) parameter definitions in harmonic gauge. We find that on a horizon penetrating harmonic slicing, the AH quasi-local mass agrees with the PN point-particle mass at 1PN order. For generic harmonic slicings that deviate from the horizon penetrating condition by a 1PN order perturbation, the AH mass differs from the PN mass also by a 1PN correction. This parameter matching is crucial for hybridizing PN and NR waveforms and for providing better initial conditions in NR and Cauchy-Characteristic Evolution (CCE) simulations. The framework provides a bridge between different descriptions of BBH systems, and it can be extended to spinning and eccentric cases and more general NR gauges.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we consider the Euclidean partition function of charged and uncharged AdS black hole geometries in (d+1)-dimensions. It is seen that the partition function can be reduced to a one-dimensional integral, which can be investigated using methods of Picard-Lefschetz. The saddles of the system correspond to either naked-singular geometry, thermal-AdS, small-, intermediate- or large-sized black hole for different ranges of parameter space. These are solutions of Einstein's equation, which are dominant saddles in the partition function in various regimes of parameter space. A naive analysis of the partition function involving these saddles would lead to conflicts with the standard understanding of black hole thermodynamics and also with AdS/CFT. However, when the partition function is analysed using Picard-Lefschetz, it is seen that naked-singular geometries don't contribute. The saddles corresponding to them are irrelevant, aligning well with the Cosmic Censorship hypothesis. Saddles corresponding to negative specific heat are either small- or intermediate-sized black holes. Although they are relevant in the partition function but are sub-dominant. They also drop out under homology averaging. Saddles corresponding to only non-negative specific heat contribute to the Euclidean partition function. Finally, we analyze the allowability of these complex geometries using the KSW criterion.

 - **Abstract**
 For three-dimensional Kerr-de Sitter space-time, we find the singular energy-momentum and spin tensor sources that generate the non-trivial geometry. The energy-momentum tensor is symmetric, conserved and compatible with a spinning massive point particle whose mass and angular velocity we determine. The calculation is based on the analysis of the holonomy for a closed loop around the singularity of the $SO(1,3)$ Chern-Simons gauge field appropriate for gravity in the presence of a positive cosmological constant. This holonomy is related, via the non-abelian Stokes theorem, to the singular source terms at the center. Our results may be helpful for a better understanding of the algebra of observables of a local observer in the Kerr-de Sitter space-time.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct generalized sets of asymptotic conditions for both three-dimensional Maxwell Chern-Simons gravity and a novel extension that incorporates torsion through a deformation of the Maxwell algebra. These boundary conditions include the most general temporal components of the gauge fields that consistently preserve the corresponding asymptotic Maxwell algebras with identical classical central charges, while allowing for the inclusion of chemical potentials conjugate to the conserved charges. We show that both sets of asymptotic configurations admit nontrivial solutions carrying not only mass and angular momentum but also an additional global spin-2 charge. In the torsionless case, the theory admits locally flat cosmological spacetimes, whereas in the presence of torsion, it generalizes to BTZ-like black hole geometries. For each case, the thermodynamic properties are consistently derived in terms of the gauge fields and the topology of the Euclidean manifold, shown to correspond to a solid torus. Furthermore, we obtain a general expression for the entropy, depending on both the horizon area and its spin-2 analogues, which can be written as a reparametrization-invariant integral of the induced spin-2 fields on the spacelike section of the horizon.

 - **Abstract**
 We classify and construct supersymmetric solutions of D=3, N=2 gauged supergravity extended with a Fayet-Iliopoulos term, and null, timelike, and warped AdS spacetimes are among them. From the first one, it is possible to obtain a well-defined black hole by periodic identification. We also find charged string solutions that interpolate between two supersymmetric AdS or Minkowski extrema of the scalar potential, one of which corresponds to a horizon with a singularity behind it, and the other determines the asymptotic geometry.
