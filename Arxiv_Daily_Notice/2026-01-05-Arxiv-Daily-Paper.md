#### The propagation of long GRB jets through and beyond its progenitor star

 - **Abstract**
 Long gamma-ray bursts (lGRB) are produced by relativistic jets arising from the collapse of massive stars. Such progenitor environments present complex physical conditions that are challenging to model by numerical simulations. The difficulty increases when solving the accretion process and propagation of the outflows, as it requires covering distances from the black hole horizon to beyond the progenitor star. General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations provide a convenient framework to study high-luminosity jets, where magnetic flux plays an important role in the process of jet launching from the central engine. To follow the propagation of the jet through and beyond its progenitor environment, we use multi-scale simulations (i.e., AMR-based). In this work, we report results of 2.5-dimensional GRMHD simulations of a lGRB progenitor. We present highly magnetized, weakly magnetized, and non-magnetized pre-collapse stars, and discuss the observational implications for lGRB jets.

 - **Abstract**
 Since the launch of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in late 2021, our understanding of high-redshift objects has faced several upheavals. JWST has discovered much more massive galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBH) than cosmological models had expected. Furthermore, JWST observations have revealed an entirely novel population of high-redshift objects. Characterized by a dominant red rest-frame component and point-like morphology, these ``little red dots'' (LRD) have set off a flurry of observational and theoretical follow-up. The current identity of LRD is highly debated, yet falling into two main scenarios: active galactic nuclei (i.e., SMBH) or compact star-forming regions. If star-forming, LRD would represent the highest stellar densities ever observed. If SMBH, their high Eddington fractions, and already high masses, help elucidate the growth of the most massive SMBH found by JWST in the early Universe ($z \gtrsim4)$. In this mini-review, we present the observational evidence accumulated to date, including sub-millimeter probes of LRD dust masses, constraints on radio and X-ray emission from stacking, and rest-frame ultraviolet \& optical measurements provided by JWST. Furthermore, we highlight how identifying additional LRD that are truly primarily SMBH-driven may help to shed light on the formation of `overly massive' SMBH discovered by JWST within the first billion years since the Big Bang.

#### Measurement of the extragalactic background light at 8600Å using dark cloud shadow and the CaII-triplet lines

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of a measurement of the near infrared Extragalactic Background Light using the dark-cloud method. Long-slit spectra covering the opaque core of the intermediate--latitude globule DC303.8-14.2 and the almost unobscured off area were measured using nodding-along-the-slit measuring technique providing a differential spectrum free of most of the foreground components. A template for the only remaining major foreground component, the scattered integrated starlight dominated by the strong Ca II triplet lines at 8498, 8542, 8664$Å$, from the dark core itself was constructed using the GAIA RVS spectral database. The derived EBL intensity is $1.62\pm 0.76(\sigma_{stat})\, 10^{-9} erg\, cm^{-2} s^{-1}Å^{-1} sr^{-1}$ or $13.8\pm6.5(\sigma_{stat})$nW m$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$; this represents a tentative detection at $2.1\sigma$, level.

 - **Abstract**
 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images of the supermassive black hole M87* depict an asymmetric ring of emission. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) models of M87* and its accretion disk predict that the amplitude and location of the ring's peak brightness asymmetry should fluctuate due to turbulence in the source plasma. We compare the observed distribution of brightness asymmetry amplitudes to the simulated distribution in GRMHD models, across varying black hole spin $a_{*}$. We show that, for strongly magnetized (MAD) models, three epochs of EHT data marginally disfavor $|a_{*}| \lesssim 0.2$. This is consistent with the Blandford-Znajek model for M87's jet, which predicts that M87* should have nonzero spin. We show quantitatively how future observations could improve spin constraints, and discuss how improved spin constraints could distinguish between differing jet-launching mechanisms and black hole growth scenarios.

#### Constraining Primordial Black Holes via p-wave annihilation in light of CMB Spectral Distortion and 21-cm global signal
 - **Authors:** Shibsankar Si, Pravin Kumar Natwariya, Alekha C. Nayak

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00413

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) can form spike density halos through the accretion of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). In these halos, the enhanced density significantly boosts the annihilation rate of WIMPs. For Majorana dark matter annihilation into light fermions, the s-wave part of the annihilation cross section is helicity-suppressed, making the p-wave contribution dominant. We study the velocity-dependent p-wave annihilation case, whose resulting energy injection can modify the thermal and ionization history of the Universe, leaving observable imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum and the global 21-cm signal. From the predicted energy injection into the plasma, we derive stringent upper limits on the fraction of dark matter in form of PBHs for p-wave annihilation models, based on the observational constraints of the CMB spectral distortions ($y$-type), and from the measurement of the 21-cm absorption signal at cosmic dawn. Our results highlight that accounting for the p-wave nature of annihilation is crucial for deriving robust constraints on the PBH abundance.

#### Late-Time Resolution of the Hubble Tension in CPL Cosmology with Massive Neutrinos via Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00495

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the Hubble constant within the framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), focusing on the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and its dynamical dark energy extensions described by the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, both with and without massive neutrinos. By embedding the cosmological background equations directly into a Bayesian PINN architecture, we reconstruct the Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ in a data-driven yet physically consistent manner, while rigorously propagating epistemic uncertainties. Our analysis combines late-time observational probes, including Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO DESI DR2), and the Pantheon supernova sample, and quantifies the resulting tension in the inferred Hubble constant with respect to Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background constraints and the SH0ES (R22) local distance ladder measurement. Within $\Lambda$CDM, we find that data combinations involving BAO tend to favor lower values of $H_0$, alleviating the tension with Planck at the expense of increased disagreement with SH0ES. Allowing for a time-evolving dark energy equation of state in the CPL framework systematically shifts the posterior of $H_0$ toward higher values, leading to a notable reduction of the SH0ES tension, particularly for combinations including supernova data. The most flexible scenario, CPL with a free total neutrino mass $\Sigma m_\nu$, yields a balanced reconciliation between early- and late-Universe determinations of $H_0$, with tension levels typically reduced to the $\sim1$-$2\sigma$ range relative to both Planck and SH0ES. Our results highlight the nontrivial interplay between dark energy dynamics and neutrino mass in addressing the Hubble tension and demonstrate the efficacy of Bayesian PINNs as a robust and versatile tool for precision cosmology beyond the standard paradigm.

#### High-energy Emission from Turbulent Electron-ion Coronae of Accreting Black Holes

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00518

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00518

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a model of particle energization and emission from strongly turbulent black-hole coronae. Our local model is based on a set of 2D radiative particle-in-cell simulations with an electron-ion plasma composition, injection and diffusive escape of photons and charged particles, and self-consistent Compton scattering. We show that a radiatively compact turbulent corona generates extended nonthermal ion distributions, while producing X-ray spectra consistent with observations. As an example, we demonstrate excellent agreement with observed X-ray spectra of NGC 4151. The predicted emission spectra feature an MeV tail, which can be studied with future MeV-band instruments. The MeV tail is shaped by nonthermal electrons accelerated at turbulent current sheets. We also find that the corona regulates itself into a two-temperature state, with ions much hotter than electrons. The ions carry away roughly 60% to 70% of the dissipated power, and their energization is driven by a combination of shocks and reconnecting current sheets, embedded into the turbulent flow.

#### A New Empirical Fit to Galaxy Rotation Curves

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00522

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new empirical model for galaxy rotation curves that introduces a velocity correction term {\omega}, derived from observed stellar motion and anchored to Keplerian baselines. Unlike parametric halo models or modified gravity theories, this approach does not alter Newtonian dynamics or invoke dark matter distributions. Instead, it identifies a repeatable kinematic offset that aligns with observed rotation profiles across a wide range of galaxies. Using SPARC data [1], we demonstrate that this model consistently achieves high fidelity fits, often outperforming MOND and CDM halo models in RMSE and R-squared metrics without parametric tuning. The method is reproducible, minimally dependent on mass modeling, and offers a streamlined alternative for characterizing galactic dynamics. While the velocity correction {\omega} lacks a definitive physical interpretation, its empirical success invites further exploration. We position this model as a local kinematic tool rather than a cosmological framework, and we welcome dialogue on its implications for galactic structure and gravitational theory. Appendix B presents RMSE and R2 comparisons showing that this method consistently outperforms MOND and CDM halo models across a representative galaxy sample.

#### Eccentric Disks from Circumbinary Rings

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00741

 - **Abstract**
 We perform high-resolution, grid-based hydrodynamics simulations of finite gaseous circumbinary rings (CBRs) viscously spreading into disks around binaries. We find that all systems suppress accretion onto the binary when the gas is relatively cold. CBRs display weak variability above the binary orbital frequency $\Omega_b$ and a dominant, robust spectral peak at $\sim0.1\Omega_b$ (half the fiducial lump frequency of $\sim0.2\Omega_b$). Smaller rings relax into disks with enhanced gas eccentricity up to $e\simeq 0.3$. We consider the possibility that inefficiently-accreting, intermediate-mass ($\sim10^4 M_\odot$) black hole binaries may be sources of quasi-periodic eruptions when rejected streams shock the cavity wall and radiate in the UV or soft X-ray. We discuss the implications of eccentric disks evolved from CBRs for quasar light curves and asymmetric, time-variable double-peaked line emission from disks in galactic nuclei. If binaries drive asymmetry in accretion disk line profiles, our study suggests that the progenitor CBR must have been very compact.

 - **Abstract**
 The nature of dark energy (DE) remains elusive, even though it constitutes the dominant energy-density component of the Universe and drives the late-time acceleration of cosmic expansion. By combining measurements of the expansion history from baryon acoustic oscillations, supernova surveys, and cosmic microwave background data, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Collaboration has inferred that the DE equation of state may evolve over time. The profound implications of a time-variable, ``dynamical" DE (DDE) that departs from a cosmological constant motivate the need for independent observational tests. In this work, we use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation to investigate how DDE affects the properties of the Lyman-Alpha ``forest'' of absorption features produced by neutral hydrogen in the cosmic web. We find that DDE models consistent with the DESI constraints induce a spectral tilt in the forest transmitted flux power spectrum, imprinting a scale- and redshift-dependent signature relative to standard Lambda-CDM cosmologies. These models also yield higher intergalactic medium temperatures and reduced Lyman-Alpha opacity compared to Lambda-CDM. We discuss the observational implications of these trends as potential avenues for independent confirmation of DDE.

#### From Rotating Attractors to Extremal Black Holes with Axionic Hair

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00066

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00066

 - **Abstract**
 We study extremal, rotating black holes in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-axion (EMA) theory through a combined near-horizon and bulk analysis. At the level of the near-horizon extremal geometry (NHEG), using the entropy function formalism, we prove that regular rotating attractors with axionic hair exist only for configurations that are purely electrically or purely magnetically charged; regular rotating dyonic attractors are excluded by the axion equation of motion, a result that we established perturbatively and non-perturbatively within the NHEG system. On the global side, we construct families of asymptotically flat, rotating extremal EMA black holes that interpolate to the electric NHEG branch, confirming that horizon data are fixed by extremization of the entropy function and decoupled from asymptotic moduli in line with the attractor mechanism.

#### Gravitation and Spacetime: Emergent from Spinor Interactions -- How?

 - **Abstract**
 Newtonian gravity arises as the nonrelativistic, static, weak-field limit of some Lorentzian spacetime geometry solving the generally covariant Einstein equations for a given matter field configuration. Spacetime geometry has a local description in the spinor basis of Penrose. The breakdown of relativistic quantum (field) theory at small distances suggests that, the Lorentzian geometry is to be modified below some regularization length. The thermodynamic correspondence, e.g. for black holes or other horizons, indicates that, Lorentzian spacetime is an emergent geometric description of an ensemble of more fundamental constituents. The independent derivations of the area law of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by string theory and loop quantum gravity show that, (some) properties of spacetime do not depend on the nature of its fundamental constituents (in leading order). Whether, on a fundamental scale, spacetime gravity has its own classical or quantum constituents (like e.g. in loop quantum gravity), or it is just an effective theory, deriving from expectation values of quantum matter operators (like in spinor gravity or causal fermion systems), this is still open. We compare some very different classical and quantum approaches to spacetime geometry, all deriving in one way or another from spinors, and comment on questions for future research in order to clarify their relations. We propose that both, the causal structure and the spin networks for generation of discrete geometry arise via projection from all particle spinors (fermionic and bosonic) within a causal double cone region and their spin interwining interaction events onto a spatial section of this double cone region.

#### Metric Reconstruction and Second Order Perturbation for Generic Spherically Symmetric spacetime

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00162

 - **Abstract**
 Higher-order perturbations during the ringdown phase are essential for testing gravitational theories. This requires a perturbation framework that extends beyond General Relativity, as well as an appropriate method for reconstructing the spacetime metric. In this work, we address these challenges within the context of general spherically symmetric spacetimes. We introduce a modified Teukolsky equation for perturbative calculations in asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric spacetimes. The metric reconstruction method, which does not rely on the Hertz potential, is extended to $tr$-symmetric spacetime, allowing for the calculation of metric components under specific gauge conditions. Additionally, we present a second-order perturbation theory applicable to generic spherically symmetric spacetimes.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave astronomy plays a pivotal role in testing the dynamics of gravity in strong-field regimes and probing the nature of black holes. Motivated by recent studies on late-time tails in gravitational waves, we examine the gravitational wave tails of black holes incorporating quantum corrections within the framework of effective Loop Quantum Gravity. Our findings indicate that both the amplitudes and the intermediate behavior of these tails are influenced by quantum corrections. We demonstrate that the amplitude and transient characteristics of the tail are sensitive to the specific details of the black hole's dynamics.

#### Imprints of quantum gravity effects on gravitational waves: a comparative study using extreme mass-ratio inspirals

 - **Abstract**
 Within a generally covariant Hamiltonian framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG), two black hole models parameterized by a quantum correction $\zeta$ have recently been constructed. Using extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) as high-precision probes, we investigate the imprints of this LQG deformation in the surrounding spacetime. Waveforms generated via an improved augmented analytic kludge (AAK) model in both LQG-BH backgrounds and in Schwarzschild spacetime are compared through a faithfulness analysis. This allows us to quantify the detectability of the deviation with LISA and to derive constraints on $\zeta$ based on a detection threshold. We find that the first LQG-BH model produces significantly stronger signatures in EMRI signals than the second, making its quantum gravity effects more accessible to future space-borne gravitational-wave detection.

#### Taxonomy of periodic orbits and gravitational waves in a deformed Schwarzschild black hole spacetime

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate periodic orbits of test particles around a deformed Schwarzschild black hole and the resulting gravitational waves. Firstly, we examine the properties of circular orbits and find that circular orbits could disappear when the deformation is large enough. Then, using an orbital taxonomy, we characterize various periodic orbits with a set of triples, which describes the zoom-whirl behaviours. We also calculate the gravitational waveform signals generated by different periodic orbits, revealing the influence of the deformation on the gravitational wave, which can be potentially picked up by future space-based detectors.

#### Interacting Ghost Dark Energy with Sign-Changeable Coupling in Brans-Dicke Cosmology

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00582

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we analyze the ghost dark energy model in Brans-Dicke cosmology in the framework of a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe. We consider an interaction between ghost dark energy and dark matter with a sign-changeable interaction term. To discuss the cosmological implications of the model, we consider a well-motivated logarithmic form of the Brans-Dicke scalar field. By deriving the cosmological evolution equations, we obtain the cosmological parameters such as the equation of state and deceleration parameters. We analyze the behavior of the cosmological parameters by plotting their graphs against the redshift parameter ($z$). We observe that the equation of state parameter shows quintessence-like behaviour during present and future epochs; however, phantom-like behavior is also possible for suitable values of the model parameters. Analysis of the deceleration parameter shows a smooth recent phase transition of the universe (deceleration to acceleration). An interesting result we observe is the decelerated expansion of the universe in the far future, i.e, the universe experiences another phase transition in the future. The physical significance of the well-known cosmological plane ($w_D-w_D'$ plane) is discussed in our model. We observe that the trajectories start in the freezing region with the same initial behavior, deviate from each other during the evolution and ends in the thawing region. Finally, we perform a detailed thermodynamic analysis and demonstrate that the generalized second law of thermodynamics is satisfied within the present interacting ghost dark energy model.

#### Exceptional Lines and Excitation of (Nearly) Double-Pole Quasinormal Modes: A Semi-Analytic Study in the Nariai Black Hole

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.00704

 - **Abstract**
 We show that quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a massive scalar field in Kerr-de Sitter and Myers-Perry black holes exhibit an exceptional line (EL), which is a continuous set of exceptional points (EPs) in parameter space, at which two QNM frequencies and their associated solutions coincide. We find that the EL appears in the parameter space spanned by the scalar mass and the black hole spin parameter, and also in the Nariai limit, i.e., $r_{\rm c} - r_{\rm h} \to 0$, where $r_{\rm c}$ and $r_{\rm h}$ denote the radii of the cosmological and black hole horizons, respectively. We analytically study the amplitudes or excitation factors of QNMs near the EL. Such an analytic treatment becomes possible since, in the Nariai limit, the perturbation equation reduces to a wave equation with the Pöschl-Teller (PT) potential. We discuss the destructive excitation of QNMs and the stability of the ringdown near and at the EL. The transient linear growth of QNMs -- a characteristic excitation pattern near an EP or EL -- together with the conditions under which this linear growth dominates the early ringdown, is also studied analytically. Our conditions apply to a broad class of systems that involve the excitation of (nearly) double-pole QNMs.

#### Extremalization approach to black hole thermodynamics: perturbations around higher-derivative gravities

 - **Abstract**
 When higher-derivative terms are added to a gravitational action, black hole solutions and their thermodynamic properties are generally corrected. Recent progress has shown that, by treating higher-derivative operators as perturbations, the first-order corrections to black hole thermodynamics can be obtained without explicit knowledge of the corresponding perturbed black hole solutions. This result can be understood as a consequence of an extremalization principle underlying the Euclidean action formulation of black hole thermodynamics. In this work, we emphasize that this extremalization approach is not restricted to perturbations around Einstein gravity. Instead, it can be applied to perturbations of more general higher-derivative gravity theories whose black hole solutions are already known and can be taken as the zeroth-order background. As an explicit illustration, we consider Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet gravity as the zeroth-order theory and study the first-order thermodynamic corrections induced by further higher-order curvature operators. We show that these corrections can be derived without solving the perturbed black hole solutions, both in asymptotically flat and asymptotically AdS spacetimes.
