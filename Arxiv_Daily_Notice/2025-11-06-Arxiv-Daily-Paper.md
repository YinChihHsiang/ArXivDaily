 - **Abstract**
 The presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs, $M_\text{BH}\sim10^9 M_\odot$) at $z>7$ remains a puzzle. While their existence appears to require exotic formation or growth processes, it is possible that BH mass estimates are incorrect due to differences from the low-$z$ quasars where BH mass scaling relations are calibrated. In this work, we employ JWST MIRI-MRS spectroscopy to measure the rest-frame optical/IR properties of the four highest-redshift known luminous type-1 quasars at $7.08\leq z<7.64$. We use three new broad lines to measure updated BH masses, H$\alpha$, Pa$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$, finding them to be in the range $(4-15)\cdot10^8 M_\odot$. Our black hole mass estimates from all tracers agree with each other and with previous, less accurate, ground-based measurements based on MgII. The flux ratios of the H lines deviate from expectations for case A and B recombination in the same way as in $z<3$ quasars, indicating similar physical conditions in the Broad Line Region. Rest-frame near-IR continuum emission from a hot dusty torus surrounding the accretion disc is unambiguously detected in all four objects. We model the emission with SKIRTOR and constrain the inclination (face-on) and the opening angle ($\theta=40-60^\circ$) of the tori. These constraints are consistent for the four objects and with expectations from luminous quasars. We estimate a total dust mass $(1-4)\cdot10^6 M_\odot$ in the tori, corresponding to $(0.2-7)\%$ of the total dust in the quasar host galaxies. Given observed accretion rates, these SMBHs will deplete their tori in only $\sim5$ Myr. Overall, we confirm that $z>7$ SMBHs in quasars could not have grown from stellar-remnant BHs if the radiative efficiency of accretion is $10\%$. We also find no evidence that inferred BH masses and accretion processes in $z>7$ quasars differ significantly from their near-identical counterparts at $z<3$.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar binaries in galactic centers are relevant to several observable phenomena, including hypervelocity stars, X-ray binaries, and mergers of stars and compact objects; however, we know little about the properties of these binaries. Past works have suggested that a small fraction of them should contract to a few stellar radii or collide, due to the co-operation of stellar tides and the eccentricity oscillations induced by the strong tidal field of the central massive black hole. We revisit this model with several updates. We first argue that when a binary's pericenter separation is driven down to a few stellar radii, diffusive excitation of stellar tides should quickly contract the orbit, saving the stars from collision. Instead, the stars should end up as a very tight binary. We then show that vector resonant relaxation and perturbations from passing stars -- effects not included in past models -- dramatically increase the prevalence of such encounters. In numerical experiments, we find that 1 in 5 binaries around 1 pc from Sgr A* should tidally contract in this way while still on the main sequence. This rate climbs to 3 in 5 around 0.01 pc, inward of which it plateaus. We briefly discuss observable implications of these results, with particular attention to young stellar binaries in the Galactic Center.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been observed in dwarf galaxies, yet the impact of black hole feedback in these low-mass systems remains unclear. To uncover the potential effects of AGN in the low-mass galaxy regime, we study the properties and demographics of active dwarf galaxies at $z=0$, using the IllustrisTNG simulations. We use data from the TNG50-1 simulation, selecting central galaxies with stellar masses in the range $8 \leq \log(M_\ast/{\rm M_\odot}) \leq 9.5$, and selecting AGN based on their Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$). We analyzed the properties and environment of AGN host galaxies and compared them with inactive control galaxies. The AGN fractions found in the simulation depend strongly on the threshold for $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ in the AGN selection, ranging from $\sim$ 1\% ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \geq 0.05$) to $\sim$ 24\% ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \geq 0.01$). In comparison with non-AGN galaxies of similar stellar and halo mass, dwarf AGN hosts are deficient in neutral gas, having $\sim$ 3.9 times less neutral mass, in qualitative agreement with observations. The dearth in neutral gas is stronger beyond two stellar half-mass radii ($r \gtrsim 3$ kpc), and AGN hosts have more extended gas components than non-AGN galaxies, with a gas half-mass radius, on average, $\gtrsim$ 10 kpc larger. AGN hosts are also slightly less star-forming, but have no differences in local environment. We found that AGN can significantly decrease the neutral gas component of dwarf galaxies, a direct effect of the high-accretion feedback mode employed in IllustrisTNG. However, it is important to test our findings with observations to unveil the complete role of AGN in dwarf galaxies. In TNG50, dwarf AGN fractions are an order of magnitude larger than those observed, motivating a detailed investigation to precisely quantify the mismatch between simulations and observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) are believed to form primarily through mergers of less massive progenitors, leaving behind numerous traces of violent formation histories, such as stellar streams and shells. A particularly striking signature of these mergers is the formation of supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, which can create depleted stellar cores through interactions with stars on radial orbits - a process known as core scouring. The secondary SMBH in such systems may still carry a dense stellar envelope and thereby remain observable for some time as a secondary nucleus, while it is sinking towards the shared gravitational potential of the merged galaxy. We leverage Euclid's Q1 Early Release data to systematically search for secondary nuclei in ETGs. We present a preliminary sample of 666 candidate systems distributed over 504 hosts (some of which contain multiple secondary nuclei). The vast majority of these fall at separations of 3 kpc to 15 kpc, indicative of normal mergers. 44 fall at projected separations of less than 2 kpc. We argue those candidates at very close angular separations are unlikely to be a consequence of chance alignments. We show that their stellar masses are mostly too large for them to be globular clusters and that a significant subset are unresolved even at Euclid's spatial resolution, rendering them too small to be dwarf galaxies. These may represent the highest-density nuclei of a previously merged galaxy, currently sinking into the centre of the new, common gravitational potential and thus likely to host a secondary SMBH. We then demonstrate that convolutional neural networks offer a viable avenue to detect multiple nuclei in the thirty-times larger sky coverage of the future Euclid DR1. Finally, we argue that our method could detect the remnants of a recoil event from two merged SMBHs.

 - **Abstract**
 GHZ2 is among the highest-redshift galaxies discovered to date, exhibiting a spectrum rich with prominent emission lines in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and optical. These features raise critical questions about the mechanism powering this nebular emission, in particular the extremely strong C IV$\lambda$1548 emission (rest-frame EW $=$ 45 Angstrom). Here we aim to quantify the AGN contribution within this system using the BEAGLE-AGN tool to simultaneously fit the spectrum and photometry of GHZ2. We consider a range of models with and without AGN components, allowing us to disentangle the stellar and AGN contribution of GHZ2 for the first time. We conclude that a partial contribution by an AGN is significantly favored based on the Bayes factor comparison to models without an AGN component, measuring an AGN contribution of 54$^{+1}_{-1}$% and 26$^{+4}_{-2}$% for the C IV$\lambda$1548 and C III]$\lambda$1908 emission lines, respectively. We obtain an estimate for the black hole mass using the accretion luminosity ($L_{acc}$) from the best fit BEAGLE-AGN model, computing a value of log$_{10}$(M$_{BH}$/M$_{\odot}$) = 7.20$^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, for an Eddington ratio of $\eta$ = 0.5 (with a systematic uncertainty of $\sim$1 dex). The inferred black hole mass to stellar mass ratio is 0.05$^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$, consistent with other high redshift AGN systems. If the black hole interpretation is confirmed, GHZ2 would represent the most distant black hole identified to date, making it an ideal laboratory to study AGN growth and their role in shaping high-redshift galactic evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the multi-phase circumgalactic medium (CGM) of emission line galaxies (ELGs) at $z\sim1.5$, traced by MgII$\lambda2796$, $\lambda2803$ and CIV$\lambda1548$, $\lambda1550$ absorption lines, using approximately 7,000 ELG-quasar pairs from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Our results show that both the mean rest equivalent width ($W_{0}$) profiles and covering fractions of MgII and CIV increase with ELG stellar mass at similar impact parameters, but show similar distributions when normalized by the virial radius. Moreover, warm CIV gas has a more extended distribution than cool MgII gas. The dispersion of MgII and CIV gas velocity offsets relative to the galaxy redshifts rises from $\sim100 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$ within halos to $\sim 200 \, \rm km \, s^{-1}$ beyond. We explore the relationships between MgII and CIV $W_{0}$ and show that the two are not tightly coupled: at a fixed absorption strength of one species, the other varies by several-fold, indicating distinct kinematics between the gas phases traced by each. We measure the line ratios, FeII/MgII and CIV/MgII, of strong MgII absorbers and find that at $<0.2$ virial radius, the FeII/MgII ratio is elevated, while the CIV/MgII ratio is suppressed compared with the measurements on larger scales, both with $\sim4-5\, \sigma$ significance. We argue that multiphase gas that is not co-spatial is required to explain the observational results. Finally, by combining with measurements from the literature, we investigate the redshift evolution of CGM properties and estimate the neutral hydrogen, metal, and dust masses in the CGM of DESI ELGs -- found to be comparable to those in the ISM.

 - **Abstract**
 The high redshift merger rate and mass distribution of black hole binaries (BHBs) is a direct probe to distinguish astrophysical black holes (ABHs) and primordial black holes (PBHs), which can be studied using the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background (SGWB). The conventional analyses solely based on the power spectrum are limited in constraining the properties of the underlying source population under the assumption of a non-sporadic Gaussian distribution. However, recent studies have shown that SGWB will be sporadic and non-Gaussian in nature, which will cause non-zero 'spectral correlation' depending on the high redshift merger rate and mass distribution of the compact objects. In this work, we present the first spectral covariance analysis of the SGWB using data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration during the third and the first part of the fourth observing runs. Our analysis indicates that the current spectral correlation is consistent with non-stationary noise, yielding no detection from the current data and providing only upper bounds between frequencies in the range 25 Hz to 100 Hz. This upper bound on the spectral correlation translates to the upper bounds on the mass-dependent merger rate of PBHs between $2.4\times10^{4}$ and $2.3\times10^{2} \rm ~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ (at ${\rm z} = 1 $ ) with a log-normal mass distribution with median masses between $20 ~M_{\odot}$ and $120 ~M_{\odot}$. This provides a stringent upper bound on the PBH merger rate at high redshift and hence puts constraints on the PBH formation scenario even in the presence of large spatial clustering. In the future, detection of this signal will lead to direct evidence of the high-redshift black hole population using gravitational waves.

 - **Abstract**
 In our local-to-global cosmological framework, cosmic acceleration arises from local dynamics in an inhomogeneous Einstein-de Sitter (iEdS) universe without invoking dark energy. An iEdS universe follows a quasilinear coasting evolution from an Einstein-de Sitter to a Milne state, as an effective negative curvature emerges from growing inhomogeneities without breaking spatial flatness. Acceleration can arise from structure formation amplifying this effect. We test two realizations, iEdS(1) and iEdS(2), with $H_0=\{70.24,74.00\}\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$ and $\Omega_{\mathrm{m},0}=\{0.290,0.261\}$, against CMB, BAO, and SN Ia data. iEdS(1) fits better than $\Lambda$CDM and alleviates the $H_0$ tension, whereas iEdS(2) fully resolves it while remaining broadly consistent with the data. Both models yield ${t_0\simeq13.64\ \mathrm{Gyr}}$, consistent with globular-cluster estimates.

#### Electromagnetic variability from circumbinary discs around binary black holes during their post-decoupling epoch

 - **Abstract**
 We present general-relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of inviscid circumbinary discs (CBDs) around near equal-mass binary black holes (BBH) in the binary-disc post-decoupling epoch. We use an approximate BBH spacetime with a post-Newtonian inspiral motion trajectory from ${\sim}80 (M/10^7 \mathrm{M_\odot}) \, \mbox{days}$ (separation of ${\sim}\,30$ gravitational radii) to ${\sim}100 (M/10^7 \mathrm{M_\odot}) \, \mbox{minutes}$ before merger. Initial data for the inspiral runs are produced from circular-orbits runs covering the formation timescale of the overdense {\lq}lump{\rq}, orbiting the CBD inner edge. The CBD non-axisymmetries (spiral waves and lump) lead to non-negligible angular momentum transport with effective viscosity ${\alpha_\mathrm{eff} \, {\sim} \, 10^{-3}{- 2\times 10}^{-2}}$. We post-process these simulations with a general-relativistic ray-tracing code to obtain synthetic observations in thermal emission. We find the lump and its associated electromagnetic (EM) modulation, already reported in the pre-decoupling epoch, to survive post-decoupling up until the end of the simulation. For LISA sources, our findings point to an active EM signature in UV during optimal gravitational wave source localization. For PTA sources and current BBH candidates detected through their optical periodicity: the lump{ in a low-viscosity CBD is a possible, though not unique, origin} for the observed periodicity.

#### The strong Fe K line and spin of the black-hole X-ray binary MAXI J1631-479

 - **Abstract**
 We study the transient black hole binary MAXI J1631--479 in its soft spectral state observed simultaneously by the NICER and NuSTAR instruments. Its puzzling feature is the presence of a strong and broad Fe K line, while the continuum consists of a strong disk blackbody and a very weak power-law tail. The irradiation of the disk by a power-law spectrum fitting the tail is much too weak to account for the strong line. Two solutions were proposed in the past. One invoked an intrinsic Fe K disk emission, and the other invoked disk irradiation by the returning blackbody emission. We instead find that the strong line is naturally explained by the irradiation of the disk by the spectrum from Comptonization of the disk blackbody by coronal relativistic electrons. The shape of the irradiating spectrum at $\lesssim$10 keV reflects that of the disk blackbody; it is strongly curved and has a higher flux than that of a fit with a power-law irradiation. That flux accounts for the line. While this result is independent of the physical model used for the disk intrinsic emission, the value of the fitted spin strongly depends on it. When using a Kerr disk model for a thin disk with a color correction, the fitted spin corresponds to a retrograde disk, unlikely for a Roche-lobe overflow binary. Then, a model accounting for both the disk finite thickness and radiative transfer yields a spin of $a_*\approx0.8$--0.9, which underlines the strong model-dependence of X-ray spin measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar models are calculated in the approximation of a uniform density distribution. Variational method was used for determination of the boundary of a stability loss, for stellar masses in the range from 2 up to $10^5$ $M_{\odot}$. The effects of the general relativity had been taken into account. The equation of state in the temperature and density ranges $10^9 < T < 10^{10} K$, $10^5 < \rho < 10^{10}\,\frac{g}{cm^3}$ had been taken from the work of Imshennik and Nadyozhin (1965). The critical parameters for the values of entropy and stellar masses differ from more accurate values, obtained using a more complicated variant of accepted density distribution, not more than 12$\%$.

 - **Abstract**
 In 2024, a failed supernova candidate, M31-2014-DS1, was reported in the Andromeda galaxy (M31), located at a distance of approximately 770 kpc. In this paper, we search for neutrinos from this failed supernova using data from Super-Kamiokande (SK). Based on the estimated time of black hole formation inferred from optical and infrared observations, we define a search window for neutrino events in the SK data. Using this window, we develop a dedicated analysis method for failed supernovae and apply it to M31-2014-DS1, by conducting a cluster search using the timing and energy information of candidate events. No significant neutrino excess is observed within the search region. Consequently, we place an upper limit on the electron antineutrino luminosity from M31-2014-DS1 and discuss its implications for various failed SN models and their neutrino emission characteristics. Despite the 18 MeV threshold adopted to suppress backgrounds, the search remains sufficiently sensitive to constrain the Shen-TM1 EOS, yielding a 90% confidence level upper limit of 1.76 \times 10^{53} erg on the electron antineutrino luminosity, slightly above the expected value of 1.35 \times 10^{53} erg.

 - **Abstract**
 We present that the broad feature usually observed in X-ray spectra can be explained by a ray-traced emission from a two-slab system containing a dissipative, warm corona on top of an accretion disk in an AGN. Such an accretion flow is externally illuminated by X-ray radiation from a lamp located above a central SMBH. Thermal lines from highly ionized iron ions (FeXXV and FeXXVI), caused by both internal heating and reflection from the warm corona, can be integrated into an observed broad line profile due to the close vicinity of the SMBH. We investigate the dependence of the broad line profile by varying the SMBH spin parameter, viewing angle, lamp height, and dissipation factor. Our results introduce a new method to probe properties of the warm corona using high-resolution spectroscopic measurements. We use the photoionization code TITAN to compute local ion populations and emission line profiles, and the ray-tracing code GYOTO to include relativistic effects on the outgoing X-ray spectrum. In our models, the temperature of the inner atmosphere covering the disk can reach values of 10^7 - 10^8 K due to internal warm corona dissipation and external illumination, which is adequate for generating the highly ionized iron lines. These lines can undergo significant gravitational redshift near the black hole, leading to a prominent spectral feature centered around 6.4 keV. For all computed models, the relativistic corrections shift highly ionized iron lines to the X-ray region, usually attributed to fluorescent emission from the illuminated skin of an accretion disk. Hence, in the case of a warm corona covering the inner disk regions, the resulting theoretical line profile under strong gravity is a sum of different iron line transitions, and those originating from highly ionized iron contribute the most to the observed total line profile in AGN.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study determining the spatial offset between the position of the supermassive black hole (as traced through their broad line regions) and the host galaxy in six $z > 6$ quasars. We determined the host galaxy's position from $\lesssim$$0.1^{\prime\prime}$ ($\lesssim$ 600 pc) resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) [CII] 158 $\mu m$ and corresponding dust continuum imaging. We determined the quasar's position from $\lesssim$ 400 pc resolution James Webb Space Telescope Near-Infrared Camera (JWST NIRCam) imaging. We estimated the observational uncertainties on the quasar's position using astrometric data from the Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics (GAIA) of field stars within the NIRCam images. We find that all six quasars are found within the central $\sim 400$ pc of their host galaxy dust continuum and [CII] emission. Apparent offsets seen in rest-frame optical JWST observations are not detected in our ALMA data, suggesting they likely result from dust obscuration rather than a true physical separation between the SMBH and its host galaxy. Kinematic modeling of these data further reveals that none of the galaxies show evidence for recent merger activity, and most of the galaxies can be accurately modeled using a simple disk model. The lack of an offset supports theoretical models that predict that positional offset within these galaxies are either short-lived or intrinsically rare.

 - **Abstract**
 A remarkable span of frontier astrophysics, from gravitational-wave archaeology to the origin of the elements to interpreting snapshots of the earliest galaxies, depends sensitively on our understanding of massive star formation and evolution in near-pristine, relatively enriched gas. From the surprisingly massive black holes detected by LIGO/Virgo to highly ionized nebulae with peculiar enrichment patterns observed in galaxies at Cosmic Dawn, evidence is mounting that our understanding of massive-star populations at very low metallicity remains critically incomplete. The fundamental limitation is the hand nature has dealt us: only a few star-forming galaxies within $\lesssim$1 Mpc can currently be resolved into individual stars, and none reach the extreme metallicities and star-formation intensities that characterized the early Universe. With an ultraviolet integral-field spectrograph aboard the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), this barrier will finally be broken. HWO will bring rare, actively star-forming, extremely metal-poor dwarf galaxies at $\sim$10-20 Mpc such as I Zw 18 within reach of resolved UV-optical spectroscopy, providing our first direct, statistical view of individual massive stars and the feedback they drive at $>$30 $M_\odot$ and $<$10% $Z_\odot$. This science is deeply synergistic with many next-generation facilities, yet requires the unique combination of spatial resolution and UV/optical sensitivity that only HWO can provide. The massive star science enabled by HWO within the Local Volume represents a transformational advance in our ability to probe the earliest stellar populations - those that seeded the Milky Way and other galaxies with the first heavy elements, and paved the way for life in the transparent, reionized Universe we inhabit today.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the mechanics of stationary axisymmetric non-Killing horizons, which emerge in spacetimes that do not enjoy the symmetry known as circularity -- as is commonly the case for rotating black holes beyond general relativity. Specifically, we define and compute three notions of surface gravity: inaffinity, normal, and peeling; and find that the inaffinity and normal definitions generically differ, while the normal and peeling definitions always agree, although none of them is constant over the horizon. We then derive a version of Smarr's formula, which appears to involve an average over the horizon of the normal surface gravity. We also compute, via the tunnelling method, the spectrum of Hawking's radiation, verifying that its temperature is controlled by the (non-constant) peeling surface gravity. Finally, we recapitulate the status of the four laws of black hole mechanics in situations in which the event horizon fails to be Killing. Our results thus pave the way to a deeper understanding of black hole thermodynamics beyond general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 The ''ringdown'' stage of gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole mergers, mainly consisting of a superposition of quasinormal modes emitted by the merger remnant, is a key tool to test fundamental physics and to probe black hole dynamics. However, ringdown models are known to be accurate only in the late-time, stationary regime. A key open problem in the field is to understand if these models are robust when extrapolated to earlier times, and if they can faithfully recover a larger portion of the signal. We address this question through a systematic time-domain calculation of the mismatch between non-precessing, quasi-circular ringdown models parameterised by the progenitor binary's degrees of freedom and full numerical relativity inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) simulation catalog. For the best-performing models, the mismatch is typically in the range $[10^{-6}, 10^{-4}]$ for the $(\ell,|m|)= (2,2)$ harmonic, and $[10^{-4}, 10^{-2}]$ for higher-order modes. Our findings inform ongoing observational searches for quasinormal modes, and underscore the need for improved modeling of higher-order modes to meet the sensitivity requirements of future gravitational-wave detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct exact black-hole solutions free of curvature singularities, sourced by dark matter halos described by galactic density profiles. Regularity of the geometry is ensured by adopting the relation $P_{r}=-\rho$ between radial pressure and density, which is consistent with the phenomenological freedom of halo models. In particular, the sufficiently dense Einasto and Dehnen-type profiles for the dark matter halo can produce asymptotically flat solutions of singularity-free black holes embedded in the galactic environment. The resulting regular black holes surrounded by dark matter are shown to be stable under axial perturbations. We further compute the shadow radii and Lyapunov exponents associated with the photon circular orbits around these black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 In this article, we extend our previously presented analytical formulas (Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 12, 124055) for describing light rays passing near or emitted in the vicinity of compact objects to a broader class of spherically symmetric, static spacetimes, including the Johansen-Psaltis and Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric families. The generalized formulas retain the simplicity and accuracy of the original approach while allowing for more general deviations from Schwarzschild geometry. These expressions provide an approximate yet accurate mapping between emission points and the image plane of an asymptotic observer, enabling fast analytical computations of accretion disk images, polarization of the emitted radiation, luminosity curves associated with pulsars, and other related applications. As examples, we compute isoradial curves for several metric families and the Stokes parameters Q and U for a hot spot orbiting near a black hole described by one of the studied metrics, presenting the corresponding polarization (QU) curves.

 - **Abstract**
 The static spherical vacuum solution in a bumblebee gravity model where the bumblebee field $B_\mu$ has a two-component space-like, light-like, and time-like vacuum expectation value $b_\mu$ is studied. Based on the results, we present a comprehensive classification of the static spherical vacuum solutions in bumblebee gravity with general vacuum expectation values. We find that the model becomes degenerate for a specific set of parameter combinations, where the solution can be characterized by an arbitrary function, which indicates that the non-minimally coupled massless vector tensor theory is ill-defined when $\xi=\kappa/2$. We also find that contrary to the situation in general relativity, the bumblebee gravity admits the exact Schwarzschild solution with non-zero matter distributions of certain forms. The implications of this result are discussed, suggesting that the experimental constraints within the solar system would be invalid.

 - **Abstract**
 The exact measurement of neutrino mass remains a longstanding issue. So far, there has been much success in providing an upper bound for the neutrino rest mass, both theoretically and experimentally. In this work, by exploring the critical radius of a beam of polarized quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle deflecting around a classical Kerr black hole, we attempt to provide an additional testing ground for neutrino mass, as well as the mass of other proposed ultra-light particles yet to be determined. Notably, the quantum Dirac equation is used to derive a MPD-like equation satisfied by the polarized beam of massive spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles and identify the effective spin in the spin tensor with the particle's intrinsic quantum spin, confirming the previous theoretical result that the MPD equation can be in fact applied to particles' intrinsic spin. The result of this work shows that corrections of relative magnitude $>10^{-12}$ can be achieved for spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles with rest mass equal to $1 eV/c^2$ deflecting around a solar mass Kerr black hole. Although highly theoretical, a new method of extracting the lower bound for the neutrino mass individually is also proposed due to the behavior of the quantum spin correction.

#### Wald Entropy in Extended Modified Myrzakulov Gravity Theories: \(f(R, T, Q, R_{μν}T^{μν}, R_{μν}Q^{μν}, \dots)\)

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate black hole entropy in a broad class of modified Myrzakulov gravity theories defined by generalized Lagrangians of the form \( \mathcal{L} = \alpha R + F(T, Q, R_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}, R_{\mu\nu}Q^{\mu\nu}, \dots) \), where \( R \), \( T \), and \( Q \) represent curvature, torsion, and non-metricity scalars. Using the vielbein formalism, we derive the Wald entropy for various subclasses of these models, extending the classical entropy formula to accommodate non-Riemannian geometry. Our focus is on how the additional geometric degrees of freedom modify the entropy expression. The analysis shows that such corrections arise systematically from the extended structure of the action and preserve diffeomorphism invariance. These results refine the theoretical framework for gravitational thermodynamics in extended geometry settings.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive new exact gravitational wave solutions with dynamical torsion and nonmetricity tensors in the framework of cubic Metric-Affine Gravity (MAG). For this purpose, we consider the full algebraic classification of the gravitational field in general metric-affine geometries and impose a set of Type N conditions on the field strength tensors that implement the kinetics of torsion and nonmetricity in a particular cubic MAG model, recently considered to eliminate ghostly instabilities from the vector and axial sectors of the theory. The new solutions represent pp-waves characterised by a metric function that includes the dynamical contributions of the torsion and nonmetricity tensors provided by the field equations of the model. In particular, these quantities induce a scalar polarisation mode in the gravitational-wave spectrum, thus offering a distinctive phenomenological signature beyond the ordinary tensor polarisation modes of General Relativity.

#### Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals Embedded in Dark Matter Halo I:Existence of Homoclinic Orbit and Near-Horizon Chaos

 - **Abstract**
 We study the existence of homoclinic orbit and the onset of chaotic motion for a massive particle moving around a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a Dehnen-(1,4,5/2) type dark matter halo, within the extreme-mass-ratio limit q = m/M << 1, where m and M are the masses of the particle and the central black hole, respectively. The presence of the halo modifies the spacetime curvature and consequently deforms the effective potential governing the particle's motion. Using the Hamiltonian formulation, we derive the conditions under which unstable circular orbit and the associated homoclinic trajectory arise, marking the separatrix between bound and plunging motion. By analyzing the effective potential and the corresponding phase-space structure, we identify the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics in the near-horizon region. Numerical analyses through Poincare sections and Lyapunov exponents calculations demonstrate that increasing the halo density, scale radius along with energy amplifies nonlinear effects which leads to chaos eventually. We demonstrate that within a dark matter halo environment, the dynamical stability of particle motion can be significantly altered without violating the universal surface gravity bound on chaos. This work provides a deeper understanding of horizon-induced chaos in astrophysically realistic environments and serves as a theoretical basis for exploring its possible imprints on gravitational wave signals in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals system.

 - **Abstract**
 Using holographic realizations of the Araki-Lieb (AL) inequality, we show that typical pure states in large-N holographic conformal field theories (CFTs) possess two characteristic length scales determined solely by energy and conserved charges: a microscopic L_UV and an infrared L_IR > L_UV. Degrees of freedom between these scales effectively factorize -- one purifying the ultraviolet (scales < L_UV) and the other the infrared sector (scales > L_IR). Remarkably, the pure-state factor including the ultraviolet sector is determined solely by energy and conserved charges up to exponentially suppressed corrections. Our results imply that all black holes in anti-de Sitter space can be isolated from an asymptotic region, the "corona", formed by the inclusion of entanglement wedges for which the AL inequality is saturated, and that an effective factorization emerges in the buffer region between the corona and the outer horizon.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the BPS states of $U(N)_k\times U(1)_{-k}$ vector Chern-Simons theory on a sphere at weak coupling $\lambda=\frac{N}{k}\ll 1$, dual to an AdS$_4$ higher spin gravity. Higher spin currents are well known to be anomalous at $\lambda\neq 0$. We show that these non-BPS higher spin particles form multi-particle `BPS bounds' at low energy, and interpret them as a primordial form of small black hole states. We also construct a new heavy BPS operator at $N=2$. We study the BPS phases of this system from the large $N$ index at Planckian `temperatures'. The deconfined saddles at high temperature exist only above a threshold, similar to the BTZ black holes. The low temperature saddles are given by novel 2-cut eigenvalue distributions. Their phase transition involves subtle issues like the holomorphic anomaly and the background independence, whose studies we initiate. In particular, we obtain a lower bound on the critical temperature by studying the eigenvalue instantons.

 - **Abstract**
 How can we detect the difference in the effects of the quantum corrections included in the metric of a spacetime and the quantum corrections included in the entropy of such a system? Recently, J. Barrow designed an expression based directly on black hole (BH) entropy of Bekenstein-Hawking where the geometry of the event horizon can also have an intricate, non smooth, structure, a fractal geometry. These fractal features are represented by a numerical constant parameter, the fractal parameter (FP). Since then, several interesting issues have been explored in the literature. In this work, we investigate the inversion temperature connected to the Joule-Thomson expansion from the thermodynamics of AdS-Reissner-Nördstrom BH by using the Barrow entropy equation where the FP has several values within a certain validity interval. We include quantum corrections in a cosmological fluid that can describe phantom dark matter or quintessence, both in a Kiselev scenario. The description of such physical systems also involves numerical solutions concerning the FP. The results are shown by temperature-pressure curves for multiple values of the parameters of the system used here. In conclusion of our analysis, we also show isenthalpic curves corresponding to fixed-mass BH processes, and we respond numerically to the question made in the first line of this abstract.

 - **Abstract**
 Scrambling is a diagnostic of quantum chaos in strongly coupled systems, and plays a central role in the holographic description of black hole dynamics. We study scrambling in high-temperature holographic CFTs, with an emphasis on perturbations dual to particles on infalling and bound trajectories in the bulk description. For BTZ and AdS-Schwarzschild geometries, we derive an analytic expression relating the difference in scrambling times to the particles' kinematics. We match this to a 2d CFT computation by constructing the smeared operator that creates the bulk particle with the desired kinematics and calculating the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). For higher-dimensional holographic CFTs, the scrambling slows and eventually ceases when the dual bulk particle has insufficient energy to overcome the angular momentum barrier.
