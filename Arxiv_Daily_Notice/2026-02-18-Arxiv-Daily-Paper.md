#### UV and Optical Signatures of Late-time Disk Instabilities in Tidal Disruption Events

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are unique probes of evolving accretion in supermassive black holes. Recent models of TDE disks show that they undergo brief thermal instabilities with temporal super-Eddington accretion at late times, which has been suggested as a possibility to explain the ubiquitous late radio emergence in TDEs. We model the ultraviolet (UV) and optical signatures of such disk instabilities, expected from the accretion power being reprocessed by the optically-thick outflow following super-Eddington accretion. Our model predicts brief UV-bright transients lasting for days, with luminosities of $10^{42}$-$10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in near-UV and $10^{41}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in optical for a typical TDE by a $10^6~M_\odot$ black hole. These could be detectable by near-future surveys such as ULTRASAT, Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Argus Array, for TDEs of redshifts out to $\approx 0.1$. We further conduct a search for these transients in existing nearby TDEs using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility, placing upper limits on the flare rate for each TDE of $1$-$2$ yr$^{-1}$ dependent on the outflow mass. In the era of future surveys, combined UV/optical and radio monitoring would be an important test to the disk instability phenomena, as well as its explanation for the late-time radio emission in TDEs.

 - **Abstract**
 Circumgalactic gas around massive galaxies generally has a volume-filling component -- an atmosphere -- with a temperature determined by the potential-well depth of the galaxy's halo. If the atmosphere is near hydrostatic equilibrium and is stable to convection, then it can remain nearly homogeneous, as long as it is not too dense. But if its density is great enough, it becomes prone to producing a rain of cold clouds that fall toward the galaxy's center and accrete onto its central black hole. Here we explain how relatively weak magnetic fields enhance a galactic atmosphere's tendency to produce cold clouds and how the cold gas becomes organized into vertically elongated, highly magnetized filaments descending at sub-Keplerian speeds. It is intended to complement recent numerical simulations of the process and to serve as a guide to interpreting both simulations and observations of the filamentary gas in hot galactic atmospheres.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the properties of 56 massive (M$_{\rm{\star}}$ > 10$^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) galaxies at $z<1$ that host AGN, detected via their broadband optical variability in the VST-COSMOS survey. VST-COSMOS provides a nearly-identical single visit depth ($r$ $\sim$ 24.6 mag) and temporal baseline (eleven years) as the forthcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), albeit in a much smaller 1 deg$^2$ footprint (four orders of magnitude smaller than that of the LSST). We compare the properties (morphologies, the presence of interactions, rest-frame colours and environment) of our AGN to galaxies in a control sample, which are drawn from the non-variable population and matched in redshift and stellar mass to their AGN counterparts. The fraction of AGN with early-type morphology ($\sim$55 per cent) and the fraction that is interacting ($\sim$23 per cent) are similar to what is observed in the controls, suggesting that these AGN are not primarily triggered by interactions. Similarly, the AGN and controls do not show strong differences in their rest-frame $(u-z)$ colours or local environment, suggesting that neither the recent star formation histories nor the surroundings of the AGN are strongly atypical of the general galaxy population. This study provides a glimpse into forthcoming AGN science using the LSST. With vastly improved statistics, LSST will offer unprecedented insights into AGN demographics, host-galaxy evolution and the processes that fuel supermassive black holes, potentially reshaping our understanding of their place in the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how supermassive black holes (BHs) couple to their host galaxies across a vast spatial and temporal dynamic range remains a central challenge in galaxy evolution. Using the multizone framework -- designed to capture bidirectional inflow--outflow from the event horizon to the Bondi scale -- we present a suite of long-duration GRMHD simulations spanning BH spins $|a_\ast|=0$--0.9 and Bondi radii $R_B/r_g=4\times10^2$--$2\times10^6$. From these simulations we derive spin-dependent subgrid prescriptions from first principles, applicable to hot accretion flows with low-Eddington ratios ($f_{\rm Edd}\lesssim10^{-3}$), for adoption in cosmological simulations and semi-analytic models. We provide compact analytic fits for the time-averaged accretion rate $\dot M(R_B,a_\ast)$ and feedback power $\dot E_{\rm fb}(R_B,a_\ast)$ with respect to the Bondi rate $\dot{M}_B$, which are largely insensitive to the initial gas configuration and magnetic field strength. To capture intrinsic time-variability, we also quantify the full distributions of $\dot M$ and feedback efficiency $\eta$, both well described by lognormal statistics, with widths that increase toward larger $R_B$. We further measure self-consistent spin evolution in the hot accretion mode, finding that the spin-up parameter varies as $s(a_\ast)\simeq -3.7\,a_\ast$, which implies a very long spindown timescale $t_s\simeq 12(10^{-3}/f_{\rm Edd})\,{\rm Gyr}$. Thus, BH spins are effectively frozen during phases of quiescent accretion. Compared to conventional small-domain GRMHD calculations, our simulations, which reach dynamical equilibrium across horizon-to-galaxy scales, yield systematically different long-term accretion, feedback, and spin properties, cautioning against direct extrapolation from small-scale GRMHD simulations when constructing galactic-scale subgrid models.

#### Horizon-Brightened Acceleration Radiation and Optical Signatures of Generic Regular Black Holes from Nonlinear Electrodynamics

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) and optical signatures for a broad class of regular black holes sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics. The spacetimes considered are static, spherically symmetric, and nonsingular, and they include Bardeen-like, and Hayward-like regular black-hole limits as spacial cases. We characterize the horizon structure and thermodynamics properties, and we compute key optical observables by determining the photon-sphere location and the corresponding shadow size as seen by distant observers, including controlled perturbative limits and full numerical solutions. Using angular-size constraints for SgrA* and M87* from the Event Horizon Telescope and the GRAVITY collaboration, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to infer the admissible parameter ranges of the model and to quantify degeneracies among the black-hole mass and nonlinear-electrodynimcs parameters. On the quantum side, we develop the near-horizon reduction relevant for HBAR, showing that the dominant sector governing the detector response exhibits conformal behavior and leads to a thermal excitation spectrum governed by the horizon temperature. We formulate a Lindblad master-equation description of the radiation field, identify the thermal steady state, and derive an HBAR entropy-energy relation consistent with a Clausius-type first law. Finally, we establish a Wien-type displacement law for the HBAR spectrum, expressing the peak wavelength in terms of the horizon thermodynamics, thereby providing an additional observable link between nonlinear electrodynamics, regularity, and near-horizon quantum radiation.

#### Black-hole thermodynamics in doubly special relativity: local-frame MDRs and rainbow metrics
 - **Authors:** Abdelmalek Boumali

 - **Abstract**
 Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) deforms special-relativistic kinematics while preserving the relativity principle by introducing a second invariant scale, typically the Planck energy $E_{\rm Pl}$. Extending DSR-inspired modified dispersion relations (MDRs) to curved spacetimes is challenging, as ambiguous definitions of the deformation energy risk reintroducing preferred frames. We review three common extensions beyond flat spacetime: (i) MDRs in local orthonormal frames on fixed backgrounds, (ii) phase-space/Hamiltonian geometry with relative locality, and (iii) rainbow metrics. Using black-hole thermodynamics for static spherically symmetric horizons, we compare two implementations: (A) energy-independent background with local-frame MDR, and (B) energy-dependent rainbow metric. When the same prescription is used for the deformation energy scale $E_\star$, both approaches yield identical Hawking temperatures: \begin{equation} T(E_\star)=T_0\,\frac{g(E_\star/E_{\rm Pl})}{f(E_\star/E_{\rm Pl})}\,,\qquad T_0=\frac{\kappa_0}{2\pi}\,, \end{equation} where $\kappa_0$ is the classical surface gravity. This $g/f$ scaling holds for examples such as Amelino--Camelia-type MDRs (leading correction $\propto E p^2/E_{\rm Pl}$, giving $T(E_\star)\simeq T_0(1-\frac{\eta}{2}E_\star/E_{\rm Pl})$ for $\eta>0$) and the Magueijo--Smolin invariant ($f=g$, so $T(E_\star)=T_0$). Further DSR effects on evaporation (thresholds, phase space, greybody factors, composition laws) are discussed. Discrepancies in the literature arise mainly from different choices of $E_\star$ (energy at infinity vs.\ local frame). For macroscopic black holes, corrections are suppressed by $T_0/E_{\rm Pl}$ and become relevant only near the Planck regime, where full quantum gravity dominates.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate quantum and classical signatures of a Schwarzschild black hole embedded in a Hernquist dark matter halo. Starting from the exact spherically symmetric solution describing this composite system, we analyze particle production for both bosonic and fermionic fields using semiclassical techniques. Hawking radiation is derived through Bogoliubov transformations and independently via the tunneling method with energy conservation, allowing us to identify the effective temperature, emission spectrum, and the role of dark matter parameters in suppressing particle creation. The evaporation process is examined in the high-frequency regime, leading to modified evaporation times and emission rates relative to the vacuum Schwarzschild case. We further study absorption and scattering of massless scalar waves employing a partial-wave analysis, computing phase shifts, partial and total cross sections, and assessing the impact of the Hernquist scale radius and density on these observables. Finally, null and timelike geodesics are explored to characterize light propagation and particle motion in the presence of the dark matter halo.

#### Static black holes in an external uniform electromagnetic field: Reissner-Nordstrom accelerating in Bertotti-Robinson

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15462

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a detailed analysis of the non-twisting subcase of the large class of type D black holes with a non-aligned electromagnetic field, presented recently in [H. Ovcharenko and J. Podolsky, Phys. Rev. D 112 (2025) 064076]. We show that such exact solutions split into two main subclasses that (after a suitable re-parametrization) can be interpreted as either the uncharged Schwarzschild or C-metric in the external Bertotti-Robinson (BR) spacetime with geometry ${\mathrm{AdS}_2\times\mathrm{S}_2}$, or as the charged Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the external BR electromagnetic field. The distinction between these two subclasses is determined by the parameter $r_0$ that encodes relations between the external Maxwell field (given by the non-aligned components of the Faraday tensor ${\Phi_0=\Phi_2}$) and the Maxwell field created by the charge of the black hole (given by the aligned component $\Phi_1$). Namely, if ${r_0=0}$ then the electromagnetic field is fully determined by ${\Phi_0=\Phi_2}$, and one gets the C-metric in the BR universe (including also the non-accelerating Schwarzschild-BR black hole). But if ${r_0\neq 0}$ then the electromagnetic field is independently determined by both the external BR field and the field of a black hole itself, and this can be interpreted as the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole accelerating in the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. Even though such an interpretation of the spacetime family is quite simple, it contains a lot of subtleties (e.g. the no-charge limit of the RN-BR spacetime, the non-trivial dependence on the signs of the mass and charge of a black hole, extreme black holes, and others) which we carefully investigate in this work. We also show the explicit relation to solutions previously found by Van den Bergh and Carminati, and we discuss the connection to the Alekseev-Garcia and Alexeev solutions.

#### On the Limitations of Karmarkar's Condition in Static, Conformally Flat Spacetimes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15486

 - **Abstract**
 For a static and spherically symmetric spacetime, we investigate the class of exact solutions that arise when two fundamental geometric constraints are imposed simultaneously: the Karmarkar's condition and the vanishing of the Weyl tensor. These conditions restrict the curvature in such a way that the spacetime becomes conformally flat and belongs to the family of embedding class-I solutions. Even though the subsequent solutions namely, the Schwarzschild interior solution and the de Sitter solution are well known, the novelty of our presentation is that these solutions are shown to be a direct consequence of the imposed geometric constraints. The physical matter composition becomes highly constrained by the associated geometry under such conditions. The Schwarzschild interior solution describes the spacetime of an incompressible fluid sphere while the de Sitter solution corresponds to a vacuum energy dominated configuration. Interestingly, pressure anisotropy as well as `complexity factor' vanish identically once the Karmarkar's condition and the conformal flatness conditions are applied simultaneously. As these two geometric constraints alone are sufficient to determine the background spacetime uniquely, Karmarkar's condition might not be a suitable method for the development of realistic stellar models in a conformally flat spacetime unless one invokes other factors into consideration such as time-dependent metric potentials.

#### Displacement memory in regular black hole spacetimes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15523

 - **Abstract**
 Displacement memory, induced by a wave pulse in a regular black hole spacetime, is studied using geodesic (timelike) separation and geodesic deviation. The presence of the wave pulse in such a black hole is modeled via a function $H(u)$ appearing in a restricted version of a generic Bondi-Sachs type line element. Choosing a sech-squared profile for $H(u)$, we first study (numerically) geodesic separation and geodesic deviation in a flat background. Thereafter, similar investigations are carried out in the presence of the black hole, but in regions far away from the vicinity of the horizon. Our results suggest the presence of a distinct displacement memory effect, which depends on the value of the regularisation parameter $g$ as well as the pulse height. Between different types of regular black holes, one notices parameter-dependent changes in the net displacement memory. Further, a clear difference in the magnitude of displacement memory (at large $u$) in regular and singular black holes is also visible in our numerical results.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate several phenomenological aspects of a covariant quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordström black hole characterized by the mass $M$, electric charge $Q$, and the quantum correction parameter $\zeta$. We first study the motion of neutral test particles and derive the fundamental orbital and epicyclic frequencies, which are then employed to analyze different quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) models. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO. We then examine the scalar perturbations by deriving the Schrödinger-like radial equation and the corresponding effective potential. The influence of the parameters $Q$ and $\zeta$ on the perturbation potential and stability of the spacetime is discussed. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factor and the energy emission rate in the high-frequency (geometric-optics) regime, showing how the quantum correction modifies the absorption probability and radiation spectrum. Finally, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the black hole entropy and obtain the logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. We show that these corrections become important for small black holes, while for large horizon radius the standard thermodynamic behavior is recovered. Our analysis demonstrates that the quantum correction parameter leaves observable imprints on both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the spacetime and can be constrained through QPO observations.

#### ModMax-AdS Black Hole with Global Monopole as Source in Kalb-Ramond Gravity

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15570

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate in detail the thermodynamic properties of a spherically symmetric ModMax-AdS black hole sourced by a global monopole within the Kalb-Ramond gravity. We derive the key thermodynamic quantities, including the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity, and analyze how the geometric parameters influence these physical quantities. The first law of thermodynamics and the corresponding Smarr formula are explicitly verified. Furthermore, we study the thermodynamic criticality of the system by deriving the critical points and examining the effects of the space-time geometric parameters. We also obtain the inversion temperature and demonstrate that the minimum inversion temperature is modified by the space-time parameters. In addition, the sparsity of Hawking radiation and thermal fluctuations of the system are investigated, highlighting the effects of the parameters on the entropy corrections. Finally, we analyze the optical properties of the black hole, in particular the photon sphere and shadow radius, showing how these parameters influence these features.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the dynamics and gravitational-wave signatures of periodic orbits of spinning test particles moving in the equatorial plane around static, spherically symmetric black holes within the framework of Deser-Woodard nonlocal gravity. Based on the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, combined with the Tulczyjew spin supplementary condition, we derive the orbital dynamic equations for spinning particles moving in the equatorial plane and impose a timelike constraint to exclude unphysical superluminal trajectories. By comparing with the classical Schwarzschild black hole, we systematically analyze the effects of the nonlocal gravitational parameters $\zeta$ and $b$ on the effective potential governing the radial motion of particles and the innermost stable circular orbit. In addition, gravitational waveforms exhibit significant phase differences: an increase in $\zeta$ induces a phase delay, whereas an increase in $b$ results in a phase advance. A one-year simulation of the orbital evolution of an extreme mass ratio inspiral demonstrates that when $b=2$ and $\zeta\approx10^{-6}$, the mismatch between the gravitational waveforms predicted for the nonlocal gravity black hole and those for the Schwarzschild black hole reaches the distinguishable threshold ($\mathcal{M}=0.0125$), providing a basis for observational discrimination between general relativity and nonlocal gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 We establish results on the dynamics of interacting charged null fluids in general relativity, specifically in the context of the bouncing continuation proposed in [Ori91]. In this model - the setting for a number of prominent case studies on black hole formation - charged massless particles may instantaneously change direction (bounce) after losing all their 4-momentum due to electrostatic repulsion. We initiate the study of timelike bounce hypersurfaces in spherical symmetry: scenarios in which an incoming beam of charged null dust changes direction along a timelike surface $\mathcal{B}$, which is the (free) boundary of an interacting 2-dust region. We identify a novel decoupling of the equations of motion in this region. First, it is shown that every timelike curve segment $\gamma$ in the spherically symmetric quotient of Minkowski or Reissner-Nordström spacetimes arises as the bounce hypersurface $\mathcal{B}$ of a charged null dust beam incident from past null infinity $\mathcal{I}^-$. We construct a spacetime $(\mathcal{M},g_{\mu\nu})$ describing the full trajectory of the beam, which includes gluing to Reissner-Nordström and Vaidya regions. Across $\mathcal{B}$ the metric has regularity $g_{\mu\nu}\in C^{2,1}$ and satisfies Einstein's equation classically, while $C^\infty$ gluing may be achieved across all other interfaces. We also obtain examples of timelike bounce hypersurfaces terminating in a null point. Since these constructions are teleological, we secondly consider a given charged incoming beam from past null infinity. We formulate and solve a free boundary problem which represents the formation of a timelike bounce hypersurface. The result is conditional, applying only in the exterior region of a Reissner-Nordström spacetime, and subject to a technical regularity condition.

 - **Abstract**
 Exact nonperturbative solutions to hermitian one-matrix models, their topological string duals, as well as their double-scaling limits to multicritical and minimal string theories, may be obtained via the use of resurgent transseries. These solutions are generically resonant, entailing both eigenvalues and anti-eigenvalues, or, equivalently, both D-branes and negative-tension D-branes -- but are otherwise intricate to write down, having been previously addressed on a case-by-case approach. This work shows how there is a general and rather compact way to write down all these exact and fully nonperturbative transseries solutions in closed-form, immediately starting from the spectral geometry of the matrix model or string theory at hand, in the form of a discrete Fourier or Zak transform for their partition functions. This structure is inherently associated to the existence of anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes. The validity of these solutions is testable across all values of the parameters -- from weak to strong 't Hooft coupling, from small to large N; equivalently, from semi-classical to deeply quantum regimes -- and many such nonperturbative tests are performed against diverse examples ranging from matrix models to non-critical strings, fully validating our analytical and exact expressions. In particular, anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes are absolutely required to find sharp numerical matches. In order to study these solutions globally across their phase diagrams, however, complete non-linear Stokes data is still needed -- which will be addressed in a complementary follow-up paper.

#### Distinguishing Schwinger effect from Hawking radiation in Reissner-Nordstr{ö}m black holes via entanglement

 - **Abstract**
 A charged black hole can emit charged particles via two independent mechanisms: the Hawking radiation and the Schwinger effect, which are intertwined in the radiation spectrum. In this paper, we will show that the two effects can be distinguished by analyzing the entanglement entropy carried by the produced particle pairs. Explicitly, we apply the island formula to the near extremal Reissner-Nordstr{ö}m (RN) black hole to calculate the total entanglement entropy of the radiation. Meanwhile we use the heat kernel method to calculate the entanglement entropy of charged particle pairs produced solely from the Schwinger effect. By comparing with the total entanglement entropy, we obtain the entanglement entropy produced purely from the Hawking radiation. Consequently, the two effects are distinguishable in near extremal RN black holes after the Page time. Furthermore, we also employ the brick wall model and the Pauli-Villars regularization to derive the entanglement entropy from the Schwinger effect, which gives a slightly different result with that obtained from the heat kernel method.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the thermodynamic phase transitions of a four-dimensional charged anti-de Sitter black hole endowed with a non-minimal coupling of the form $F^{\alpha\beta}F^{\gamma\lambda}R_{\alpha\gamma\beta\lambda}$. Using perturbative methods, we derive a consistent black hole solution and analyze its thermodynamics through both conventional equilibrium techniques and a topological defect classification approach. The system displays van der Waals-like critical behavior, with a swallow-tail structure in the free energy and distinct phase branches. The topological analysis independently confirms the existence of critical points and classifies the system within the universal topological scheme for black hole thermodynamics.
