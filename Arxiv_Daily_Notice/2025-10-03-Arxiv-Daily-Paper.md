 - **Abstract**
 Following the recent evidence for a gravitational wave (GW) background found by pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments, the next major science milestone is resolving individual supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The detection of these systems could arise via searches using a power-based GW anisotropy model or a deterministic template model. In Schult et al. 2025, we compared the efficacy of these models in constraining the GW signal from a single SMBHB using realistic, near-future PTA datasets, and found that the full-signal deterministic continuous wave (CW) search may achieve detection and characterization first. Here, we continue our analyses using only the CW model given its better performance, focusing now on characterization milestones. We examine the order in which CW parameters are constrained as PTA data are accumulated and the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) grows. We also study how these parameter constraints vary across sources of different sky locations and GW frequencies. We find that the GW frequency and strain are generally constrained at the same time (or S/N), closely followed by the sky location, and later the chirp mass (if the source is highly evolving) and inclination angle. At fixed S/N, sources at higher frequencies generally achieve better precision on the GW frequency, chirp mass, and sky location. The time (and S/N) at which the signal becomes constrained is dependent on the sky location and frequency of the source, with the effects of pulsar terms and PTA geometry playing crucial roles in source detection and localization.

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most promising targets for Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) is identifying an individual supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) out of the population of binaries theorized to produce a gravitational wave background (GWB). In this work, we emulate an evolving PTA dataset, complete with an increasing number of pulsars and timing baseline, into which we inject a single binary on top of a Gaussian GWB signal. We vary the binary's source parameters, including sky position and frequency, and create an ensemble of simulated datasets with which we assess current Bayesian binary search techniques. We apply two waveform-based template models and a frequency-resolved anisotropy search to these simulations to understand how they compare in their detection and characterization abilities. We find that a template-based search including the full gravitational-wave signal structure (i.e., both Earth and pulsar effects of an incident GW) returns the highest Bayes Factors (BF), exceeding our estimator's capabilities by (S/N)~9-19, and has the most robust parameter estimation. Our anisotropy model attains a realization-median BF>10 at 7<(S/N)<15. Interestingly, despite being a deterministic model, the Earth-term template struggles to detect and characterize low-frequency binaries (5 nHz). These binaries require higher (S/N)~16-19 to reach the same BF threshold. This is likely due to neglected confusion effects between the pulsar and Earth terms. By contrast, the frequency-resolved anisotropy model shows promise for parameter estimation despite treating a binary's GW signal as excess directional GW power without phase modeling. Sky location and frequency parameter constraints returned by the anisotropy model are only surpassed by the Earth term template model at (S/N)~12-13. Milestones for a first detection using the full-signal GW model are included in a companion paper (Petrov et al. 2025).

 - **Abstract**
 From the luminous quasars at $z \sim 6$ to the recent $z \sim 9-11$ AGNs revealed by JWST, observations of the earliest black hole (BH) populations can provide unique constraints on BH formation and growth models. We use the BRAHMA simulations with constrained initial conditions to investigate BH assembly in extreme overdense regions. The simulations implement heavy seeds ($\sim 10^4-10^5 M_{\odot})$ forming in dense, metal-poor gas exposed to sufficient Lyman-Werner flux. With gas accretion modeled via Bondi-Hoyle formalism and BH dynamics and mergers using a subgrid dynamical friction scheme, we isolate the impact of seeding, dynamics, accretion, and feedback on early BH growth. With fiducial stellar and AGN feedback inherited from IllustrisTNG, accretion is strongly suppressed at $z \gtrsim 9$, leaving mergers as the dominant growth channel. Gas accretion dominates at $z \lesssim 9$, where permissive models (super-Eddington or low radiative efficiency) build $\sim 10^9\ M_{\odot}$ BHs powering quasars by $z \sim 6$, while stricter IllustrisTNG-based prescriptions yield much lower BH masses ($\sim 10^6-10^8\ M_{\odot}$). Our seed models strongly affect merger-driven growth at $z \gtrsim 9$: only the most lenient models (with $\sim 10^5\ M_{\odot}$ seeds) produce enough BH mergers to reach $\gtrsim 10^6\ M_{\odot}$ by $z \sim 10$, consistent with current estimates for GN-z11. Our dynamical friction model gives low merger efficiencies, hindering the buildup of $\gtrsim 10^7\ M_{\odot}$ BHs by $z \sim 9-10$, as currently inferred for GHZ9, UHZ1, and CAPERS-LRD-z9. If the BH-to-stellar mass ratios of these sources are indeed as extreme as currently inferred, they would require either very short BH merger timescales or reduced AGN thermal feedback. Weaker stellar feedback boosts both star formation and BH accretion and cannot raise these ratios.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the spatial relationships between multi-phase gas components and supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity in a sample of 25 cool core galaxy groups and clusters. Using high angular resolution observations from \textit{Chandra}, VLT/MUSE, and VLBA, we robustly locate the position, respectively, of the X-ray peak of the intracluster medium (ICM), of the H$\alpha$ peak of the warm ionized gas, and of the SMBH radio core on parsec scales. We identify spatial offsets between the X-ray peak of the hot gas and the SMBH in 80% of the systems, with an average displacement of $\langle\Delta^{\text{SMBH}}_{\text{X-ray}}\rangle = 4.8$ kpc (dispersion of $3.8$ kpc). In contrast, the peak of warm ionized gas traced by H$\alpha$ exhibits much smaller offsets ($\langle\Delta^{\text{SMBH}}_{\text{H}\alpha}\rangle = 0.6$ kpc; dispersion of $1.4$ kpc) and a lower incidence of displacement (15%). Our findings suggest that hot gas sloshing primarily drives the observed spatial offsets, with AGN-driven uplift contributing in some this http URL, systems with H$\alpha$ - SMBH offsets of $\geq$1 kpc uniformly lack detectable radio cores on VLBA scales, with upper limits on the 5~GHz power of $P_{5\,\text{GHz}} \leq 10^{21-22}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, while those without such offsets exhibit radio powerful AGN with pc-scale radio emission up to $P_{5\,\text{GHz}} \sim 10^{24-25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. This correlation indicates that centrally concentrated warm gas is critical for sustaining radio-loud SMBH activity, possibly supporting scenarios of cold-mode accretion. Overall, our results highlight the importance of high-angular-resolution, multi-wavelength observations for understanding the interplay between multiphase gas cooling and AGN fueling in central galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Progress in understanding the growth of accreting black holes remains hampered by a lack of sensitive coordinated multiwavelength observations. In particular, the mid-infrared (MIR) regime remains ill-explored except for jet-dominant states. Here, we present comprehensive follow-up of the black hole X-ray binary GX 339-4 during a disc-dominated state in its 2023/24 outburst as part of a multi-wavelength campaign coordinated around JWST/MIRI. The X-ray properties are fairly typical of soft accretion states, with a high-energy Comptonised tail. The source is significantly detected between 5-10$\mu$m, albeit at a faint flux level requiring MIR compact jet emission to be quenched by a factor of $\sim$300 or more relative to previous hard-state detections. The MIRI spectrum can be described as a simple power-law with slope $\alpha$ = +0.39$\pm$0.07 ($F_\nu$ $\propto$ $\nu^\alpha$), but surprisingly matches neither the radio/sub-mm nor the optical broadband slopes. Significant MIR stochastic variability is detected. Synchrotron radiation from the same medium responsible for high-energy Comptonisation can self-consistently account for the observed MIRI spectral-timing behaviour, offering new constraints on the physical conditions in the soft-state accretion disc atmosphere/corona. Alternative explanations, including a circumbinary disc or emission from a warm wind, fail to cleanly explain either the spectral properties or the variability. Multiwavelength timing cross-correlations show a puzzlingly long MIR lag relative to the optical, though at limited significance. We compile archival MIR and X-ray luminosities of transient black hole systems, including previously unreported detections of GX 339-4. These trace the evolution of the MIR-to-X-ray flux ratio with accretion state, and also reveal high MIR luminosities for GX 339-4 across all states. (abridged)

 - **Abstract**
 Eddington ratio is a paramount parameter governing the accretion history and life cycles of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This short review presents a multi-faceted view of the importance of the Eddington ratio spanning varied AGN studies. We find that the Eddington ratio is crucial for standardizing the Radius-Luminosity (R-L) relation - a necessary step for employing quasars (QSOs) as standardizable cosmological probes to help clarify the standing of the Hubble tension. In this data-driven era, we consolidated disparate aspects by developing novel relations borne out of large datasets, such as the robust, nearly universal anti-correlation between fractional variability and Eddington ratio derived from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, which is vital for interpreting forthcoming high-cadence surveys like Rubin Observatory's LSST. Addressing the conundrum where JWST results suggest an overabundance of massive high-redshift black holes, we demonstrate that local AGNs offer clarification: Changing-Look AGNs (CLAGNs), driven by rapid Eddington ratio shifts, cluster in the low-accretion regime, a rate independently confirmed by our integral field spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of a well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy, rich in high-ionization, forbidden, coronal lines. Conversely, for the high-redshift, high-luminosity population where traditional reverberation mapping (RM) is highly impractical, photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) offers a rapid alternative to constrain accretion disk sizes, enabling efficient estimates of black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Finally, we developed tailored semi-empirical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for extremely high-accretion quasars, successfully validating their characteristic extreme physical conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the optical and infrared properties of a sample of 24 radio transient sources discovered in the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). Previous studies of their radio emission showed that these sources resemble young gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources, but are less powerful and characterized by low-power jets. The bursts of radio activity in most cases are likely due to intrinsic changes in the accretion processes. However, for a few sources in this sample, we cannot rule out the possibility that their radio variability results from a tidal disruption event (TDE). In this work, we extend our analysis to the optical and infrared regimes, confirming that our sample of radio transients is not homogeneous in terms of their optical and infrared properties either. The host galaxies of most of these sources are massive ellipticals with emission dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses typical of radio-loud AGNs ($\rm >10^7\,M_{\odot}$), but exhibit very low accretion activity. In contrast, the sources for which a TDE origin is suspected are either pure star-forming galaxies or show significant ongoing star formation, similar to radio-selected optically-detected TDEs. Additionally, two of them exhibit infrared flares characteristic of TDEs, while the remaining sources do not display significant variability outside the radio regime. Moreover, the evolution of their radio brightness in the W3/radio diagnostic diagram, which we employ in our analysis, also sets our TDE candidates apart from the rest of the sample and resembles the radio variability seen in optically discovered TDEs with radio emission. Finally, based on our findings, we hypothesize that the mid-IR/radio relation can serve as a tool to distinguish between radio transients caused by TDEs and those originating from intrinsic AGN variability.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations from NICER in X-rays and LIGO/Virgo in gravitational waves have provided critical constraints on the mass, radius, and tidal deformability of neutron stars, imposing stringent limits on the equation of state (EOS) and the behavior of ultra-dense matter. However, several key parameters influencing the EOS, such as the maximum mass of neutron stars, spin-down rates, and the potential role of exotic matter in their cores, remain subject of ongoing debate. Here we present a new approach to constraining the EOS by analyzing the X-ray afterglows of some short gamma-ray bursts, focusing on "the internal plateau" phase and its abrupt decay, which reflect the spin-down and possible collapse of a supra-massive neutron star into a black hole. By linking critical neutron star masses with black hole formation criteria and the observational data from Swift's BAT and XRT instruments with compact object models, we explore three representative EOSs that range from "soft" to "stiff". Our result supports a maximum mass for neutron stars of approximately 2.39 solar masses at the threshold of black hole formation. This conclusion holds under assumptions of magnetar-powered X-ray plateaus, constant radiative efficiency, isotropic emission, and full Kerr black hole energy extraction; deviations could influence the inferred results. Our results demonstrate the critical role of neutron star/black hole physics in probing dense nuclear matter and provide a novel framework for exploring extreme astrophysical environments.

#### The Disk Plus (Failed) Wind System of 3C 47: A Story of Accretion Disks and Binary Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 [Abridged] Optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disks around supermassive black holes are thought to contribute to broad-line emission in type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, observed emission line profiles most often deviate from those expected from a rotating disk. This report examines the role of accretion disks in broad-line emission of Population B AGN characterized by relatively low accretion rates in which broad lines show large redward asymmetry both in H$\beta$ and Mg II$\lambda$ 2800. An unbiased comparison matching black hole mass and Eddington ratio suggests that the most powerful radio-loud quasars show the highest red-ward asymmetries in H$\beta$. These shifts can be accounted for by gravitational and transverse redshift effects, especially for black hole masses larger than $\approx$10$^{8.7}$ M$_\odot$. The analysis of the extremely jetted quasar 3C 47 adds another piece to the puzzle: not only are the low ionization profiles of 3C 47 well-described by a relativistic Keplerian accretion disk model, with line emission in the range 100 - 1,000 gravitational radii, but also the high-ionization line profiles can be understood as a combination of disk plus a failed wind contribution that is in turn hiding the disk emission. Constraints on radio properties and line profile variability suggest that 3C 47 might involve the presence of a second black hole with secondary-to-primary mass ratio $\sim$ 0.5. We conjecture that the double peakers - type-1 AGN with Balmer line profiles consistent with accretion disk emission - might have their emission truncated by the sweeping effect of a second black hole. In non-starving systems, the disk signal is plausibly masked by additional line emission, rendering the disk contribution harder to detect.

#### BAO miscalibration cannot rescue late-time solutions to the Hubble tension

 - **Abstract**
 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements play a key role in ruling out post-recombination solutions to the Hubble tension. However, because the data compression leading to these measurements assumes a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, their reliability in testing late-time modifications to $\Lambda$CDM has at times been called into question. We play devil's advocate and posit that fiducial cosmology assumptions do indeed affect BAO measurements in such a way that low-redshift acoustic angular scales (proportional to the Hubble constant $H_0$) are biased low, and test whether such a rescaling can rescue post-recombination solutions. The answer is no. Firstly, strong constraints on the shape of the $z \lesssim 2$ expansion history from unanchored Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) prevent large deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. In addition, unless $\Omega_m$ is significantly lower than $0.3$, the rescaled BAO measurements would be in strong tension with geometrical information from the Cosmic Microwave Background. We demonstrate this explicitly on several dark energy (DE) models ($w$CDM, CPL DE, phenomenologically emergent DE, holographic DE, $\Lambda_s$CDM, and the negative cosmological constant model), finding that none can address the Hubble tension once unanchored SNeIa are included. We argue that the $\Lambda_s$CDM sign-switching cosmological constant model possesses interesting features which make it the least unpromising one among those tested. Our results demonstrate that possible fiducial cosmology-induced BAO biases cannot be invoked as loopholes to the Hubble tension "no-go theorem", and highlight the extremely important but so far underappreciated role of unanchored SNeIa in ruling out post-recombination solutions.

 - **Abstract**
 Similarly to electromagnetic (EM) signals, gravitational lensing by intervening galaxies can also affect gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper, we estimate the strong-lensing rate of massive black hole mergers observed with LISA. Given the uncertainties in the source populations as well as in the population of galaxies at high redshift, we consider: six different source population models, including light and heavy seeds, as well as three lens population models, including redshift-independent and redshift-dependent evolution properties. Among all the scenarios explored, the expected number of strong lensed events detected in a 4-year observation time in LISA ranges between 0.13-231 with most of them having two (one) images detectable in the heavy (light) seed scenarios. The event numbers obtained correspond to 0.2%-0.9% of all detected unlensed events. Out of all the detectable strong-lensed events, up to 61% (in the light-seed scenario) and 1% (in the heavy-seed scenario) of them are above the detectability threshold solely due to strong lensing effects and would otherwise be undetectable. For detectable pairs of strong-lensed events by galaxy lenses, we also find between 72%-81% of them to have time delays from 1 week to 1 year.

 - **Abstract**
 Scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) open a unique window into early-universe physics. While their generation from adiabatic perturbations has been extensively studied, the contribution from isocurvature perturbations remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a lattice simulation framework to compute the stochastic gravitational wave background from both pure isocurvature and mixed initial conditions. Our numerical results show excellent agreement with semi-analytical predictions in the pure isocurvature case. We further analyze multi-peak structures under general initial conditions and find that they closely match those produced in purely adiabatic scenarios. Additionally, we examine SIGWs in early matter-dominated eras, revealing that the peak amplitude and spectral slope are sensitive to the microphysical properties of the dominant field, such as the primordial black hole mass, abundance, or soliton decay rate. This study establishes lattice simulations as a robust tool for predicting SIGW spectra from complex primordial perturbations, with important implications for interpreting current and future gravitational wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Supermassive black hole binary systems (SMBHBs) are thought to emit the recently discovered nHz gravitational wave background; however, not a single individual nHz source has been confirmed to date. Long-term radio-monitoring at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory has revealed two potential SMBHB candidates: blazars PKS 2131-021 and PKS J0805-0111. These sources show periodic flux density variations across the electromagnetic spectrum, signaling the presence of a good clock. To explain the emission, we propose a generalizable jet model, where a mildly relativistic wind creates an outward-moving helical channel, along which the ultra-relativistic jet propagates. The observed flux variation from the jet is mostly due to aberration. The emission at lower frequency arises at larger radius and its variation is consequently delayed, as observed. Our model reproduces the main observable features of both sources and can be applied to other sources as they are discovered. We make predictions for radio polarization, direct imaging, and emission line variation, which can be tested with forthcoming observations. Our results motivate future numerical simulations of jetted SMBHB systems and have implications for the fueling, structure, and evolution of blazar jets.

 - **Abstract**
 The deflection of light rays near gravitating objects can be influenced not only by gravity itself but also by the surrounding medium. Analytical studies of such effects are possible within the geometrical optics approximation, where the medium introduces additional light bending due to refraction. These studies typically assume a cold non-magnetized plasma, for which light propagation is independent of the medium's velocity. In this paper, we extend the analysis to the general case of dispersive refractive media in motion and study its influence on light deflection. We consider an axially symmetric stationary spacetime filled with a moving medium, motivated by the interplay between rotational effects originating from the spacetime and those induced by the medium's motion. We begin by analyzing light deflection in the equatorial plane of a rotating object in the presence of a radially moving and rotating medium. Assuming a specific form of the refractive index enables a fully analytic treatment. In the particular cases of either pure radial or pure rotational motion, we obtain explicit expressions for the deflection angle. Next, we analyze the case of a slowly moving medium and identify two particularly interesting results. First, we show that, to the first order in the medium's velocity, the radial motion does not affect the light deflection. Second, assuming slow rotation of the gravitating object, we demonstrate that the black hole rotation and the medium motion can produce equivalent observational signatures. We find the quantitative condition under which these effects compensate each other. This relation becomes particularly clear for a Kerr black hole, discussed as an example.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate electromagnetic and Dirac field axial-perturbations of a charged regular black hole arising from quantum gravity effects, commonly referred to as the Frolov black hole, a regular (nonsingular) black hole solution. We derive the master wave equations for massless electromagnetic and Dirac perturbations and solve them using the standard Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method along with Padé approximation. From these solutions, we extract the dominant and overtone quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies along with the associated grey-body factors, highlighting the deviations introduced by quantum gravity corrections compared to the classical case of Reissner-Nordström black hole. Furthermore, we analyze the Unruh-Verlinde temperature of this spacetime, providing quantitative estimates of how quantum gravity effects influence both quasinormal ringing and particle emission in nonsingular black hole models.

 - **Abstract**
 The Weyl double copy formalism, which relates the Weyl spinor with the square of the field strength, is studied in the context of Hassan-Rosen bigravity for stationary and time-dependent solutions. We consider the dyonic Kerr-Newman-(A)dS solution and the Plebański-Demiański metric in the context of bigravity. These solutions are studied in the Weyl double copy both with matter independently coupled and show that no massive modes are present in the Weyl spinor. The equations of motion for the gauge and scalar fields are those of Maxwell equations coupled to an external source, and massless Klein-Gordon equations with a conformal curvature term and an external source, all of them consistent with general relativity. For wave solutions, massive modes are manifest in the Weyl spinor and a formulation in bigravity for these massive modes is proposed. The resulting equations of motion are Proca equations with a conformal term and massive Klein-Gordon equations. In the case of the matter contributions for waves, we show how the resonance mass is present in equations of motion of the fields obtained from the Weyl double copy. The solutions studied are written in a Kerr-Schild form, connecting with the Kerr-Schild double copy.

 - **Abstract**
 We prove a coordinate- and foliation-independent Heisenberg-type lower bound for quantum states strictly localized in geodesic balls of radius $r$ on spacelike hypersurfaces of arbitrary spacetimes (with matter and a cosmological constant). The estimate depends only on the induced Riemannian geometry of the slice; it is independent of the lapse, shift, and extrinsic curvature, and controls the canonical momentum variance/uncertainty $\sigma_p$ by the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator (Theorem). On weakly mean-convex balls we obtain the universal product inequality $\sigma_p\,r \ge \hbar/2$, whose constant is optimal and never attained (Corollary). This result abstracts and extends the framework recently introduced for black-hole slices in [10].

 - **Abstract**
 Global monopoles are topological defects predicted by certain grand unified theories and have been extensively studied for their astrophysical and cosmological implications, including their distinctive spacetime geometry and characteristic gravitational lensing effects. Despite this interest, an exact solution for a global monopole remains elusive, with research largely confined to approximations of the static, spherically symmetric case. This paper addresses the fundamental question of whether a rotating global monopole can exist as a solution to the coupled Einstein-scalar field equations. We first prove that metrics generated by applying the Newman-Janis algorithm to the static monopole are inconsistent with the scalar field's equation of motion. Furthermore, we perform an asymptotic analysis for general static, axially symmetric spacetimes and establish that the only such solution that is regular at large distances is the spherically symmetric one. These results lead to the definitive conclusion that non-trivial, rotating global monopole solutions are forbidden within the framework of Einstein's general relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss photon rings around as well as shadows of Kerr black holes immersed in a swirling spacetime. We find that the spin-spin interaction between the angular momentum of the black hole and the swirling of the background leads to new interesting effects as it breaks the symmetry between the upper and lower hemispheres. One of the new features of the spin-spin interaction is the existence of up to three light rings for suitable choices of the angular momentum parameter $a$ and swirling parameter $j$. In comparison to the Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a swirling universe, the light rings typically all possess different radii.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct perturbations of Minkowski spacetime in general relativity, when given initial data that decays inverse polynomially to initial data of a Kerr spacetime towards spacelike infinity. We show that the perturbations admit a regular conformal compactification at null and timelike infinity, where the degree of regularity increases linearly with the rate of decay of the initial data to Kerr initial data. In particular, the compactification is smooth if the initial data decays rapidly to Kerr initial data. This generalizes results of Friedrich, who constructed spacetimes with a smooth conformal compactification in the case when the initial data is identical to Kerr initial data on the complement of a compact set. Our results rely on a novel formulation of the Einstein equations about Minkowski spacetime introduced by the author, that allows one to formulate the dynamic problem as a quasilinear, symmetric hyperbolic PDE that is regular at null infinity and with null infinity being at a fixed locus. It is not regular at spacelike infinity, due to the asymptotics of Kerr. Thus the main technical task is the construction of solutions near spacelike infinity, using tailored energy estimates. To accomplish this, we organize the equations according to homogeneity with respect to scaling about spacelike infinity, which identifies terms that are leading, respectively lower order, near spacelike infinity, with contributions from Kerr being lower order.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the threshold to form a black hole, in an asymptotically flat and radiation dominated Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe, is not solely (mainly) determined by the behaviour of the compaction function at its maximum, as earlier thought, but also by the three-dimensional curvature at smaller (but super-horizon) scales, which we call "the core". We find three classes of initial conditions characterized by an open (O), closed (C), or flat (F) FRW core surrounded by a shell with higher three-dimensional curvature. In the C case, the core helps the collapse so that the black hole formation threshold is there the lowest among all cases. Type-II black holes might only be generated by Type-O or F (each of those with different thresholds, with O being the highest) or by a Type-C with an effective F core. Finally, we argue that an F core is typically more probable for a sharp power spectrum, however, it is also more likely related to non-spherical initial conditions. On the other hand, a very broad power spectrum, which might be related to the observed NanoGrav signal, would favor the formation of Type-I black holes with a mass spectrum peaked at the Infra-Red scale.

#### QNM families: classification and competition

 - **Abstract**
 The perturbation spectra of black hole (BH) beyond standard general relativity (GR) may exhibit complex structures with long-lived modes that generate echo-like modulations on the ringdown signal. However, a systematic framework for understanding the internal structure of such spectra, the physical nature of different mode families, and their dynamical excitation is still undeveloped. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a potential methodology that combines frequency-domain classification with time-domain analysis, using a hairy Schwarzschild BH that admits a double-peak perturbative potential as a theoretical platform. Our analysis of the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum identifies two distinct families of modes: the photon sphere (PS) family, arising from delocalized scattering resonances, and the echo family, corresponding to highly localized quasi-bound states. We then develop a windowed energy analysis framework in the time domain, which discloses a dynamic competition for dominance between these families. In particular, our results explicitly show that this competition is sensitive to the properties of the initial perturbation source, and that higher-overtone echo modes can dominate in the observed signal, which are in contrast to the standard PS mode in GR. This study establishes the dynamic evolution of this energy competition as a new observational signature for probing new physics and further motivate a supplemental framework for analyzing long-lived ringdown signals.

 - **Abstract**
 BTZ spacetime is a long-known locally AdS solution to the Einstein equations in 1 timelike and 2 spacelike dimensions. Its static variant is interpreted as a black hole whose mass is related to the period of the angular coordinate. This solution can be parametrically continued into one without horizons but with a conical deficit in the center. Such a solution is interpreted as a spacetime with a massive particle. It has been shown that this particle can be in static equilibrium with a cosmic string passing through the spacetime to infinity. In this work, we explore the interaction of point particles with strings, such as a bound system of two particles connected by a string of finite length. We identify additive local mass in the static spacetimes and apply it to the case of particles and strings. Finally, using the cut and glue method, we construct the system of two particles oscillating on the string, which goes out of the scope of static systems.

 - **Abstract**
 The stochastic gravitational-wave background from compact binary coalescences is expected to be the first detectable stochastic signal via cross-correlation searches with terrestrial detectors. It encodes the cumulative merger history of stellar-mass binaries across cosmic time, offering a unique probe of the high-redshift Universe. However, predicting the background spectrum is challenging due to numerous modeling choices, each with distinct uncertainties. In this work, we present a comprehensive forecast of the astrophysical gravitational-wave background from binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole systems. We systematically assess the impact of uncertainties in population properties, waveform features, and the modeling of the merger rate evolution. By combining all uncertainties, we derive credible bands for the background spectrum, spanning approximately an order of magnitude in the fractional energy density. These results provide thorough predictions to facilitate the interpretation of current upper limits and future detections.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit thermodynamics of five-dimensional AdS spacetime at finite temperature and rotation using the Euclidean path integral. It is generally believed that at low temperatures and finite rotation, the bulk saddle point that governs the thermodynamics describes a rotating gas of thermal radiation. Consequently, the dual gauge theory at low temperatures is in a confined thermal state. We demonstrate that this holographic expectation is at odds with the fact that, even at low temperatures, there exist saddles of the bulk path integral with real part of on-shell action smaller than that of the thermal rotating gas. The usual Kerr-AdS black holes but with complex parameters are examples of such saddles. Using mini-superspace ideas and steepest descent, we argue that these additional saddles do not actually feature in the low temperature partition function. This saves the original claim that rotating thermal gas is indeed the correct background for understanding the dual gauge theory at low temperatures. As a corollary, we also find that the unstable small rotating black hole does not contribute to the partition function at any temperature, even in a suppressed manner.

#### Are $S^1\times S^2$ wormholes generic with large sources?

 - **Abstract**
 Euclidean path integrals can be used to prepare states of a Lorentzian QFT. So long as any sources are turned off on the $t=0$ surface, the resulting Lorentzian states all belong to the same Hilbert space. Constructing more states than allowed by the Lorentzian density of states means that the resulting states must be linearly dependent. For large amplitude sources and a fixed cutoff on energy, the AdS bulk dual of this effect has been conjectured to be captured by spacetime wormholes. Wormholes should then be generic in the presence of large such Euclidean sources. This hypothesis can be studied in a context with asymptotically locally AdS$_4$ boundaries of topology $S^1 \times S^2$ in which the wormhole is supported by a source for minimally-coupled massless bulk scalars. In preparation for a later more complete study, we consider here a preliminary toy version of the model in which the spacetimes are cohomogeneity-1, but with the consequence that the sources do not vanish at $t=0$. We then find that generic sources at large masses do {\it not} lead to wormholes. Along the way we map out the phase diagram for wormhole, thermal AdS, and black hole phases of our cohomogeneity-1 ansatz. We also numerically evaluate their stability by identifying negative modes. In parallel with the previously-studied case of $S^3$ boundaries, the results are analogous to those associated with the familiar Hawking-Page transition.

 - **Abstract**
 Scalar fields in theories of gravity often inhabit a moduli space of vacua, and coherent spatial or temporal variations in their expectation values can produce measurable gravitational effects. Such variations are expected in contexts ranging from inflationary cosmology to the near-horizon regions of near-extremal black holes, where they can deflect light rays and shift horizons. This work derives a quantitative field excursion bound (FEB) on scalar variations along null geodesics, expressed in terms of the expansion parameter. The bound follows from the Raychaudhuri equation, assuming that all other fields satisfy the null energy condition (NEC). It is saturated in certain spacetimes containing a timelike naked singularity. A possible generalization to semiclassical spacetimes that violate the NEC, but satisfy a strengthened version of the quantum focusing condition (QFC), is proposed. In cosmology, the FEB constrains the extent of large field excursions to be linearly bounded by the number of e-folds, independent of the inflationary model. This has notable implications for anthropic scenarios, where large excursions are often invoked to access favorable vacua.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the solution-generating technique based on the Breitenlohner-Maison (BM) linear system, for asymptotically flat, stationary, bi-axisymmetric black hole solutions with various horizon topologies in five-dimensional vacuum Einstein theory. We construct the monodromy matrix associated with the BM linear system, which provides a unified framework for describing three distinct asymptotically flat, vacuum black hole solutions with a single angular momentum in five dimensions, each with a different horizon topology: (i) the singly rotating Myers-Perry black hole, (ii) the Emparan-Reall black ring, and (iii) the Chen-Teo rotating black lens. Conversely, by solving the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem using the procedure developed by Katsimpouri et al., we demonstrate that factorization of the monodromy matrix exactly reproduces these vacuum solutions, thereby reconstructing the three geometries. These constitute the first explicit examples in which the factorization procedure has been carried out for black holes with non-spherical horizon topologies. In addition, we discuss how the asymptotic behavior of five-dimensional vacuum solutions at spatial infinity is reflected in the asymptotic structure of the monodromy matrix in the spectral parameter space.
