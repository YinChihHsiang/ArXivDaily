 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts pose challenges to standard seeding mechanisms. Among competing models, the collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos provide a plausible explanation for early SMBH formation. While previous studies on modeling the gravothermal collapse of SIDM halos have primarily focused on non-relativistic evolution under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, We advance this framework by relaxing the equilibrium assumption and additionally incorporating general-relativistic effects. To this end, we introduce the Misner-Sharp formalism to the SIDM context for the first time. Our model reproduces the standard hydrostatic models in the early long-mean-free-path (LMFP) regime, but displays interesting distinct behavior in the late short-mean-free-path (SMFP) regime, where intense outward heat flux drives a rapid expansion of the outer envelope, removing mass from the core and significantly decelerating the collapse. Our general relativistic treatment enables us to follow halo evolution to the final stage when the apparent horizon forms. Our simulation yields a seed black hole mass of approximately $3\times10^{-8}$ of the halo mass at horizon formation, suggesting that additional mechanisms such as baryonic effects are critical for seeding black holes that are sufficiently massive to account for SMBHs in the early Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We present constraints on quintessence dark energy models using the observational detection of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)--thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) cross-correlation dataset. Our analysis compares three classes of quintessence dynamics: thawing, tracker, and scaling-freezing with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Through a comprehensive likelihood analysis, we derive best-fit values and 68\% confidence intervals for key cosmological parameters, finding $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.322^{+0.027}_{-0.030}$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.735^{+0.045}_{-0.035}$ for $\Lambda$CDM, with deviations in alternative models consistent within $1\sigma$. For the thawing model, we consider an exponential potential with slope $\lambda = 0.736^{+0.270}_{-0.227}$, while for the tracker and scaling-freezing models, we use inverse axion-like and double exponential potentials, respectively. Observationally, the tracker model yields $n = 5.651^{+1.625}_{-1.604}$ and $f = 0.258^{+0.149}_{-0.096}$, and the scaling-freezing model gives $\lambda_1 = 0.405^{+0.293}_{-0.322}$ and $\lambda_2 = 23.226^{+7.975}_{-7.258}$. The dimensionless tSZ amplitude ($\widetilde{W}^{\rm SZ}$) and cosmic infrared background (CIB) parameters are tightly constrained across all models, providing additional insights into astrophysical foregrounds. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of ISW--tSZ cross-correlations as a probe of dark energy dynamics, with the Thawing quintessence model yielding the lowest $\chi^2_{\rm min}$ among the tested scenarios, and highlight the need for future high-precision measurements to distinguish between quintessence models and $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite its proximity, the mass of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the spiral galaxy M81 (NGC~3031) has remained uncertain, with previous dynamical measurements being unreliable. We present the first robust stellar-dynamical measurement of its mass using high-resolution, two-dimensional kinematics from JWST/NIRSpec observations of the central $3''\times3''$. By tracing stellar motions in the near-infrared, our data penetrate the obscuring nuclear dust and allow for the separation of stellar light from the non-thermal AGN continuum. We modeled the kinematics using JAM within a Bayesian framework, exploring a comprehensive suite of models that systematically account for uncertainties in the point-spread function, orbital anisotropy, and stellar mass-to-light ratio. This ensemble modeling approach demonstrates that a central dark mass unambiguously drives the central rise in velocity dispersion. The models yield a robust SMBH mass of $M_{\rm BH} = (4.78^{+0.07}_{-0.10})\times10^7$ M$_\odot$. This result resolves a long-standing uncertainty in the mass of M81's black hole and provides a crucial, reliable anchor point for SMBH-galaxy scaling relations.

#### Forecasting the E_G measurements from the photometric and spectroscopic surveys of Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST)

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.17874

 - **Abstract**
 We present forecasts for the $E_G$ statistic using redshift distributions of realistic mock galaxy samples from the upcoming Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). The dominant uncertainty in $E_G$ stems from the redshift space distortion parameter ${\beta}$, whose precision limits the overall constraining power. Our analysis shows that CSST will nevertheless achieve $E_G$ constraints at the few-percent level (3%-9%) over $0 < z < 1.2$, an improvement by a factor of several to an order of magnitude over current observations. Within the $\mu-\Sigma$ modified gravity framework, the parameter $\Sigma_0$, associated with the effective gravitational constant of the Weyl potential, can be constrained to $\sim 5\%$ precision. In a plausible scenario where upcoming spectroscopic surveys determine ${\beta}$ to 1\% accuracy, $E_G$ constraints tighten to the percent level, and $\Sigma_0$ becomes measurable at $\sim 1\%$. These results demonstrate that CSST will serve as a powerful facility for testing gravity and underscore the essential synergy between photometric weak lensing and spectroscopic surveys in probing cosmic acceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 With increasing sensitivity of the gravitational wave (GW) detectors, we expect a significant rise in the detectable GW events. To process, analyse and identify such large amounts of GW signals arising from mergers of Binary Black Holes (BBH), we need both speed and accuracy. In the search for (massive) BBH signals, the biggest hurdle is posed by the various non-gaussian noise transients called glitches. Compared to our previous work, which used a simple convolutional neural network to distinguish BBHs from Blip glitches, this work uses transfer learning with InceptionNetV3 to distinguish BBHs from six types of most popular glitches from the third observing run of LIGO. While the glitches are real and identified via GravitySpy, the BBH signals are simulated and then injected into the real detector noise for each of the two LIGO detectors. We generate Sine-Gaussian Projection (SGP) maps by cross-correlating data with Sine-Gaussian functions of varied quality factors ($Q$) and central frequencies ($f_0$) and projected on the $Q$ - $f_0$ plane. We find that SGP maps make it easier to distinguish BBHs from glitches that look very similar to BBHs in the Time-Frequency maps like the Blips, while also maintaining significant morphological differences between BBHs and the more frequent glitches - Scattered Light and Fast Scattering. Our network has an accuracy of $87%$, a TPR of 0.83 for an FPR of 0.1 on our test dataset. It is also robust, retaining its level of accuracy, when tested on real BBH events identified in the first three observing runs of LIGO. Our proposed method shows the viability of using the SGP maps and neural networks for fast identification of GW events improving the efficiency of standard search pipelines.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform the classification of black hole and neutron star X-ray binary systems using deep neural networks applied to archival RXTE X-ray spectral data. We first construct two neural network models: one trained using only spectral flux values and another trained using both fluxes and their associated errors. Both models achieve high classification accuracies of ~90-94 %. To gain physical interpretability of these networks, we fit all spectra with a simple phenomenological model consisting of a thermal disk component and a power-law. From this analysis, we identify the blackbody temperature, power-law index, the ratio of blackbody to power-law flux, the reduced $\chi^2$, and the variance of the data as key parameters that likely contribute to the classification. We validate this inference by designing an additional neural network trained exclusively on this reduced parameter set, without using the spectral data directly. This parameter-based model achieves a classification accuracy comparable to that of the spectral models. Our results show that deep neural networks can not only classify compact objects in X-ray binaries with high accuracy but can also be interpreted in terms of physically meaningful spectral parameters derived from conventional X-ray spectral analysis. This framework offers a promising, mission-agnostic approach for compact object classification in current and future X-ray surveys.

#### The Most Luminous H$β$ Reverberation Mapping of E1821+643 Indicates the Lower Boundary of the Radius-Luminosity Relation

 - **Abstract**
 The radius-luminosity ($R_{\rm BLR}$-$L_{5100}$) relation is fundamental to active galactic nucleus (AGN) studies, enabling supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass estimates and AGN-based cosmology applications. However, its high-luminosity end remains poorly calibrated due to insufficient reliable reverberation mapping (RM) data. We present a four-year RM campaign of the luminous quasar E1821+643 using the Lijiang 2.4-m telescope, supplemented by archival multi-wavelength data. E1821+643 is the most luminous AGN with an \hb\ RM measurement to date. The measured time lag of $83.2_{-18.7}^{+17.5}$ days is a factor of 5.6 shorter than predicted by the canonical $R_{\rm BLR}$-$L_{5100}$ relation. By compiling the full \hb\ RM sample, we find that such deviation defines a lower envelope ($0.2R_{\rm BLR}$) of measured lags across the entire luminosity range, while the upper envelope lies near $2R_{\rm BLR}$, implying that the scatter for individual AGNs can reach 1 dex. Spectral decomposition reveals two distinct \hb\ components: a core component with a lag of $267.0_{-17.6}^{+16.6}$ days closer to the $R_{\rm BLR}$-$L_{5100}$ relation, and a redshifted tail with a much shorter lag of $-49.0_{-34.5}^{+50.5}$ days. The short-lag component not only accounts for the significantly shortened overall lag, but also leads to an opposite interpretation of the intrinsic BLR kinematics. These effects can introduce systematic uncertainties in black hole mass estimates by factors of up to tens. Our findings demonstrate that shortened lags in high-accretion-rate AGNs arise from multi-component BLR structures, posing substantial challenges to single-epoch mass estimates and impacting SMBH demographics and cosmological applications.

#### Multi-epoch VLBI observations of the blazar 3C 66A: Spatial twisting and temporal oscillation of the parsec-scale jet

 - **Abstract**
 Previous VLBI kinematic studies of the blazar 3C 66A have unveiled complex jet kinematic behaviors. Using follow-up high-resolution VLBI observations and archival data, we investigate the morphology and the variations in orientation and core flux density of the 3C 66A jet to gain a deeper insights into its kinematic behavior and physical origins. We performed KVN and VERA array (KaVA) observations at 22/43 GHz over three epochs in 2014 and collected 109 sets of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) archival data at 43 GHz between 1996 - 2025. We imaged the parsec-scale jet and parameterized it using circular Gaussian fittings to the UV visibilities. Finally, we derived the inner jet PA and the core flux densities for the VLBA data. The jet presents a twisted morphology in the KaVA maps. The PA of the fitted Gaussian components is in the range between 170 deg and 195 deg. Our kinematic analysis using the VLBA data indicates that the PA oscillates with an amplitude of 7.77 pm 0.79 deg and a period of 10.94 pm 0.22 years, presented for the first time in this work. This oscillation is topped by a continuous clockwise shift of the PA by -0.83 pm 0.07 deg/year. We also identified a strong core flux variability with possible periodicity and a 2 sigma correlation between the core flux density and the inner jet PA change. We discuss possible physical models that could explain the observed features for this object; in particular, a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) system, Lense Thirring (LT) effect, and jet or disk instabilities. The oscillation and continuous shift of the PA and the possible radio flux periodicity, together with the optical flux periodicity of approximately 2 years that had previously been confirmed in several independent studies, favor a jet precession scenario driven by orbital motion and disk-orbit misalignment in a SMBHB system.

#### Disk-jet-wind coupling from stellar mass to supermassive black holes

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes are the simplest possible objects, characterised by only mass and spin. We see them via accretion, so there is one more fundamental parameter which is the mass accretion rate. Here I will review how the data from both stellar and supermassive black holes can be fit into a framework where there is a major spectral transition at $\dot{m}=L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$ where the optically thick disc is replaced by a hot flow. This dramatic spectral change also affects the expected properties of thermal and radiatively powered winds, matching the overall properties of winds seen in new XRISM data from the stellar mass binaries, though there can also be additional UV and dust driven winds in supermassive black holes. The radio data in stellar and supermassive black holes are clear that the hot flow (not the disc) connects to the radio jet, and the radio-X-ray 'fundamental plane' can be qualitatively understood if the radio quiet AGN and stellar mass black holes have low to moderate spins, with the jet power set as a constant fraction of the accretion power. A small fraction of AGN (radio loud) instead have much higher (factor $100-1000\times$) radio-to-X-ray ratio at the same black hole mass and mass accretion rates. I speculate that these have higher jet power due to high black hole spin. I review the multiple issues still remaining in this picture, most of which are connected to the geometry and nature of the X-ray corona, and the conflicting constraints on this which come from reflection spectroscopy and polarimetry.

#### Ultra-fast growth of primordial black holes through radiative absorption

 - **Abstract**
 We show that Schwarzschild primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the radiation-dominated era can grow extremely rapidly through $\textit{radiative absorption}$ governed by the full Stefan-Boltzmann law. By introducing a principle of isonomy - ensuring identical particle species dependence for Hawking emission and absorption - we find that, whenever the temperature of the PBH environment is larger than the PBH horizon temperature, PBHs generically gain mass. In particular, for PBH masses following the critical collapse mass-scaling law with critical exponent $\gamma_\mathrm{crit}$, with $\gamma_\mathrm{crit} \in (0.33, 0.49)$, the aforementioned radiative absorption mass growth mechanism produces a striking effect: PBHs forming with a mass $10^6M_\odot$ during BBN can reach $\mathcal{O}(10^{10} M_\odot)$ within $\mathcal{O}(10^{6} \mathrm{s})$ ($\sim $ 58 days). Interestingly enough, small deviations from $\gamma_\mathrm{crit}$, depending itself on the number of relativistic species present in the primordial plasma, yield a continuous PBH mass spectrum providing us ultimately with a single, Standard-Model-based explanation for the origin of stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black holes (SMBHs), and naturally accounting for the early appearance of SMBHs. The Schwarzschild treatment presented here can be extended to spherically symmetric cosmological black holes, indicating that radiative absorption is a dominant and previously overlooked PBH growth channel in the early Universe.

#### Radial Integral Reformulation of the Gauss-Bonnet Weak Deflection Angle at Finite Distance

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a radial integral reformulation of finite distance gravitational lensing in optical geometry for static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. Starting from the Gauss-Bonnet characterization of the finite distance deflection angle, we adopt the Li-type curvature primitive identity [this https URL] [2006.13047], which reduces the curvature-area contribution to a one-dimensional integral evaluated along the physical light ray. We then remove the remaining implicit orbit dependence by an explicit change of variables using the null first integrals, converting the Li line integral from $\phi$-integration to $r$-integration and splitting the trajectory at the turning point (closest approach). The resulting formula expresses the deflection angle as a sum of two radial integrals over $[r_0,r_S]$ and $[r_0,r_R]$ plus the finite distance angular bookkeeping term, with a transparent normalization/cancellation structure for the curvature primitive. In Schwarzschild gauge, we provide a weak-field evaluation toolkit that reduces the computation to reusable families of standard radial integrals and gives compact expressions for the endpoint incidence angles in the optical metric. Worked examples include Schwarzschild and Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) spacetimes and a black hole immersed in perfect-fluid dark matter with a finite halo. For the finite-halo model we derive closed-form leading weak-deflection expressions for mixed endpoint configurations (source/receiver inside or outside the halo), illustrating the modularity of the radial Gauss-Bonnet pipeline.

#### Quasi-homogeneous geometrothermodynamics of a noncommutative Reissner-Nordstrom black hole

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.17081

 - **Abstract**
 We present the thermodynamic properties of a noncommutative Reissner Nordstrom (NCRN) black hole (BH) modeled with Lorentzian distributions. The analysis is carried out using a Legendre invariant formalism called Geometrothermodynamics (GTD) which is applied to a quasihomogeneous system generated by the NCRN BH. This formalism enables the study of phase transitions by locating Ricci scalar singularities, from which the phase transition points are determined in terms of the thermodynamic variables. We also examine how the noncommutative (NC) parameter can be interpreted as a thermodynamic variable within quasi-homogeneous thermodynamic laws, highlighting its potential role on phase transitions beyond those well-known characterized by divergences in the heat capacity.

#### Varying Newton constant, entropy and the black hole evaporation law

 - **Abstract**
 In Einstein equations we represent the energy-momentum tensor as the one ($T^{\mu\nu}$ ) of an ideal fluid plus the cosmological term. We consider time-dependent Newton ``constant" $G$, the cosmological term $\Lambda$ and non-conserved $T^{\mu\nu}$. The Bianchi identity imposes a relation between the energy-momentum (non)conservation and the variation of $G$ and $\Lambda$. If the energy-momentum $T^{\mu\nu}$ is conserved then both the Newton ``constant" $G$ and the cosmological term $\Lambda $ either do not change or both must depend on time. If the energy-momentum $T^{\mu\nu}$ is not conserved then the Bianchi identity implies a relation between the energy-momentum and a variation in time of either $G$ or $\Lambda$ (or both). We apply thermodynamics in order to express the non-conservation of the energy-momentum of an ideal fluid by entropy and relate the time variations of $G$ and $\Lambda$ to a change of entropy. Using the relation between a varying Newton constant G and the black hole entropy we derive a modified formula for the Schwarzschild black hole evaporation (a slower evaporation). Its life time is $\frac{9}{5}$ times larger than the one for a constant $G$. The average black hole's density remains constant when the black hole's radius shrinks to zero .

#### Dissipative Unimodular Gravity: Linking Energy Diffusion to Bulk Viscosity as an Alternative to $Λ$CDM under DESI DR2 Data

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17281

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.17281

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explore a theoretical and observational study of the presence of viscosity in the Unimodular Gravity formalism, a pioneering approach that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously explored in this context. Specifically, we study a flat FLRW universe at late times, where matter experiences dissipative processes in the form of a bulk viscosity, in the framework of Eckart's theory, which is linked to the energy diffusion function $Q$ through the power law $\xi=\xi_{0}\left|Q\right|^{1/2}$, being $\xi_{0}$ a positive dimensionless parameter. By assuming the ansatz $Q=\nu H^{2}$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $\nu$ is a dimensionless arbitrary constant, we find analytical solutions for the cosmological evolution. We test these models against the most recent cosmological observations, including type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, cosmic chronometers, gravitational lensing, and black hole shadow data. Our results show that two of the tested models provide a significantly better fit to the data ($\chi_{\text{min}}^{2}$) and remain as competitive as $\Lambda$CDM model according to the Bayesian Information Criterion. These findings, combined with the inherent ability of Unimodular Gravity to alleviate the cosmological constant problem, position dissipative UG as a robust and compelling alternative to the standard model, potentially suggesting that a very small but nontrivial energy nonconservation is compatible with the late-time observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 Induced gravity, defined as a globally scale-invariant ``first-generation'' scalar-tensor theory, is investigated within the framework of the thermodynamics of modified gravity theories. The ``temperature of gravity'' and its evolution equation are derived for this model, and the resulting expressions are used to analyse General-Relativity equilibrium states and to investigate the possible existence of an attractor mechanism toward Einstein's theory with a cosmological constant.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by quantum-gravity scenarios that replace the classical black hole singularity with a regular core, and by the possibility that the dark-energy sector may be scale dependent, we construct a broad class of nonsingular rotating black-hole spacetimes embedded in an improved de Sitter--like background with either constant or running $\Lambda$. Because the Newman--Janis algorithm is generically incompatible with a cosmological-constant fluid, we instead propose a generalized Kerr--Schild construction on a (possibly scale-dependent $\Lambda$) de Sitter seed, yielding a Carter-type metric characterized by a mass function and a $\Lambda$ function. Our construction provides a direct map from static, spherically symmetric regular models to their rotating counterparts. We derive sharp regularity conditions at the ring and we identify a minimal-order subclass. We analyze chronology and show that, for non-negative mass function and $\Lambda$ above a certain negative limit, the spacetimes are stably causal. For minimal-order geometries with non-negative mass, we prove that the weak energy condition must be violated. Finally, we illustrate the framework with an asymptotic-safety--inspired model and discuss horizon structure, surface gravities, and conformal diagrams. These results provide a controlled, observationally oriented arena to confront regular rotating black holes in dark-energy backgrounds with the rapidly improving gravitational-wave and horizon-scale imaging data.

#### From Thermodynamic Criticality to Geometric Criticality: A Linear Kernel Map from Matter Susceptibilities to Black-Hole Shadows

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.17613

 - **Abstract**
 We construct an explicit linear map from compact, conserved thermodynamic/effective-medium perturbations of the stress-energy tensor to the metric response in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, and from there to geometric observables of direct relevance to horizon-scale imaging: the shadow radius and photon-sphere frequency. The response is expressed through $L^{1}$-bounded kernels written in a piecewise "local $+$ tail" form, which makes transparent the separation between near-photon-sphere sensitivity and far-zone contributions (including AdS tails). Under mild assumptions on the matter susceptibilities near a critical point, dominated convergence transfers the thermodynamic exponent to the geometric susceptibility, $\gamma_{\rm sh}=\gamma_{\rm th}$, with controlled analytic corrections. We further provide AdS far-zone bounds with explicit outside-support constants depending only on background geometric data at the photon sphere and shell geometry. A reproducible numerical pipeline with convergence diagnostics is presented and benchmarked.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study the phase of neutrino oscillation propagating along radial and non-radial paths in the Einstein$\text{-}$Hilbert$\text{-}$Bumblebee (EHB) gravity around global monopole field, by using the quantummechanical treatment, the expression of the corrected neutrino of probability of oscillation is obtained. Our results show that neutrino oscillation in the EHB gravity around global monopole field is different from that in Schwarzschild black hole, the Lorentz-violating parameter $a$ mainly affects the peak of the oscillation probability, and the global monopole $\overline { \mu }$ and the lightest neutrino mass both affect the frequency of the oscillations of probabilities, which means that studying the neutrino oscillation phenomenon in curved spacetime may not only become a new technology for probing the properties of compact celestial bodies, but also help deepen our understanding of neutrinos.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the existence of black bounce solutions in $2+1$ dimensions within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity. We analyze whether black bounce geometries originally obtained in general relativity can be consistently generalized to $f(R)$ theories and identify the matter sources capable of supporting such solutions. We also construct a new class of solutions by imposing a vanishing curvature scalar. In the matter sector, we consider models involving a coupling between a scalar field and nonlinear electrodynamics, while in the gravitational sector we analyze both the Starobinsky model and more general forms of $f(R)$. We further examine the viability conditions of the $f(R)$ models that give rise to these spacetimes, including the behavior of the scalaron mass. Finally, we study the associated energy conditions, in order to assess the degree of exoticity of the matter content required to sustain these black bounce solutions and how the $f(R)$ theory modifies the energy conditions.

 - **Abstract**
 We establish, for the first time, an exact correspondence between Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theory and gauged Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein models in (3+1) dimensions. By constructing the simplest consistent ansatz within the gauged Skyrme-Maxwell framework, we reveal a remarkable equivalence in a sector that admits nonvanishing, highly magnetized baryonic charge. This correspondence has a particularly appealing consequence: it transfers the full power of solution-generating techniques developed for electrovacuum systems-many of which naturally accommodate scalar fields to the considerably more intricate setting of gauged Skyrme-Maxwell theory minimally coupled to General Relativity. As a result, it opens the door to a systematic and much broader exploration of exact solutions in Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein theory and of their potential applications in cosmology and astrophysics. Notably, the resulting configurations carry nonzero baryonic charge whenever the derivative of the hadronic profile along the magnetic field lines does not vanish. As an illustrative example, we apply this new dictionary to a rotating Kerr-Newman-like spacetime dressed with a scalar field. In the corresponding Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein solution, the quantization of the baryonic charge enforces a quantization of the Kerr rotation parameter. We derive an upper bound on the baryonic charge in terms of the integration constants of the solution and show that, in the regime of small baryonic charge, the rotation parameter depends linearly on the baryonic charge.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent cosmological observations, most notably from the DESI Data Release 2 (DR2) \cite{DESIDR2}, suggest a potential redshift evolution of the dark energy equation of state, reviving fundamental questions regarding the physical viability of the phantom regime ($w < -1$). In this Letter, a no-go result is established for a broad class of single-field effective scalar cosmologies where the kinetic response is modulated by the Hubble expansion rate, a structural feature characteristic of infrared-modified and nonlocal gravity theories \cite{DeserWoodard2007, Maggiore2014}. It is proved that imposing ghost freedom, defined by the positivity of the kinetic response function $\mathcal{M} \equiv \partial\rho/\partial X > 0$, enforces the phantom divide ($w = -1$) as a \textit{stability-protected boundary} in the cosmological phase space. While the equation of state can approach this limit arbitrarily closely, continuous ghost-free evolution into the phantom regime is shown to be strictly forbidden. The dynamics are found to converge toward a de~Sitter-like attractor where $w \to -1$ emerges as a consequence of dynamical selection and stability rather than the fine-tuning of the scalar potential. These results suggest that the "hints" of evolution observed in DESI DR2 may reflect the underlying stability requirements of the effective field theory, providing a theoretical mechanism that prevents a physical transition into the phantom phase.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate quasinormal modes, late-time tails, and grey-body factors for massive scalar perturbations in the background of the Dymnikova regular black hole. By applying both the time-domain integration and the WKB method with Padé improvements, we show that the spectrum of massive fields differs qualitatively from the massless case. The oscillation frequency of the dominant mode grows with the field mass $\mu$, while the damping rate decreases, suggesting the existence of quasi-resonances at sufficiently large $\mu$. In the time domain, the late-time signal exhibits oscillatory tails with a power-law envelope, whose decay rate matches analytic expectations. Grey-body factors are also computed, showing strong suppression of radiation when mass is increased. Taken together, these results indicate that massive fields provide distinctive signatures of regular black holes and may serve as probes of near-horizon quantum corrections in the Dymnikova geometry.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the motion of charged particles with a magnetic dipole moment orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an external paraboloidal magnetic field. The interaction between the particle's intrinsic magnetic moment and the black hole magnetosphere is modeled through a dipole coupling, and the equations of motion are derived using the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We analyze equatorial circular orbits, the innermost stable circular orbit, and epicyclic oscillations, showing that the magnetic field strength and coupling parameter produce competing effects on orbital stability and fundamental frequencies. These frequencies are applied to model high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations within the relativistic precession framework. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black holes, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. The analysis constrains the black hole mass, magnetic field strength, field geometry, coupling parameter, and QPO orbital radius, highlighting the role of magnetospheric interactions in shaping both particle dynamics and timing properties of accreting black holes.

#### Vanishing Compactness Gap and Fermionic Compact Dark Matter in Hořava-Lifshitz Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the gap in the compactness between black holes and neutron stars witnessed in general relativity may be vanishing in Hořava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity. Assuming a fermion equation-of-state for simplicity, and solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation within the HL gravity framework, we see that there exists a minimum fermion mass $m_f^\text{(min)}(q,y)$, above which the gap of the compactness between black hole and fermionic compact object vanishes, for a given deformation parameter $q$ of HL and interaction strength $y$ between fermions. Thus, in HL gravity, the mass and radius of an object found in the lower mass gap by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations might not be able to classify it as a black hole or a neutron star. It is interesting to note that a fermion of mass $\sim 40\ \text{GeV}$ can form a highly compact object of mass $\sim 10^{-4}\ \msun$ and radius $\sim 1\ \text{m}$ that may play the role of the cold dark matter. In addition, we find the possible existence of another class of compact objects whose compactness is comparable to that of a black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 Static, spherically symmetric black holes immersed in a dark matter halo with a Hernquist-type density profile have been derived by Cardoso et. al. in Ref. \redcite{Cardoso:2021wlq}. Using the Newman-Janis algorithm, we construct the metric for a stationary and axially symmetric rotating black hole in this environment. Then, we obtain the electromagnetic properties of thin accretion disks around such rotating black holes by utilizing the steady-state Novikov-Thorne model, and study the effects of spin parameter and halo compactness parameter on the disk properties. Finally, by comparison the results of the rotating Cardoso black hole with that of Kerr black hole in the absence of dark matter, we find that the presence of dark matter can not significantly affect the disk properties and thus for astrophysical black holes with large spin parameter, the distinction of rotating Cardoso black holes becomes more difficult than the Kerr black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate critical phenomena during the gravitational collapse of a massive scalar field under two distinct semi-classical loop quantum gravity (LQG) approaches within spherical symmetry. Numerical simulations reveal that the massive scalar field in both semi-classical frameworks exhibits two distinct types of critical behavior, consistent with the classical scenario. When the scalar field's mass parameter is small, type II critical phenomena emerge, with the resulting echoing periods and critical exponents precisely matching those obtained in general relativity. In contrast, a large mass parameter triggers type I critical phenomena, where the resulting black holes possess a finite minimum mass. These findings suggest that semi-classical corrections from LQG have a negligible impact on the dynamics of critical collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 This work employs the minimal geometric deformation decoupling scheme to derive interior stellar solutions in the background of an electrically charged BTZ ansatz as a seed metric in three dimensions. In this respect, we impose two different equations of state to determine the deformation function and the new material contributions emerging from the additional field source. Furthermore, we describe the finiteness of all thermodynamic quantities of the presented stellar solutions, including the effective thermodynamical quantities, for varying values of the deformation parameter and total electric charge. We explore the new interior astrophysical solutions in three-dimensional gravity by analyzing the charged BTZ metric, admitting circular symmetry through the principles of geometric deformation. This study examines the impact of radial-metric deformation on the charged BTZ geometry and underscores the importance of stellar decoupling within the context of electrically charged dense distributions. It is shown that new physically acceptable solutions by incorporating any known three-dimensional spacetime as the isotropic basis are possible, which in turn enable one to analyze the quantum effects due to low degrees of freedom at lower dimensions.

#### Time-reversed Shannon entropy as a chaos indicator for non-integrable systems

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel chaos indicator -- time-reversed Shannon entropy (TRSE) -- that leverages the interplay between time-reversal symmetry breaking and information entropy in curved spacetimes. By quantifying statistical discrepancies between forward and backward temporal evolution of particle orbits, TRSE robustly distinguishes chaotic from regular dynamics in non-integrable systems. In contrast, integrable systems exhibit stable, symmetric probability distributions preserved by conserved quantities such as the Carter constant. We validate the method through high-precision numerical simulations in both Kerr and Schwarzschild-Melvin black hole geometries, evolving trajectories forward and backward in time. Furthermore, we refine our previously introduced particle-pair mutual information (MIPP) and perform comprehensive parameter-space scans, revealing a strong quantitative agreement between MIPP and TRSE. The two indicators emerge as complementary probes of chaos: TRSE captures symmetry breaking in orbital evolution, while MIPP measures statistical correlations. Together, they establish a unified framework for diagnosing chaos in general relativistic systems, paving a new path to understand the fundamental nature of chaos in non-integrable systems.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we employ dynamical systems methods to analyse the large-scale structure by considering two distinct interaction models (linear and non-linear) within the dark sector, associated with a specific dynamical dark energy model inspired by the Veneziano ghost theory in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In these models, the dark energy density ($\rho_{DE}$) varies with the Hubble parameter ($H$), expressed as $\rho_{DE} = \alpha H + \beta H^2$. After defining the dimensionless parameters, we present autonomous equations that allow us to find the trace $\text{Tr}(J)$ and the determinant $D(J)$. With these solutions, we demonstrate the presence of unstable, saddle, and stable fixed points, corresponding to the radiation-, matter-, and dark-energy-dominated eras, respectively. Our results suggest that these models are theoretically viable for representing the interaction between dark sector fluids.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the correspondence between the quasinormal modes and grey-body factors of Schwarzschild--Tangherlini black holes. The gravitational perturbations in higher-dimensional black holes can be classified into scalar, vector, and tensor types. Considering the dimension-dependent forms of their effective potentials, the correspondence was examined for each dimension and perturbation mode. The accurate quasinormal modes were computed by suitably adopting the continued fraction and integration-through-midpoints methods, depending on the structure of the singularity. The grey-body factor can be obtained through its correspondence with the quasinormal mode, and its accuracy was analyzed by calculating its difference from the numerically computed grey-body factor. The correspondence failed for $l=2$ scalar gravitational perturbations in $D\ge7$ because the form of the potential is markedly different from that in four dimensions. The vector and tensor perturbation types exhibited good correspondence accuracies in all cases. The breakdown of the correspondence was rigorously demonstrated to stem from multiple potential barriers, and its applicability to each mode in higher dimensions was assessed.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper develops a geometric mechanics framework for the reduction of general relativistic hydrodynamic variational principles, from the variation of worldlines approach in 4D spacetime to 3-dimensional Eulerian descriptions. We consider a self-gravitating, barotropic fluid and obtain the Euler-Poincaré equations of the system by Lagrangian reduction. Using the decomposition of general relativity into 3 + 1 dimensions, with a direction of time defined, the gauge invariance of the action over spacetime diffeomorphisms permits a 3-dimensional description of the fluid diffeomorphism by gauge fixing. The configuration space thus mirrors the Newtonian case, and by employing the Euler-Poincaré theorem, we derive the Eulerian equations of motion, in the same form as the PDEs from Newtonian fluid dynamics. The equations of motion are then derived, where the fluid variables are measured in a separate frame of reference from the variables involving gravity. Furthermore, the general relativistic barotropic fluid exhibits a Kelvin-Noether circulation conservation, which we derive in both the inertial and moving frames of reference. Finally, potential applications to Numerical Relativity are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 The ``fortuitous'' Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) sector states in gauge theory have been argued to furnish a description, through holography, of generic BPS black hole microstates. They are expected to be strongly chaotic, a necessary feature to capture the black hole dynamics. This dovetails nicely with the existence of various random matrix models of JT supergravity with extended supersymmetry, within which the BPS chaos must be contained as a subsector. This paper identifies and studies a simple random matrix model that underlies all known random matrix models of JT supergravity. It is argued that it captures many essential universal features of fortuitous BPS chaos. The model is topological, naturally interpolating between the Bessel and Airy models, where the gap energy $E_0$ controls the interpolation, and seems to have a simple intersection theory interpretation.

 - **Abstract**
 In the present paper, we construct a new family of exact charged and rotating asymptotically Lifshitz black hole solutions in five dimensions. The spacetime solves Einstein equations coupled to a dilaton, two Abelian gauge fields, and axionic scalars supplemented by two generalized Chern-Simons terms. This configuration is characterized by a range of the free dynamical exponent $z$ and possesses nontrivial thermodynamical parameters, where we verify the first law of black hole thermodynamics and derive the corresponding Smarr relation. Motivated by applications to gauge/gravity duality, we then investigate a holographic superconductor in the rotating Lifshitz background. We study the condensation of the scalar operator and the AC conductivity of the dual system. These results show that increasing the rotation parameter suppresses the condensate and weakens the superconducting phase, while increasing the dynamical critical exponent enhances the superconducting order. To the best of our knowledge, the solutions presented here are the first to demonstrate five-dimensional rotating Lifshitz black holes supported by both electric and axionic charges. This opens up a new avenue to investigate non-relativistic holography beyond static backgrounds.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the holographic timelike entanglement entropy (HTEE) and timelike subregion complexity of a thermal CFT$_d$ deformed by a relevant scalar operator $\phi_0$, dual to a hairy black hole in AdS$_{d+1}$. We employ the prescription of merging spacelike and timelike surfaces at the interior, constructing an extremal surface homologous to a boundary timelike subsystem with a time interval $\Delta t$. Consequently, this deformation breaks the invariance of the imaginary component of HTEE observed in pure AdS$_3$ and BTZ geometry, introducing a nontrivial dependence on $\Delta t$. At small $\Delta t$, we derive analytical expressions that are in agreement with numerical results, and observe partial consistency with analytic continuation to temporal or spacelike entanglement entropy at the level of the near-boundary expansion. However, analytic continuation of CFT temporal entanglement entropy fails to reproduce the HTEE calculations under boundary deformation, even in $d=2$. Furthermore, we extend the numerical calculations to higher dimensions ($d=3$). In addition, we study holographic timelike subregion complexity within the complexity=volume conjecture and find that it remains real-valued, providing a complementary geometric probe of the black hole interior. In particular, for the BTZ black hole, we analytically show that the UV-finite term of the subregion complexity receives its entire contribution from the interior region alone.

 - **Abstract**
 We establish time-like entanglement entropy (TEE) as a novel tool to characterize the black hole interior from a single-boundary perspective. In the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, we show that TEE of time-like boundary strips exhibits linear growth as a function of temporal width in the limit of large temporal width, and that its imaginary part carries physical significance rather than being a constant. By analyzing charged, scalar-hairy black holes, we present evidence that TEE detects a hidden "causal phase transition" separating Type-I and Type-II interiors -- distinguished by singularity structure. We identify a critical temporal width $\tau_c$ that acts as the order parameter for this transition: for strips narrower than $\tau_c$, the system enters a distinct "time-like entanglement phase" dominated purely by time-like contributions, up to a regulator effect; conversely, for strips wider than $\tau_c$, space-like entanglement re-emerges. Notably, the existence of a Cauchy horizon drives the $\tau_c$ to infinity, leading to pure time-like entanglement. These results suggest that the TEE may supply a novel boundary quantum-information measure to detect structure hidden inside the black hole and suggests a deep connection between TEE and cosmic censorship.

#### Holography with an Inner Boundary: A Smooth Horizon as a Sum over Horizonless States

 - **Abstract**
 The (holomorphic) partition function of the Euclidean BTZ black hole with boundary modulus $\tau$, is the $S$-image of the Virasoro vacuum character, $\chi_{\rm vac}(-1/\tau)$. This object decomposes into primaries via the modular $S$-kernel: $\chi_{\rm vac}\left(-\frac{1}{\tau}\right)=\int_{0}^{\infty} dP S_{0P}(P,c)\chi_P(\tau)$. In this paper, we provide a bulk understanding of this spectral resolution using the Chern-Simons formulation of AdS$_3$ gravity with $two$ boundaries: an asymptotic torus and an excised Wilson line at the origin ("stretched horizon"). At infinity, we impose standard AdS$_3$ Drinfel'd-Sokolov (DS) gauge to obtain the Alekseev-Shatashvili (AS) boundary action for a coadjoint orbit. At the inner boundary, removing the Wilson line prepares the state at the cut as a sum over orbits of the $spatial$ cycle. Re-inserting a spatial holonomy Wilson line acts as a delta-function projector onto the corresponding primary, which together with boundary gravitons, reproduces the Virasoro character (e.g., of a conical defect). But we can also consider projectors onto the $conjugate$ basis $\tilde P$, of the dual cycle. A key observation is that this leads to $S$-kernels instead of delta functions, with the BTZ character arising when the dual cycle label is in the exceptional orbit. Our two-boundary construction provides a bulk understanding of BTZ entropy: holonomy zero modes at the horizon have an effective central charge $c_{\rm prim}=c-1$ from the kernel measure (primaries), while the universal Dedekind-$\eta$ in $\chi_P(\tau)$ contributes $c_{\rm desc}=1$ from boundary gravitons (descendants). Together, they reproduce the full Cardy entropy. While our methods are specific to AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, they are an explicit illustration that smoothness of the (Euclidean) horizon may emerge from a $sum$ over bulk states which are manifestly unsmooth.
