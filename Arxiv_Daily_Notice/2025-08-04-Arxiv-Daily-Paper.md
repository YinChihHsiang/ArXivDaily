 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed a new high-redshift population called little red dots (LRDs). Since LRDs may be in the early phase of black hole growth, identifying them in the early universe is crucial for understanding the formation of the first supermassive black holes. However, no robust LRD candidates have been identified at $z>10$, because commonly-used NIRCam photometry covers wavelengths up to $\sim5\,{\rm \mu m}$ and is insufficient to capture the characteristic V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of LRDs. In this study, we present the first search for $z\gtrsim10$ LRD candidates using both NIRCam and MIRI imaging from COSMOS-Web, which provides the largest joint NIRCam-MIRI coverage to date ($0.20\,{\rm deg^2}$). Taking advantage of MIRI/F770W to remove contaminants, we identify one robust candidate, CW-LRD-z10 at $z_{\rm phot}=10.5^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$ with $M_{\rm UV}=-19.9^{+0.1}_{-0.2}\,{\rm mag}$. CW-LRD-z10 exhibits a compact morphology, a distinct V-shaped SED, and a non-detection in F115W, all consistent with being an LRD at $z\sim10$. Based on this discovery, we place the first constraint on the number density of LRDs at $z\sim10$ with $M_{\rm UV}\sim-20$ of $1.2^{+2.7}_{-1.0}\times10^{-6}\,{\rm Mpc^{-3}\,mag^{-1}}$, suggesting that the fraction of LRDs among the overall galaxy population increases with redshift, reaching $\sim3\%$ at $z\sim10$. Although deep spectroscopy is necessary to confirm the redshift and the nature of CW-LRD-z10, our results imply that LRDs may be a common population at $z>10$, playing a key role in the first supermassive black hole formation.

 - **Abstract**
 With over two dozen detections in the Milky Way, double neutron stars (DNSs) provide a unique window into massive binary evolution. We use the POSYDON binary population synthesis code to model DNS populations and compare them to the observed Galactic sample. By tracing their origins to underlying single and binary star physics, we place constraints on the detailed evolutionary stages leading to DNS formation. Our study reveals a bifurcation within the well-known common envelope formation channel for DNSs, which naturally explains an observed split in the orbital periods of the Galactic systems. The two sub-channels are defined by whether the donor star has a helium core (Case B mass transfer) or a carbon-oxygen core (Case C) at the onset of the common envelope, with only the helium core systems eventually merging due to gravitational wave-modulated orbital decay. However, producing DNSs through both sub-channels requires either a generous core definition of $\simeq$ 30% H-fraction or a high common envelope ejection efficiency of $\alpha_{\rm CE}\gtrsim1.2$. By testing different supernova kick velocity models, we find that galactic DNSs are best reproduced using a prescription that favors low velocity kicks ($\lesssim 50 \, \rm km/s$), in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, our models indicate that merging DNSs are born from a stripped progenitor with a median pre-supernova envelope mass $\sim$ 0.2$M_{\odot}$. Our results highlight the value of detailed evolutionary models for improving our understanding of exotic binary star formation.

 - **Abstract**
 Powered by supermassive black holes at their centers, quasars are among the most luminous objects in the Universe, serving as important probes of cosmic history and galaxy evolution. The size of the accretion disc surrounding the black hole is a critical parameter for understanding quasar physics and their potential use as standard candles in cosmology. However, direct measurements of accretion disc sizes have so far been confined to the Local Universe ($z<0.2$), limiting our understanding of quasars during the peak of cosmic activity. Here, we report the first direct measurement of the accretion disc size in the quasar QSO J0455-4216 at $z=2.66$, when the Universe was only $\sim2$ Gyrs old. Medium-band filters mounted on the MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope at La Silla Observatory were used to isolate continuum emission regions during a six-month monitoring campaign. The light curves exhibit pronounced variability features and enabled the detection of inter-band time delays from different parts of the disc. We mapped the disc and located its ultraviolet-emitting outermost region at $3.02^{+0.33}_{-0.57}$ light-days from the black hole ($\sim 500$ AU). Given a supermassive black hole 900 million times the mass of the Sun, these measurements validate accretion disc theory at an unprecedented redshift and pave the way for efficient black hole mass estimates, reducing decades-long spectroscopic reverberation campaigns to just a few years or less.

 - **Abstract**
 It is generally believed that long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from the core collapse of rapidly spinning massive stars and at least some of them are powered by hyper-accreting black holes. However, definite proofs about the progenitor and central engine of these GRBs have not been directly observed in the past. Here we report the existence of a Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) signature with periodic frequency $\sim$0.02 Hz in the early X-ray afterglow phase of GRB 220711B. Such a low-frequency QPO likely signals the precession of a relativistic jet launched from a GRB hyper-accreting black hole central engine. The energy injection signature from the \textbf{late} X-ray observations (from $5\times 10^2s\sim 1\times10^4s$) is consistent with the precession hypothesis. The prompt $\gamma$-ray light curve does not show any QPO signature, suggesting that the X-ray flaring emission in the early afterglow phase and prompt emission likely originate from different accretion processess, indicating that the progenitor stars of GRBs have a core-envelope structure with a stratified angular momentum distribution and the late-time accretion disk likely has a misalignment with respect to the rotation axis of the black hole. Such a misalignment is not expected in a canonical collapsar model. As a result, the QPO signature in GRB 220711B may reveal a new formation channel of long GRBs, possibly a stellar-merger-induced core collapse, with the orbital angular momentum of the binary misaligned with the spin axis of the collapsing star.

#### A Joint Search for the Electromagnetic Counterpart to the Gravitational-Wave Binary Black-Hole Merger Candidate S250328ae with the Dark Energy Camera and the Prime Focus Spectrograph

 - **Abstract**
 The first detection of an optical counterpart to a gravitational wave signal revealed that collaborative efforts between instruments with different specializations provide a unique opportunity to acquire impactful multi-messenger data. We present results of such a joint search with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) for the optical counterpart of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA event S250328ae, a binary black hole merger candidate of high significance detected at a distance of 511$\pm$82 Mpc and localized within an area of 3 (15) square degrees at 50% (90%) confidence. We observed the 90% confidence area with DECam and identified 36 high-confidence transient candidates after image processing, candidate selection, and candidate vetting. We observed with PFS to obtain optical spectra of DECam candidates, Swift-XRT candidates, and potential host galaxies of S250328ae. In total, 3897 targets were observed by seven pointings covering ~50% of the 90% confidence area. After template fitting and visual inspection, we identified 12 SNe, 159 QSOs, 2975 galaxies, and 131 stars. With the joint observations of DECam and PFS, we found variability in 12 SNe, 139 QSOs, 37 galaxies, and 2 stars. We do not identify any confident optical counterparts, though the association is not ruled out for three variable candidates that are not observed by PFS and 6 QSO candidates without clear variability if the optical counterpart of S250328ae is faint. Despite the lack of confident optical counterparts, this paper serves as a framework for future collaborations between wide-field imagers and multi-object spectrographs to maximize multi-messenger analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic microwave background data from the Planck satellite, combined with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Type Ia supernovae from various samples, provide hints of dynamical dark energy (DE). These results indicate a peak in the DE density around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, with the highest significance observed when using the supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey. In this Letter, we show that this peak does not necessarily imply a true crossing of the phantom divide if the measured effective DE is not a single component, but a combination of standard and negative quintessence. The latter is characterized by negative energy density and positive pressure, both decreasing in absolute value and tending to 0 in the future. For appropriate values of the parameters, negative quintessence is relevant at intermediate redshifts and becomes subdominant in front of standard quintessence around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, giving rise to the aforementioned peak in the DE density. We find that our model is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM at a $3.27\sigma$ CL, which is comparable to the level of exclusion found with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. Our analysis leaves open the possibility of negative quintessence and other exotic fields existing in the low-energy universe, potentially playing a significant role in cosmic dynamics.

#### A Novel Formation Channel for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in the Early Universe via Primordial Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel formation channel for supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries in the early Universe, driven by primordial black holes (PBHs). Using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations, we explore the role of massive PBHs ($m_{\rm BH} \sim 10^6 M_\odot$) in catalyzing the formation of direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs), providing a natural in situ pathway for binary SMBH formation. PBHs enhance local overdensities, accelerate structure formation, and exert thermal feedback on the surrounding medium via accretion. Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from accreting PBHs suppresses H$2$ cooling, shifting the dominant gas coolant to atomic hydrogen. When combined with significant baryon--dark matter streaming velocities ($v_{\rm b\chi} \gtrsim 0.8 \sigma_{\rm b\chi}$, where $\sigma_{\rm b\chi}$ is the root-mean-square streaming velocity), these effects facilitate the formation of dense, gravitationally unstable, atomically cooling gas clouds in the PBH wake. These clouds exhibit sustained high inflow rates ($\dot{M}_{\rm infall} \gtrsim 10^{-2}-10^{-1} M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), providing ideal conditions for DCBH formation from rapidly growing supermassive stars of $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$ at redshift $z\sim 10-20$. The resulting systems form SMBH binaries with initial mass ratios $q\sim O(0.1)$ and separations of $\sim 10$ pc. Such PBH--DCBH binaries provide testable predictions for JWST and ALMA, potentially explaining high-$z$ sources such as Little Red Dots, and represent gravitational-wave sources for future missions like LISA and TianQin, bridging early-Universe black hole physics, multi-messenger astronomy, and dark matter theory.

 - **Abstract**
 Axion inflation is a well-motivated model of cosmic inflation with a rich phenomenology. The abundant production of gauge fields during axion inflation notably sources a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background signal, which nourishes the hope that future GW searches might have a chance to probe the model. In this paper, we scrutinize GW production during axion inflation in the gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a powerful numerical technique that captures the nonlinear dynamics of the system in the limit of vanishing axion gradients. We focus on axion inflation coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector, i.e., pure axion inflation (PAI), and perform the first-ever comprehensive parameter scan of GW production in the Abelian PAI model close to the onset of strong backreaction. Remarkably enough, we find that GW signals within the reach of future GW interferometers can only be realized in parameter regions that also lead to strong backreaction and that are in conflict with the upper limit on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, i.e., the allowed energy density of dark radiation. This observation defines a clear target for future lattice studies of axion inflation that may confirm or improve the predictions of our GEF benchmark.

 - **Abstract**
 The universe is a vast and complex system, and our understanding of its fundamental workings is constantly evolving. In this work, we present a novel modification to the standard theory of gravity by incorporating curvature, torsion, non-metricity, and the geometric structure of Weitzenböck spacetime. This modified framework, referred to as the Einstein--Cartan--Myrzakulov (ECM) model, enriched by Weitzenböck geometry, offers new insights into cosmological phenomena, including the accelerated expansion of the universe, the nature of dark energy and dark matter, and the formation of cosmic structures. Our model not only reproduces observed cosmic histories but also provides testable predictions that can be compared with current and future observational data. By addressing some of the most profound questions in modern cosmology, this work paves the way for a deeper understanding of the universe's evolution and the fundamental forces that govern it. The ECM model, extended through Weitzenböck spacetime, invites further exploration, offering the potential to revolutionize our conception of gravity and the cosmos.

 - **Abstract**
 Measurement of eccentricity in low-mass binary systems through gravitational waves is crucial to distinguish between various formation channels. Detecting eccentricity in these systems is challenging due to a lack of accurate eccentric waveform models and the high computational cost of Bayesian inferences. We access the eccentricities of six previously observed low-mass gravitational wave events using publicly available data from the first four observing runs of the LIGO and Virgo collaboration. We analyze the events using the new eccentric waveform model, SEOBNRv5EHM, and compare our results with the existing model, TEOBResumS-Dali. We also present the first eccentricity constraints for GW190814. To improve accuracy, we include higher-order modes in both models and optimize inference using efficient marginalization and parallelization techniques. We find that GW200105 exhibits non-negligible eccentricity, with a measured eccentricity of $e=0.135^{+0.019}_{-0.088}$ at 20 Hz (90% credible level) for TEOBResumS-Dali and $e=0.125^{+0.029}_{-0.082}$ for SEOBNRv5EHM, given a uniform eccentricity prior from 0 to 0.2. This provides moderate support for the eccentric hypothesis, with a Bayes factor of $\sim10-15$ in favor of the eccentric model. With a uniform log prior on eccentricity, the Bayes factor is reduced to 2.35. The remaining five sources are consistent with low eccentricity, with 90% upper limits from $e \leq 0.011$ to $e \leq 0.066$. We find no support for non-negligible eccentricity in GW190814.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the thermodynamic properties of black holes in Conformal Weyl Gravity (CWG) using the Mannheim-Kazanas solution, with particular emphasis on quantum corrections that become significant near the Planck scale. Our analysis employs the Hamilton-Jacobi tunneling formalism to derive the Hawking temperature, revealing explicit contributions from the conformal parameters $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $k$ that lead to substantial deviations from Schwarzschild black hole behavior. We incorporate quantum gravitational effects through the Generalized Uncertainty Principle, demonstrating systematic suppression of thermal radiation in the near-Planckian regime. Using an exponentially corrected entropy model, we compute the complete spectrum of QC thermodynamic potentials, including internal energy, pressure, heat capacity, and free energies. Our heat capacity analysis reveals critical phase transitions separating thermodynamically stable and unstable regions, with the scale-dependent parameter $\gamma$ playing a crucial role in controlling phase structure. The Joule-Thomson expansion analysis shows distinct cooling and heating regimes with inversion points that shift systematically with CWG parameters, capturing QC phase transitions absent in general relativity. We also examine gravitational redshift in CWG geometry, finding complex radial dependence that could provide observable signatures for distinguishing conformal gravity from Einstein's theory. Our results demonstrate that CWG offers a consistent framework for studying black hole thermodynamics beyond general relativity, with quantum corrections revealing rich phase structures and potential observational consequences.

#### Can the latent signatures of quantum superposition be detected through correlation harvesting?

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we explore correlation harvesting in quantum superposition, specifically focusing on the entanglement and mutual information extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in a mass-superposed BTZ black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that the superposed nature of spacetime induces interference effects that can significantly enhance the entanglement harvesting relative to a single spacetime background. In contrast to entanglement, the mutual information obtained in spacetime superposition is influenced by the proper distance between the two detectors. While the mutual information harvested in a superposed spacetime remains lower than that in a single spacetime when the proper distance between detectors is small, it exceeds that in a single spacetime for specific mass ratios as the distance increases. Notably, we find that both entanglement and mutual information harvesting reach their maxima when the final spacetime superposition state is conditioned to align with the initial spacetime state.

#### Unlocking New Paths for Science with Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals: Machine Learning-Enhanced MCMC for Accurate Parameter Inversion

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in space-borne antennas like LISA and Taiji promises deep insights into strong-field gravity and black hole astrophysics. However, the complex, non-convex likelihood landscapes of EMRI signals (compounded by instrumental noises) have long hindered reliable parameter estimation based on traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which often fail to escape local optima or require impractical computational costs. To address this critical bottleneck, we introduce Flow-Matching Markov Chain Monte Carlo (FM-MCMC), a pioneering Bayesian framework that synergizes continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) with parallel tempering MCMC (PTMCMC). By leveraging CNFs to rapidly explore high-dimensional parameter spaces and PTMCMC for precise posterior sampling, FM-MCMC achieves unprecedented efficiency and accuracy in recovering EMRI intrinsic parameters. By enabling real-time, unbiased parameter inference, FM-MCMC unlocks the full scientific potential of EMRI observations, and would serve as a scalable pipeline for precision gravitational-wave astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) are expected to originate from black holes interacting dynamically in dense astrophysical environments. In such environments, given that the velocity and cross section between the interacting black holes is low, dynamical capture may occur. Such events merge on very short timescales with high eccentricities and are expected to be detectable in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) sensitivity band. In this work, we present a dedicated search for dynamical black hole capture events in the third LVK observing run with the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) algorithm enhanced with Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) post-production. With this we consider two applications of GMM: a weakly-modeled approach searching for generic short transients under minimal assumptions, and a population informed approach, in which the GMM model is provided information on the parameter space occupied by the capture population. Although our search does not find any new significant GW events, we find that an informed GMM approach brings significant sensitivity improvements, enabling the detection of dynamical capture events up to a distance of 1.9 Gpc for a 200 $M_{\odot}$ equal mass binary. We present updated upper limit estimates of the rate at 90\% confidence, the most stringent of which is 0.15 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, a 34\% improvement with respect to previous observational estimates. Furthermore, while the weakly-modeled GMM approach is less sensitive to dynamical capture systems, we find that it is possible for these events to be detected up to a distance of 1 Gpc in the cWB-GMM all-sky short search under minimal assumptions. Finally, with the confident detection of GW190521, we estimate the rate of similar events to be 0.94 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, assuming the event originated from a dynamical capture.

 - **Abstract**
 Brans-Dicke gravity does not always reduce to General Relativity in the limit $\omega\to\infty$ for the coupling constant. This anomalous behavior is examined within the formalism of the first-order thermodynamics of scalar-tensor gravity. It is shown that this effect is linked to the non-vanishing nature of the chemical potential, in the Einstein frame formulation of the thermodynamic analogy, in the $\omega\to\infty$ limit.

 - **Abstract**
 The future space-based gravitational wave observatories are expected to provide unprecedented opportunities to explore intricate characteristics of black hole binaries, particularly for extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which a stellar-mass compact object slowly inspirals into a supermassive black hole. These systems are very prominent sources for testing gravity in the strong gravity fields and for probing potential deviations from general relativity, including those arising from the presence of fundamental scalar fields. In this work, we examine the impact of a scalar charge carried by the inspiraling object within the context of EMRIs. We focus on generic orbits that present both eccentricity and inclination to evaluate how these parameters affect the modifications induced by the scalar charge to the gravitational wave signal. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of orbital inclination, in particular, enhances the detectability of scalar field effects by introducing richer waveform features that deviate from the purely general relativistic case. The interplay among scalar charge, eccentricity and inclination provides a more complete sampling of the black hole spacetime, suggesting that EMRIs with such generic orbits represent compelling systems for stringently constraining or discovering new fundamental fields through future gravitational wave observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Inspired by the classical singularity theorems in General Relativity, Galloway and Ling have shown the following (cf. Theorem 0): If a globally hyperbolic spacetime satisfying the null energy condition contains a closed, spacelike Cauchy surface $(V,g,K)$ (with metric $g$ and extrinsic curvature ${K}$) which is strictly 2-convex (meaning that the sum of the lowest two eigenvalues of $K$ is positive) then $V$ is either a spherical space or past null geodesically incomplete \cite{Ling, Ling2}. In the present work we relax the convexity condition in two respects. Firstly (cf. Theorem 1) we admit $2$-convex extrinsic curvatures, (for which the sum of the lowest two eigenvalues is non-negative) which allows for the following further possibility: Either $V$ or some finite cover $\tilde V$ are surface bundles over the circle, with totally geodesic fibers. Secondly, (cf. Theorem 2) if $(V,g,{K})$ admits a $U(1)$ isometry group with corresponding Killing vector $\xi$, we can further relax the convexity requirement in terms of the decomposition of ${K}$ with respect to the directions parallel and orthogonal to $\xi$. Compared to Theorem 1, this yields more specific information on the possible foliations of $V$, depending on whether the isometry is tangent to the base or to the fibers. Moreover, in the special cases that $V$ is either non-orientable, or non-prime, or an orientable Haken manifold with vanishing second homology, we obtain stronger statements in both Theorems without passing to covers. While our results do not use Einstein's equations, we provide several classes of $\Lambda$-vacuum solutions of these equations as examples.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive regular black-hole solutions, including the Hayward metric, from four-dimensional action principles involving vector fields in addition to the metric. These black holes possess additional hair associated with the vector fields, manifesting as free integration constants that regularize the geometry. These constants can be chosen such that regular black holes of all masses are extremal. As a result, they have vanishing surface gravity and are not susceptible to mass-inflation instability. We also discover another regular black-hole metric with these properties, which constitutes a gravastar for an appropriate choice of integration constant.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the geometric and physical properties of an anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole space-time coupled by a cloud of strings and surrounded by a quintessence-like fluid, all within the framework of non-commutative (NC) geometry. From the perspective of geometrical optics, we analyze the behavior of null geodesics, focusing on key optical features such as the effective potential, the structure and radius of the photon sphere, light deflection angles, photon trajectories, and the resulting black hole (BH) shadow. Our findings show that the combined effects of the string cloud and quintessence-like fluid significantly modify photon dynamics and optical observables, leading to notable deviations from standard BH scenarios in NC geometry background. We also examine time-like geodesics, with particular emphasis on the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs). The results demonstrate that the presence of geometric matter components alters the ISCO radius compared to conventional solutions. In addition, we explore the thermodynamic behavior of the BH, deriving expressions for the Hawking temperature, entropy, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. The influence of the string cloud and quintessence-like fluid introduces substantial modifications to the thermodynamic profile, including shifts in phase transition points and changes to stability conditions under NC geometric effects. Furthermore, we study the dynamics of massless scalar field perturbations in this modified background by formulating the Klein-Gordon equation and reducing it to a Schrödinger-like form via separation of variables. The resulting effective potential is analyzed in detail, highlighting the significant role of both the string cloud and the quintessence-like fluid in shaping the perturbative landscape within the NC geometry setting.

#### Volume as an index of a subalgebra

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new way to understand the volume of certain subregions in the bulk of AdS spacetime by relating it to an algebraic quantity known as the index of inclusion. This index heuristically measures the relative size of a subalgebra $\mathcal{N}$ embedded within a larger algebra $\mathcal{M}$. According to subregion-subalgebra duality, bulk subregions are described by von Neumann algebras on the boundary. When a causally complete bulk subregion corresponds to the relative commutant $\mathcal{N}' \cap \mathcal{M}$ -- the set of operators in $\mathcal{M}$ that commute with $\mathcal{N}$ -- of boundary subalgebras, we propose that the exponential of the volume of the maximal volume slice of the subregion equals the index of inclusion. This ``volume-index'' relation provides a new boundary explanation for the growth of interior volume in black holes, reframing it as a change in the relative size of operator algebras. It offers a complementary perspective on complexity growth from the Heisenberg picture, and has a variety of other applications, including quantifying the relative size of algebras dual to the entanglement wedge and the causal wedge of a boundary region, as well as quantifying the violation of additivity of operator algebras in the large $N$ limit. Finally, it may offer insights into the volume growth of de Sitter space through the changes in North and South pole observer algebras in time.
