 - **Abstract**
 We present a panchromatic optical-mm characterization of GNz7q, a recently identified X-ray weak, rapidly growing red quasar embedded within a dusty starburst galaxy at $z=7.1899$, using the full suite of JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, MIRI, and archival NOEMA observations. Our deep NIRSpec/G395M spectroscopy reveals unambiguous broad Balmer emission (FWHM $=2221\pm20$kms$^{-1}$), confirming a super-Eddington accreting black hole ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}=2.7\pm0.4$) with a mass of $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot})=7.55\pm0.34$, using accretion-rate corrected BH mass estimators. After subtracting the point source, we robustly detect stellar emission from the host galaxy across multiple NIRCam and MIRI filters. Out joint morphological-spectral analysis yields a stellar mass of $\log (M_*/M_\odot)=10.5\pm0.4$ and an intense star formation rate of ${\rm SFR}=330\pm97\,M_\odot\,\rm yr^{-1}$, confirming the host as a massive, dusty starburst galaxy. We find that GNz7q lies on the local $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation ($M_{\rm BH}/M_*\simeq 0.001$) and is well positioned to evolve into the locus of massive SDSS quasars with $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot)\approx 9$ and $M_*\approx 10^{11}\,M_\odot$ at $z\sim 6$, owing to its remarkably rapid growth in both the black hole and its host galaxy. This stands in stark contrast to many recently reported JWST AGN populations at similar redshifts, including the little red dots (LRDs), whose weak or undetected star formation makes it difficult for them to grow into the massive galaxies hosting SDSS-like quasars. These results suggest that GNz7q marks as a rare, pivotal phase of early BH-galaxy co-eolution, plausibly providing a crucial direct pathway to the supermassive black hole systems within the first billion years of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are rare transients that provide important insights into the physics of galactic nuclei. A recently identified feature in their optical light curves is the presence of early bump-like structures (precursors) that appear before the onset of the main flare or during its rise. Aims. We aim to build and study the first sample of precursor TDEs in order to improve our understanding of these features, which could be key to revealing the origin of the optical emission in TDEs. Methods. We compiled all known precursor TDEs from the literature, searched for additional candidates, and analyzed them as a sample. Results. We find that precursor TDEs predominantly fall within the repeating TDE, fast TDE, and TDE in active galactic nucleus (AGN) subclasses. We reveal a positive correlation between the occurrence time of the precursors relative to the main peak and the central black hole mass. Conclusions. We suggest that the precursors appear due to interactions between the incoming stellar debris and the disk or leftover material from an earlier disruption (repeating and fast TDEs) or a stable pre-existing disk (TDEs in AGNs). Precursors are therefore potentially key signatures of repeating partial TDEs in previously quiescent galaxies.

#### The Role of Faraday Rotation in the Polarization of the X-rays from Magnetically Powered Black Hole Coronas

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection is one of the prime candidate mechanisms that may energize the plasma emitting the strongly polarized X-ray emission from black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) in their hard states. The mechanism requires strong magnetic fields in the upstream plasma entering the reconnection layer, and weaker, but still substantial, magnetic fields in the downstream regions. In this Letter, we estimate the coronal magnetic fields for three different magnetic energy dissipation mechanisms: plasmoid-dominated magnetic reconnection, fast collisionless reconnection, and magnetic field relaxation. We show that the lack of strong Faraday depolarization constrains viable models and can be used to benchmark numerical accretion flow models. We conclude by discussing the difficulties of disentangling the various effects that can depolarize the signals from BHXRBs at low energies. We furthermore emphasize that Faraday rotation is unlikely to play a role in the polarization of the coronal X-ray emission of active galactic nuclei.

#### The Structure and Evolution of LRDs: Insights from JWST NIRSpec Medium and High Resolution Spectroscopy at $z\sim4$

 - **Abstract**
 We present an analysis of medium/high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectra for 11 LRDs at $z \sim 4$. By decomposing the broad and narrow components of the Balmer emission lines, we investigate the connection between line emission and UV/optical continua for the LRD population. We find that the broad H$\alpha$ luminosity strongly correlates with the optical continuum (but not with the UV), indicating a common AGN origin for both. In contrast, the [O III] line strength is correlated with the UV continuum rather than the optical. Using the width and luminosity of the broad H$\alpha$ line, we estimate central black hole masses of $10^6-10^8 M_{\odot}$ accreting at high Eddington ratios, consistent with an early ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim 0.6$), rapid-growth phase of AGN evolution. Assuming a constant mass accretion rate in the framework of slim-disk models, we infer growth timescales of $\sim 10^5-10^7\rm yr$, and suggest LRDs may evolve into narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. Upper limits from our spectra indicate that LRDs exhibit intrinsically weak optical Fe II emission compared to typical AGN. To simultaneously account for the inferred broad-line region size and observed luminosity, we propose a "Clumpy Envelope" model in which the optical emission arises from an extended, clumpy gas with a characteristic radius of tens of light-days. The diversity in observed optical continuum shapes can be explained by radial temperature gradients and self-absorption effects within this structure. Our results demonstrate the power of JWST high-resolution spectroscopy in probing the central engines and physical nature of the LRD population.

#### Demographics of Wandering Black Holes Powering Off-Nuclear Tidal Disruption Events

 - **Abstract**
 The recent discovery of three off-nuclear tidal disruption events (EP240222a, AT2024tvd, and AT2025abcr) - following the first such source, 3XMM J2150$-$05 - reveals a small but robust population of off-nuclear, or `wandering', black holes (WBHs) with masses $M_\bullet > 10^4 M_\odot$. Two demographic trends are already apparent: (i) all events occur in massive, early-type parent galaxies with stellar masses $10.8 \lesssim \log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \lesssim 11.1$; and (ii) events at larger halo-centric radii ($R_{\rm TDE}/R_{200}$) are associated with dwarf satellites ($M_\star \sim 10^7 M_\odot$), while those closer to halo centers lack detected stellar counterparts. Using results from the \texttt{ROMULUS} cosmological simulation, we show that both trends naturally arise from hierarchical galaxy formation. By combining the simulation with empirical constraints on the local galaxy population, we compute the volumetric density of WBHs, $\phi_{\rm WBH}(M_\star)$, finding that it peaks at $\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot)=11.10^{+0.05}_{-0.10}$ and that more than half of all WBHs in the local Universe reside in galaxies with $10.7 \lesssim \log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) \lesssim 11.2$, explaining (i) and predicting its persistence as the sample grows. We further show that ii), i.e., the observed link between detection of stellar counterparts and $R_{\rm TDE}/R_{200}$, is also expected from tidal stripping. These results demonstrate that off-nuclear TDEs are powered by the population of WBHs long predicted by cosmological simulations.

#### An updated constraint for the Gravitational Wave Background from the Gamma-ray Pulsar Timing Array

 - **Abstract**
 Fermi LAT observations of gamma-ray pulsars can be used to build a pulsar timing array (PTA) experiment to search for gravitational wave (GW) signals at nanohertz frequencies. At those frequencies, the dominant signal is expected to be a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) produced by the incoherent superposition of the quasi-monochromatic GW emissions from a population of supermassive black hole binaries. While the radio PTAs have recently announced compelling evidence for a GWB signal with a power law spectrum of strain amplitude $\approx2-3\times10^{-15}$ (at the frequency of $1 {\rm yr}^{-1}$), in 2022 an analysis of $12.5$ years of Fermi data for 35 pulsars led to an upper limit of $1\times10^{-14}$ for the GWB amplitude. The analysis was carried out on times-of-arrival (TOAs) obtained by folding from six months up to one year of photon observations. A photon-by-photon approach was also tested to infer constraints on the GWB amplitude from individual pulsars, but without accounting for the cross-pulsar correlations that a GWB would induce. Here, we reanalyse the same dataset using a regularized likelihood method that correctly models cross-pulsar correlations directly from the photons, while additionally marginalising over the uncertain pulse profile shape. While the two methods are not expected to have significant differences in sensitivity, we prove through simulations of gamma-ray PTA datasets that the photon-by-photon method for GWB recoveries is, statistically, more robust. The resulting upper limit obtained for the GWB strain amplitude is $1.2\times10^{-14}$, indicating that the improved method yields a consistent result with the previous analyses.

#### $\texttt{GPUmonty}$: A GPU-accelerated relativistic Monte Carlo radiative transfer code

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce $\texttt{GPUmonty}$, a CUDA/C-based Monte Carlo radiative transfer code accelerated using graphics processing units (GPUs). $\texttt{GPUmonty}$ derives from the CPU-based code $\texttt{grmonty}$ and offloads the most computationally expensive stages of the calculation -- superphoton generation, sampling, tracking, and scattering -- to the GPU. Whereas $\texttt{grmonty}$ handles photons sequentially, $\texttt{GPUmonty}$ processes large numbers of superphotons concurrently, leveraging the single-instruction, multiple-thread (SIMT) execution model of modern GPUs. Benchmarks demonstrate a speedup of about $12\times$ relative to the original CPU implementation on a single GPU, with runtime limited primarily by register pressure rather than compute or memory bandwidth saturation. We validate the implementation through analytic tests for a optically thin synchrotron sphere, as well as comparisons with $\texttt{igrmonty}$ for scattering synchrotron sphere and GRMHD simulation data. Relative errors remain below a percent level and convergence is consistent with the expected $N_{\rm s}^{-1/2}$ Monte Carlo scaling. By significantly reducing computational costs, GPUmonty enables the extensive parameter space surveys and faster spectra modeling required to interpret horizon-scale observations of supermassive black holes. $\texttt{GPUmonty}$ is publicly available under the GNU General Public License.

 - **Abstract**
 New general relativity (NGR) possesses a region in the \((c_{a},c_{v},c_{t})\)-parameter space corresponding to physically acceptable models. However, when solving the field equations for vacuum and non--vacuum static and spherically symmetric configurations under the assumption of the existence of a local black hole horizon, we find that the mere existence of such solutions imposes algebraic constraints that fix the parameters to values associated with known pathological models. As a consequence, we conclude that NGR is unable to describe physically meaningful non-trivial black holes.

#### Impact of Spin Priors on the Population Inference of Merging Binary Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 The spins of merging binary black holes (BBHs) inferred from gravitational-wave (GW) observations provide key insights into their formation channels. However, spin parameters are typically weakly constrained from data, and their inferred values are often strongly influenced by the assumed prior in Bayesian analyses. A commonly used prior, uniform in spin magnitudes and isotropic in spin directions, assigns vanishing probability density to spin-orbit-aligned configurations, potentially biasing inferences for BBH parameters. The prior choice can also affect population-level analyses by degrading the convergence of Monte Carlo integrations used to evaluate the likelihood in hierarchical Bayesian inference. In this work, we propose a novel spin prior that is uniform in the effective spin parameters Xeff and Xp, two spin combinations that can be relatively well measured from GW data, conditioned on the mass ratio. Using simulated BBH populations, we show that the inferred spin population can depend on the choice of prior, and that the proposed prior more accurately recovers the underlying spin population, particularly when the true distribution favors aligned-spin configurations. Because mass and spin measurements are correlated, our prior also enables a more accurate recovery of the underlying mass distribution.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider the most general parity symmetric effective scalar tensor theory in four dimensions containing terms up to fourth derivative order in the Lagrangian. It has been shown [H.S. Reall, Phys. Rev. D 103 (2021), 084027] that this theory has three polarizations generically goverened by different (nested) propagation cones, neither of which in general coincides with the lightcone as defined by the metric. Consequently, the notion of black hole horizon must be defined relative to the widest propagation cone, and not with respect to the metric. We provide two theorems stating that, nevertheless, the horizon of a \emph{stationary} black hole is null with respect to the metric, and that, in fact, all three propagation cones touch on the horizon. The conditions in these theorems allow for rotating black holes. Our theorems thereby suggest that the notion of Killing horizon, central in most discussions of black hole thermodynamics, retains its fundamental status, and that certain thermodynamic paradoxes associated with multiple propagation cones are evaded.

#### Are black hole spins truly near-zero?

 - **Abstract**
 The fourth gravitational-wave transient catalog, GWTC-4.0, reports 153 binary black hole mergers with false-alarm rates $<1,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Chirp masses are typically measured well, with the smallest fractional uncertainty being $2%$ at the $90%$ credible level. Spins, on the other hand, are poorly constrained: the median of the best-measured spin component of the population, the effective spin, is $\chi_{\rm eff}=0.04$, with a typical $90%$ credible uncertainty of $\Delta\chi_{\rm eff}=0.44$. The large majority -- $90%$ of the observed black holes -- are consistent with spin magnitudes $\chi<0.57$ and are weakly aligned with the orbits. At $90%$ credibility, the peaks of the inferred posteriors for spin magnitude are found to lie in the range $0.01$--$0.23$. We show that this ``near-zero spins'' conclusion may be prior-driven, and that uniform-in-magnitude spin priors lead to under-exploration of the moderate-to-high spin region of parameter space. Adopting a physically agnostic prior that is uniform in spin-vector configuration space (i.e., spin states uniform within a unit sphere) yields similar constraints on $\chi_{\rm eff}$, but substantially different spin-magnitude inferences than GWTC-4.0. The resulting shift in spins directly impacts tests of general relativity, constraints on near-extremal Kerr remnants, and astrophysical conclusions, including diagnostics of formation channels and hierarchical growth. In short, the data do not require vanishing spins -- the prior does, and accounting for this is essential for robust GR tests and population inferences.
