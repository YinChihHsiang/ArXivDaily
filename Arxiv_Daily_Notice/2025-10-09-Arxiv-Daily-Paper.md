 - **Abstract**
 (Edited) We introduce a flexible framework for building gravitational wave (GW) event catalogs in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation. Our framework couples the state-of-the-art binary population synthesis code SEVN with Arepo-GW -- a module fully integrated into the moving-mesh code Arepo -- to assign merger events of binary compact objects to stellar particles in simulations by stochastically sampling merger tables generated with SEVN. Arepo-GW supports both on-the-fly operation, producing event catalogs during simulations, and post-processing, using snapshots from existing runs. The algorithm is fully parallel and can be readily adapted to outputs from other simulation codes. To demonstrate the capabilities of our new framework, we applied Arepo-GW in post-processing to simulations from the MillenniumTNG suite, including its flagship box. We investigate key properties of the resulting GW event catalog, built on SEVN predictions, focusing on comoving merger rates, formation efficiencies, delay-time distributions, and progenitor mass and metallicity distributions. We also examine how these properties vary with simulated volume. We find that GW progenitor rates closely track simulated star formation histories and are generally consistent with current observational constraints at low redshift, aside from a factor of $\sim 4.5$ excess in binary black hole mergers. Moreover, our binary black hole merger rates decline more slowly with redshift than current observational estimates for $z \lesssim 1$. Finally, the analysis of progenitor mass functions across different formation channels reveals only mild redshift evolution, while the binary black hole mass function displays features compatible with current observational determinations. These findings highlight the potential of our novel framework to enable detailed predictions for upcoming GW surveys within a full cosmological context.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamics of the intra-cluster medium (ICM), the hot plasma that fills galaxy clusters, are shaped by gravity-driven cluster mergers and feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBH) in the cluster cores. XRISM measurements of ICM velocities in several clusters offer insights into these processes. We compare XRISM measurements for nine galaxy clusters (Virgo, Perseus, Centaurus, Hydra A, PKS\,0745--19, A2029, Coma, A2319, Ophiuchus) with predictions from three state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suites, TNG-Cluster, The Three Hundred Project GADGET-X, and GIZMO-SIMBA, that employ different models of feedback. In cool cores, XRISM reveals systematically lower velocity dispersions than the simulations predict, with all ten measurements below the median simulated values by a factor $1.5-1.7$ on average and all falling within the bottom $10\%$ of the predicted distributions. The observed kinetic-to-total pressure ratio is also lower, with a median value of $2.2\%$, compared to the predicted $5.0-6.5\%$ for the three simulations. Outside the cool cores and in non-cool-core clusters, simulations show better agreement with XRISM measurements, except for the outskirts of the relaxed, cool-core cluster A2029, which exhibits an exceptionally low kinetic pressure support ($<1\%$), with none of the simulated systems in either of the three suites reaching such low levels. The non-cool-core Coma and A2319 exhibit dispersions at the lower end but within the simulated spread. Our comparison suggests that the three numerical models may overestimate the kinetic effects of SMBH feedback in cluster cores. Additional XRISM observations of non-cool-core clusters will clarify if there is a systematic tension in the gravity-dominated regime as well.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsar timing arrays have recently found evidence for nanohertz gravitational waves that are consistent with being produced by a cosmological population of binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, the amplitude of this gravitational wave background is larger than predicted from theoretical and empirical models of SMBH binary populations. We investigate preferential accretion onto the secondary, less massive SMBH of the binary as a potential solution to this discrepancy. We carry out the first observationally-based analysis of the effect of preferential accretion on the SMBH binary population, and we find that preferential accretion onto the secondary SMBH increases the binary SMBH mass ratio, causing many minor galaxy mergers to lead to major SMBH mergers. The fraction of SMBH mergers that are major mergers increases by a factor of 2-3 when preferential accretion is included. Further, we find that only a small amount of preferential accretion (10% total SMBH mass growth) is needed to bring the predicted gravitational wave background amplitude into agreement with observations. Preferential accretion has an even larger effect on gravitational wave signals detected by LISA, which will probe SMBH binaries at higher redshifts where the environment is more gas-rich, and can also help explain the rapid build up of overmassive black holes at high redshifts observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. It also shortens the time to the first detection of an individual SMBH binary emitting continuous waves. Preferential accretion strengthens the gravitational wave signals produced by any binary embedded in a circumbinary disk, including LIGO sources.

 - **Abstract**
 The delay time distribution (DTD) of binary black hole (BBH) mergers encodes the evolutionary link between the formation history and gravitational-wave (GW) emission. We present a non-parametric reconstruction of the mass-dependent DTD using the BBHs from the GWTC-4 that avoids restrictive assumptions of only power-law forms. Our analysis reveals for the first time the signature for mass-dependent evolutionary pathways: lower-mass systems ($20$-$40\,M_\odot$) are consistent with a scale-invariant DTD, whereas higher-mass BBHs ($40$-$100\,M_\odot$) provide the first direct tentative evidence of DTD that deviate from simple power laws, with a pronounced preference for rapid mergers around $2-6$ Gyrs. These findings reveal the advantage of the non-parametric technique in reconstructing the mass-dependent DTD and discovering for the first-time the presence of a potential time-scale associated with high-mass GW events.

 - **Abstract**
 Little Red Dots (LRDs) are a new class of compact extragalactic objects, with a v-shaped optical spectral energy distribution breaking close to the Balmer break wavelength, and broad, typically exponentially-shaped lines. They are believed to be supermassive black holes surrounded by very dense, ionized gas, leading us to explore for any departures from Case B recombination by examining the ratios of multiple hydrogen Balmer lines: $H\alpha$, $H\beta$, $H\gamma$, and $H\delta$. We analyze a dozen high-S/N LRDs with JWST/NIRSpec, measuring Balmer ratios in the seven objects with coverage of at least three lines. We decompose the line ratios into their respective broad and narrow components. Broad line ratios are consistent with Case B plus dust extinction in all objects but one, RUBIES EGS-49140, which departs from Case B expectations by more than $5\sigma$. The narrow components are consistent with minimal dust attenuation, while two objects exhibit narrow $H\alpha$/$H\beta \approx 1.8$. Such low decrements are observed in highly ionized density bounded nebulae, associated with starburst environments. Nevertheless, both flat decrement cases can be reconciled assuming an unresolved absorption feature. RUBIES EGS-49140, shows a high broad $H\alpha$/$H\beta$, but $H\gamma$/$H\alpha$ and $H\delta$/$H\alpha$ ratios are lower than expected for extinction-modified Case B, hinting at an unphysically steep dust law. These line ratios may be due to increased optical depth in the Balmer lines, as a direct effect of high density (log$n_e$ > 9) gas surrounding the black hole. If Case B recombination does hold in most LRDs, they must be moderate-to-heavily dust obscured ($A_V\simeq1-8$) while the host-galaxy should be dust-free, suggesting that the extinction in the broad lines is local to the LRD and not due to the general ISM of the host galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 The Little Red Dot (LRD) paradigm comprises three main unknowns that are intrinsically connected: (1) What is the nature of these sources? (2) How do they form? (3) How do they evolve? Larger spectroscopic samples and high-resolution data are needed to delve deeper into the mechanisms ruling these sources. Understanding their formation and evolution requires identifying the rise and fall of the key features that characterize these systems, such as their compactness and ``V''-shaped spectral energy distributions. In this work, we present a galaxy system nicknamed The Stingray that was identified in the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). This group contains three sources at $z_{\mathrm{spec}} = 5.12$, including an active galactic nucleus (AGN), a Balmer break galaxy, and a star-forming satellite. The latter resembles a Building Block System in which interactions boost stellar mass and black hole mass growth beyond what is expected from secular processes alone. The AGN in this system exhibits features indicative of a transitional object, bridging a normal AGN and an LRD phase. These are a blue rest-frame ultraviolet slope, compact size, and a broad H$\alpha$ line (all of which are characteristic of LRDs), but a flatter rest-frame optical slope compared to that observed in LRDs. The features in this source point to the emergence or fading of an LRD, potentially triggered by environmental effects.

 - **Abstract**
 A variety of processes in the very early universe can give rise to a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with an extended mass spectrum. For certain mass spectra of this sort, it has been shown that the evaporation of these PBHs into radiation can drive the universe toward an epoch of cosmological stasis which can persist for a significant number of $e$-folds of cosmological expansion. However, in general, the initial mass spectrum which characterizes a population of PBHs at the time of production can subsequently be distorted by processes such as mergers and accretion. In this paper, we examine the effects that these processes have on the spectra that lead to a PBH-induced stasis. Within such stasis models, we find that mergers have only a negligible effect on these spectra within the regime of interest for stasis. We likewise find that the effect of accretion is negligible in many cases of interest. However, we find that the effect of accretion on the PBH mass spectrum is non-negligible in situations in which this spectrum is particularly broad. In such situations, the stasis epoch is abridged or, in extreme cases, does not occur at all. Thus accretion plays a non-trivial role in constraining the emergence of stasis within scenarios which lead to extended PBH mass spectra.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the properties of the nuclear star cluster (NSC) in the low surface brightness galaxy AGC 223218. The disk of the galaxy can be modeled using two S$\acute{\rm e}$rsic components with distinct central positions: one representing the inner bright disk and the other corresponding to the extended outer disk. We estimate the stellar masses of the NSC and the host galaxy using two methods: spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and mass-to-light versus color relations (MLCRs). The stellar mass ratio of the NSC to AGC 223218 is 0.094 based on the SED method and 0.072 using MLCRs. The NSC presents a younger stellar population and a lower [Fe/H] value than the host, as determined from SDSS and LAMOST spectra analysis using pPXF fitting. AGC 223218 is located at the boundary between the Seyfert and star-forming regions in the [SII]-BPT diagram, whereas in the [NII]-BPT diagram, it falls in the track of star-forming SDSS galaxies. This suggests the presence of strong shocks in AGC 223218. We propose that the NSC in AGC 223218 may have formed as a result of a merger event. Furthermore, the observed X-ray luminosity of AGC 223218 with eROSITA is two orders of magnitude higher than the expected X-ray luminosity from X-ray binaries, suggesting the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the NSC. To account for the observed X-ray luminosity, we estimate the IMBH accretion rate to be approximately 0.001.

 - **Abstract**
 IC 10 X-1, NGC 300 X-1, and Cyg X-3 represent a unique class of X-ray binaries consisting of a stellar-mass black hole (BH) accreting material from a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star companion. These systems are particularly intriguing due to their short orbital periods (less than 1.5 d), making them promising progenitors of gravitational wave (GW) sources detectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. With a newly implemented prescription for accretion efficiency in the standard Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) framework and a corrected treatment of dynamical tides, we present for the \textit{first} time detailed binary evolution models to diagnose their properties at different evolutionary states and evaluate their fates as potential GW sources detectable by the LVK network. With additional constraints on the observed properties of IC 10 X-1 and NGC 300 X-1, we determine that the upper limit of the BH mass in these systems (IC 10 X-1: $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 25\, M_\odot$, NGC 300 X-1: $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 15\, M_\odot$) is much lower than previously estimated. Both systems are expected to form binary black holes (BBHs) that will merge within a Hubble time, unless the BH in NGC 300 X-1 has a mass of $9\,M_\odot$, the lower limit estimated in a previous study based on the continuum-fitting method employing a relativistic slim-disc model. For Cyg X-3, we find that the upper limit on the BH spin magnitude cannot exceed 0.6. Interestingly, the WR star in Cyg X-3 is likely to form a lower-mass gap BH, and the resulting binary BH system will merge within the Hubble time.

 - **Abstract**
 The 136 year long optical light curve of OJ~287 is explained by a binary black hole model where the secondary is in a 12 year orbit around the primary. Impacts of the secondary on the accretion disk of the primary generate a series of optical flares which follow a quasi-Keplerian relativistic mathematical model. The orientation of the binary in space is determined from the behavior of the primary jet. Here we ask how the jet of the secondary black hole projects onto the sky plane. Assuming that the jet is initially perpendicular to the disk, and that it is ballistic, we follow its evolution after the Lorentz transformation to the observer's frame. Since the orbital speed of the secondary is of the order of one-tenth of the speed of light, the result is a change in the jet direction by more than a radian during an orbital cycle. We match the theoretical jet line with the recent 12 $\mu$as-resolution RadioAstron map of OJ~287, and determine the only free parameter of the problem, the apparent speed of the jet relative to speed of light. It turns out that the Doppler factor of the jet, $\delta\sim5$, is much lower than in the primary jet. Besides following a unique shape of the jet path, the secondary jet is also distinguished by a different spectral shape than in the primary jet. The present result on the spectral shape agrees with the huge optical flare of 2021 November 12, also arising from the secondary jet.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results of Pop. III formation in the MEGATRON suite of simulations, which self-consistently follows radiation and non-equilibrium chemistry, and resolves gas at near-pc resolution of a Milky Way-mass halo at Cosmic Dawn. While the very first Pop. III stars form in halos with masses well below the atomic cooling limit, whose cooling is dominated by molecular hydrogen, the majority of Pop. III stars form in more massive systems above the $10^4$~K atomic cooling threshold. The shift in cooling regime of halos hosting new Pop. III stars occurs within $100$ Myr of the first Pop. III star as the Lyman-Werner (LW) background rapidly increases to $10^{-21}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,Hz^{-1}\,sr^{-1}$. We find that the global Pop. III star formation rate stabilizes to a value of $10^{-3}\,\rm M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$ at $z=20$. Among the three processes that quench Pop. III star formation in mini-halos, the LW background, gas starvation, and external chemical enrichment, the LW background is most important. A small fraction of haloes undergo multiple episodes of Pop. III star formation when the earlier forming stars all directly collapse to black holes. If the halos become massive enough, they can form up to $\sim100$ Pop. III stars in a single burst, which may be observable by JWST with moderate gravitational lensing. Pop. III stars form at a wide range of distances from UV-bright galaxies, with only $0.06\%$ of Pop. III stars forming within the virial radius of galaxies with $M_{\rm UV} < -17$. Finally, by tracking Pop. III star remnants down to $z=0$, we find that $75-80\,$% reside in the stellar halo of our simulated Milky Way analogue, while the remainder are gravitationally bound to lower-mass systems, including satellite halos.

 - **Abstract**
 The Gaia collaboration announced the discovery of a massive black hole (BH) with a low-mass giant star companion, Gaia BH3, located in the ED-2 stellar stream. The properties of Gaia BH3 bridge the gap between known Milky Way BHs and extragalactic BHs found with gravitational waves (GWs). We aim to determine the most likely formation scenario for Gaia BH3 in the progenitor cluster of the ED-2 stream. We perform $N$-body simulations of that progenitor cluster and find that, most likely, Gaia BH3 formed from a stellar binary that formed during cluster formation, which then underwent multiple dynamical interactions that significantly altered its properties, including exchanging the companion star. We highlight the importance of cluster dynamics and discard a formation scenario where it evolved in quasi-isolation.

#### Archival Inference for Eccentric Stellar-Mass Binary Black Holes in Space-Based Gravitational Wave Observations

 - **Abstract**
 Space-based gravitational-wave observatories will detect the early inspiral of stellar-mass binary black holes and can track their eccentricity evolution. However, untargeted searches in the space band are computationally demanding and require relatively high detection thresholds (signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 15$). Information from ground-based detections can significantly shrink the parameter space for space-band analyses and thereby substantially reduce the detection threshold. We present a Bayesian inference pipeline for ground-triggered archival space-band analyses that includes eccentricity. Using ground-informed priors, we demonstrate that with one year of LISA or TianQin data a GW190521-like source with signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 7$ can be distinguished and tightly constrained. In this setup, space observations sharpened the redshifted chirp mass from $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})M_\odot$ to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})M_\odot$, and constrain the eccentricity to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ around the injected value $e_{0.01\mathrm{Hz}}=0.1$. These results demonstrate that inference of eccentric stellar-mass binary black holes in noisy space-band data is practically feasible, supports an expanded yield of multiband detections, and strengthens prospects for future astrophysical and gravitational tests.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a Bayesian null-stream method to constrain calibration errors in closed-geometry gravitational-wave (GW) detector networks. Unlike prior methods requiring electromagnetic counterparts or waveform models, this method uses sky-independent null streams to calibrate the detectors with any GW signals, independent of general relativity or waveform assumptions. We show a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. We discuss prospects for next-generation detectors like Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer, and LISA, where enhanced calibration accuracy will advance low-frequency GW science.

 - **Abstract**
 Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observations of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) will provide long duration inspiral signals with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data, ideal for testing general relativity (GR) in the strong-field and high-velocity regime. We present an extension of the Flexible Theory-Independent (FTI) framework, adapted to gravitational waves (GWs) from MBHBs observed with LISA, to perform parametrized inspiral tests of GR. This approach introduces generic deviations to the post-Newtonian (PN) coefficients of the frequency-domain GW phase while accounting for the time- and frequency-dependent instrument response, thus effectively identifying potential deviations from GR by constraining modifications to the PN phasing formula. Complementary analyses using Fisher matrix and full Bayesian approaches confirm that LISA observations could improve constraints on deviations from GR by at least two orders of magnitude compared to the most recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA measurements. Since LISA`s sensitivity to different GW phases -- inspiral, merger, and ringdown -- varies across the MBHB parameter space with masses between $10^4$ and $10^7M_{\odot}$, the optimal regime for testing deviations is not known a priori. Our results illustrate how the strength of these constraints depends significantly on both the total mass and the SNR, reflecting the trade-off between inspiral and merger-ringdown contributions to the observed signal. We also investigate the interplay between inspiral-only versus inspiral-merger-ringdown analyses in constraining these inspiral deviation parameters. This work contributes to the development of robust tests of GR with LISA, enhancing our ability to probe the nature of gravity and BHs with GW observations.

#### On planetary orbits, ungravity and entropic gravity

 - **Abstract**
 In previous works, entropic gravity and ungravity have been considered as possible solutions to the dark energy and dark matter problems. To test the viability of these models, modifications to planetary orbits are calculated for ungravity and different models of entropic gravity. Using the gravitational sector of unparticles, an equation for the contribution to the effect of orbital precession is obtained. We conclude that the estimated values for the ungravity parameters from planetary orbits are inconsistent with the values needed for the cosmological constant. The same ideas are explored for entropic gravity arising from a modified entropy--area relationship.

 Numerical relativity simulations provide a full description of the dynamics of binary systems, including gravitational radiation. The waveforms produced by these simulations have a number of applications in gravitational-wave detection and inference. In this work, we revisit the accuracy of the waveforms produced by the Spectral Einstein Code. Motivated by the wide range of waveform applications, we propose and explore three accuracy metrics between simulation resolutions: (i) the generalized frequency-weighted mismatch, (ii) the relative amplitude difference, and (iii) the phase difference at different times. We find that numerical errors accumulate over the binary evolution, but the error is not intrinsically larger during the latest, more dynamical stages. Studying errors across the parameter space, we identify a positive correlation between both the mismatch and the phase difference with precessing spin, but little correlation with aligned spin or eccentricity. Lastly, amplitude and phases differences are symmetric upon exchanging resolutions across the catalog, suggesting that there is no systematic error.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose that black holes are \emph{soliton-esque} objects, where gravitational collapse is balanced by quantum vacuum dispersion, modeled via \(R+\alpha R^{2}\) gravity. Classical singularities are replaced by oscillating, finite-radius cores, thereby evading static no-go theorems. The event horizon is replaced by the \textit{Lamarina}, a surface of maximum redshift whose surface geometry yields Hawking-like radiation with corrections. The Raychaudhuri equations impose a Dyson-type ceiling on the maximum radiated power \((P_{\infty} \lesssim c^{5}/G)\), while effective field theory matching dictates a universal minimum Lamarina radius set by the dispersion scale.

 - **Abstract**
 We explicitly construct a three--parameter family of asymptotically flat Einstein--Maxwell instantons. These solutions are toric, regular, and free of conical and orbifold singularities on the manifold $M=\CP^2\setminus S^1$. They are counterexamples to the Euclidean Einstein--Maxwell Black Hole Uniqueness Conjecture. In the case of vanishing charge these instantons reduce to the Chen--Teo Ricci flat instantons.

 - **Abstract**
 The Benenti-Francaviglia (BF) family of metrics provides the most general form of a spacetime metric that admits two mutually commuting Killing vectors and an irreducible Killing tensor. The geodesic equations for the BF family are thus completely integrable by separation of variables. Within this broad class, we explore the Kerr-Schild transformation of a degenerate subclass distinguished by the existence of a shear-free null geodesic congruence. By requiring the deformed metric to preserve the Killing symmetry and circularity, we demonstrate that the deformed metric again falls into the degenerate BF family, modulo the replacement of a single structure function. We apply the present algorithm to ${\cal N}=2$ gauged supergravity and obtain a dyonic generalization of the Chong-Cvetič-Lü-Pope rotating black hole solution, by taking the background metric to be a solution of the Einstein-scalar gravity. The present prescription extends to five dimensions, provided that the constant of geodesic motion associated with the extra Killing direction vanishes. The same reasoning applies to the case where the background degenerate BF metric is distorted in a (non)conformal manner. Our formalism offers a unified perspective on the relation between seed and deformed metrics in the Kerr-Schild construction.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.06689

 - **Abstract**
 We study quasinormal modes of a massive scalar field in the background of the regular, quantum-corrected Bonanno-Reuter black hole, which arises from the renormalization group improvement of the Schwarzschild solution within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. The analysis is performed in both the time and frequency domains. We find that increasing the mass of the field leads to a strong suppression of the damping rate, and extrapolation to larger masses indicates the emergence of arbitrarily long-lived oscillations, or quasi-resonances. In the time domain, the late-time decay follows an asymptotic behavior that differs from the power-law tails of the classical Schwarzschild case. Furthermore, we compute the grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections for the massive scalar field and show that the grey-body factors decrease as the field mass increases, effectively shifting the emitted radiation spectrum toward higher frequencies.

 - **Abstract**
 The correspondence of single-field cosmological models based on Einstein gravity to modern observational data is considered. A method is proposed to determine possible types of dynamics based on extreme values of the scalar field. It is shown that within the framework of this approach, it is possible to obtain a limited class of known inflationary models at early times. It is also shown that on large times the proposed approach leads to the $\Lambda$CDM--model in order to describe the dynamics of the second accelerated expansion of the universe. An interpretation of the considered models is presented as a starting point for constructing verifiable cosmological models based on modified gravity theories.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave signals are typically interpreted under the vacuum hypothesis, i.e. assuming negligible influence from the astrophysical environment. This assumption is expected to break down for low-frequency sources such as extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), which are prime targets for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and are expected to form, at least in part, in dense environments such as Active Galactic Nuclei or dark-matter spikes/cores. Modeling environmental effects parametrically is challenging due to the large uncertainties in their underlying physics. We propose a non-parametric test for environmental effects in EMRIs, based on assessing the self-consistency of vacuum parameter posteriors inferred from different portions of the signal. Our results demonstrate that this approach can reveal the presence of astrophysical environments, or even deviations from General Relativity, without introducing additional parameters or assumptions about the underlying physics.

#### Unified Dark Matter and Dark Energy in a model of Non-Canonical Scalar-Tensor Theory

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07103

 - **Abstract**
 We consider a model of non-canonical scalar-tensor theory in which the kinetic term in the Brans-Dicke action is replaced by a non-canonical scalar field Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}(X, \phi)= \lambda X^\alpha \phi^\beta - V(\phi)$ where $X = (1/2) \partial_{\mu} \phi \partial^{\mu} \phi$ and $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\lambda$ are parameters of the model. This can be considered as a simple non-canonical generalization of the Brans-Dicke theory with a potential term which corresponds to a special case of this model with the values of the parameter $\alpha = 1$, $\beta = -1$ and $\lambda = 2w_{_{BD}}$ where $w_{_{BD}}$ is the Brans-Dicke parameter. Considering a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker Universe with scale factor $a(t)$, it is shown that, in the matter free Universe, the kinetic term $\lambda X^\alpha \phi^\beta$ can lead to a power law solution $a(t)\propto t^{n}$ but the maximum possible value of $n$ turns out to be $(1+\sqrt{3})/4 \approx 0.683$. When $\alpha \geq 18$, this model can lead to a solution $a(t)\propto t^{2/3}$, thereby mimicking the evolution of scale factor in a cold dark matter dominated epoch with Einstein's General Relativity (GR). With the addition of a linear potential term $V(\phi) = V_{0}\phi$, it is shown that this model mimics the standard $\Lambda$CDM model type evolution of the Universe. The larger the value of $\alpha$, the closer the evolution of $a(t)$ in this model to that in the $\Lambda$CDM model based on Einstein's GR. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that this model with a linear potential can mimic the GR based $\Lambda$CDM model. However, with an appropriate choice of the potential $V(\phi)$, this model can provide a unified description of both dark matter and dynamical dark energy, as if it were based on Einstein's GR.

 - **Abstract**
 The existence or absence of gravitational radiation escaping from the spacetime at $\mathscr{J}$ is characterized in the presence of a cosmological constant $\Lambda$ of any sign. To that end, the properties of the asymptotic super-momentum are used. When $\Lambda=0$, the characterization is equivalent to that based on the News tensor. For $\Lambda\neq 0$, it provides the first reliable definition of existence of radiation at $\mathscr{J}$, and it gives fully satisfactory results in known exact solutions.

 - **Abstract**
 The recently reported binary black hole merger, GW231123, has unusual properties that make it hard to explain astrophysically. Parameter estimation studies are consistent with maximally spinning black holes and the dimensionless spin of the more massive component is constrained to be $\chi_1\gtrsim 0.8$. Analysis of data also revealed potential systematics that could not be fully replicated with simulated studies. We explore the possibility that these measurements are biased due to unmodeled non-Gaussian noise in the detectors, and that the actual black hole spins are more modest. We present evidence for a population of \textit{microglitches} in LIGO gravitational-wave strain data that can lead to biases in the parameter estimation of short-duration signals such as GW231123. Using simulated data of a massive event like GW231123, we demonstrate how microglitches can bias our measurements of black hole spins toward $\chi\approx1$ with negligible posterior support for the true value of $\chi\approx0.7$. We develop a noise model to account for microglitches and show that this model successfully reduces biases in the recovery of signal parameters. We characterize the microglitch population in real interferometer data surrounding GW231123 and find a single detector glitch duty cycle of $0.57_{-0.19}^{+0.21}$, which implies nearly a $100\%$ probability that at least one event through the fourth gravitational wave transient catalog coincides with microglitches in two detectors. We argue that further investigations are required before we can have a confident picture of the astrophysical properties of GW231123.

#### Can One Model Gravitational Nonlinear Memory with Fractional Derivative Operators?

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07232

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether fractional calculus, with its intrinsic long-tailed memory and nonlocal features, can provide a viable model for gravitational-wave memory effects. We consider two toy constructions: ($i$) a fractional modification of the linearized Einstein field equations using a sequential Caputo operator, and ($ii$) a fractionalized quadrupole formula where the source moment is acted upon by the same operator. Both constructions yield history-dependent responses with small memory-like offsets. However, in all cases, the signal decays to zero at late times, failing to reproduce the permanent displacement predicted by GR. Our results, therefore, constitute a no-go demonstration: naive fractionalization is insufficient to model nonlinear gravitational memory. We argue that any successful model must incorporate fractional kernels directly into the hereditary flux-balance integral of General Relativity, while preserving gauge invariance and dimensional consistency. We also discuss possible connections to modified gravity and the absence of memory in the spacetime with dimensions $D>4$.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the implications provided by the modified Painlevé-Gullstrand coordinates in the context of quintessence for the Kiselev black hole. In this regard, we set up a fully static line element in terms of lapse and shift functions, apart from including the deformation parameter signaling deviation from the standard Painlevé-Gullstrand metric. We address two specific issues pertaining to the problems of radiation and dust furnished by the corresponding barotropic index parameter and study the related consequences by performing a range of analyses to explore the influence imposed by quintessence. We also discuss the thermodynamical consequences by evaluating the expressions of the Hawking temperature and the entropy function in closed forms.

#### Modified Fronsdal coordinates for maximally extended Schwarzschild spacetime

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a coordinate system that complements the Kruskal--Szekeres extension. Like the standard construction, it covers the maximally extended Schwarzschild manifold in its entirety, while offering an additional advantage of expressing the areal radius as an explicit function of the new coordinates. Its main limitation, however, is that radial null geodesics are no longer represented as 45-degree lines in the Kruskal plane, making the causal structure more difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, the new system offers a compelling aesthetic trade-off: among all known maximally extended systems - including those of Kruskal-Szekeres, Israel, Fronsdal, Novikov, and Synge - it exhibits the highest degree of symmetry with respect to Schwarzschild's original r- and t-coordinate lines. It trades the regular pattern of Kruskal's light cones for a symmetric nesting arrangement of the two-dimensional spheres. The proposed extension sheds new light on the closely related Fronsdal's six-dimensional embedding construction, and clarifies the deep connection that exists between the most important implicit (Kruskal-Szekeres) and explicit (Israel's) procedures for maximal extension of the Schwarzschild geometry that is well known to those working in the field but rarely presented in textbooks on general relativity.

#### Detecting Black Hole Microstates

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that the Euclidean two-point function of an appropriately chosen probe operator can detect the microstate of an asymptotically AdS black hole. This detection, which requires a tuned, state-dependent choice of probe, is the result of a new gravitational saddle, which dominates over the usual saddles. The gravitational result can be explicitly reproduced in the dual boundary CFT if we assume the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We also discuss a binary search protocol to detect the black hole microstate from a candidate list.

#### SymTFT Entanglement and Holographic (Non)-Factorization

 - **Abstract**
 Given two otherwise decoupled $D$-dimensional CFTs which possess a common (finite) symmetry subcategory, one can consider entangled boundary states of their $(D+1)$-dimensional SymTFTs. This roughly corresponds to performing a gauging of the tensor product of two CFTs, and we call this phenomena ``SymTFT entanglement" (or ``S-entanglement" for short). In the case when these CFTs have semiclassical holographic duals, the S-entanglement relates the bulk gauge charges between two otherwise disconnected AdS spacetimes as we highlight in several top-down examples. We show that taking partial traces of such S-entangled states leads to a streamlined approach to preparing ensemble-averaged CFTs in string theory. This ensemble averaging coincides with that generated by $\alpha$-states in the baby universe Hilbert space, and we propose a symmetry-enriched generalization of this Hilbert space via generalized global symmetries. We quantify how this symmetry-governed averaging violates holographic factorization and leads to the emergence of bulk global symmetries. We also consider the eternal (two-sided) AdS black hole geometries, where our SymTFT entanglement considerations imply that there exist refinements of the usual theromofield double state preparation of the system. We show that one may prepare the system in such a way that the total CFT data does not factorize into left and right copies. As anticipated by Marolf and Wall \cite{Marolf:2012xe}, we highlight that such considerations are necessary to define the gauge charges of eternal black holes, and in certain cases, can imply that there exist extended bulk objects stretching across the wormhole which cannot be expressed in terms of a product of left and right CFT operators.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine the behavior of sequences of states in the large $N$ limit of AdS/CFT duality in cases in which the bulk duals involve baby universes or black holes. Such sequences generally fail to converge as pure states. Under suitable conditions, such as diverging coarse-grained entropy, they can converge to mixed states for the large $N$ algebra, as in the case of black holes. For Euclidean preparations that produce baby universes, the sequences do not converge, due to wormhole contributions, and so these states cannot admit large $N$ limits. Nevertheless, appropriate averaging over $N$ can lead to convergence to a mixed state. The associated algebras have nontrivial commutants, which can possibly be interpreted as operators in the baby universe.

 - **Abstract**
 To satisfy the Cardy formula for Warped AdS$_3$ (WAdS$_{3}$) solutions in a quadratic ensemble, a specific set of boundary conditions has been proposed in \cite{Aggarwal:2020igb}. In this paper, these boundary conditions have been investigated in the three-dimensional new massive gravity (NMG) framework. The associated solution space, asymptotic symmetries, and charge algebra have been extracted. It has been shown that the surface charges are finite, but not integrable, and the integrability of the charges is obtained after restricting to a sub-sector of the original solution space. Finally, we have proved that the Cardy formula reproduces the thermodynamic entropy of a warped BTZ black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the thermodynamic properties of the regular Bardeen-AdS black hole obtained by imposing an additional constraint on a singular "mother" black hole. This constraint eliminates the physical singularity but leads to the breakdown of the standard first law of black hole thermodynamics. The singular black hole exhibits a reentrant phase transition similar to that of the higher-dimensional Kerr-AdS black hole. The Bardeen-AdS black hole exhibits $P-V$ criticalities similar to that of the RN-AdS black hole, however has striking differences in its Gibbs free energy behavior. In particular, the characteristic "swallow-tail" structure associated with first-order phase transitions disappears. Instead, an "8-shaped" or "c-shaped" structure occurs, signifying a first-order phase transition or a zeroth-order phase transition between the small black hole and the large black hole phases, respectively. Our analysis suggests that constraint-induced modifications in the thermodynamic phase space may have deep consequences for the critical behaviors of black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Microscopic charged black holes can provide possibilities to test the consistency of the effective field theory (EFT) corrections to Einstein-Maxwell theory. A particularly interesting result is fixing the sign of a certain combination of EFT couplings from the requirement that all charged black holes should be able to evaporate (Weak Gravity Conjecture). In our work, we analysed the EFT corrections to a set of zero-damping quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the scalar wave probe in a nearly extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole. We review the duality of this setup to the problem of the quantum Seiberg-Witten curve of $N=2$ Super-Yang-Mills theory with three flavors. We provide an analytic result for the EFT corrections to the QNMs obtained from the quantization condition imposed on the Seiberg-Witten cycle. Our main result is that the causality requirement of the gravitational theory formulated for the QNMs translates to the same condition on EFT couplings as the one appearing in the Weak Gravity Conjecture.

#### Localized structures in two-field systems: exact solutions in the presence of Lorentz symmetry breaking and explicit connection with geometric constraints

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate a class of models described by two real scalar fields in two-dimensional spacetime. The study focuses mainly on the presence of exact static solutions which satisfy the first-order formalism, in models constructed to engender Lorentz symmetry violation. We start by exploring a direct connection between Lorentz breaking and geometric constraint, as experimentally examined in the case of domain walls in geometrically constrained magnetic materials. By means of a specific choice of functions, we show that imposing geometric constraint within the Lorentz-violating framework recovers the exact solutions of the corresponding Lorentz-invariant theory. Furthermore, we extend the investigation to new models that go beyond reproducing the Lorentz invariant geometrically constrained solutions, revealing that it remains possible to parametrize the first-order equation of one of the fields through a suitably redefined coordinate.
