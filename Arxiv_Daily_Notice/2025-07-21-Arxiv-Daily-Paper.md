#### Variability in Black Hole Accretion: Dependence on Rotational and Magnetic Energy Balance

 - **Abstract**
 Most general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black hole (BH) hot accretion flows are initialized with small rotating tori and produce stable jets with only small fluctuations. However, recent studies using larger scale Bondi-like initial conditions have reported intermittent jet activity and loss of coherent rotation. To investigate the differences, we modify the standard torus setup across four BH spins: $a_*=0$, $0.5$, $0.9$, $-0.9$. First, we increase the torus size significantly (pressure maximum at 500 gravitational radii), allowing long simulations ($2.8\times10^5$ gravitational times) without gas depletion. These runs reproduce the weak variability seen in smaller tori, indicating that a larger dynamic range alone does not cause strong fluctuations. We observe moderate suppression of the accretion rate by factors of $\sim 1.6, ~2.5$ for BH spins $a_*=0.5,~0.9$, respectively, compared to $a_*=0$. Also, the density profile scales as $\rho(r)\propto r^{-1.1}$ for prograde BHs. Next, we considerably strengthen the initial magnetic field in the large torus by setting the plasma-$\beta\approx 1$. This induces strong variability in the evolution. The jet efficiency in the $a_*=0.9$ model, for instance, now varies by over 3 orders of magnitude, and gas rotation reverses directions. Combining these results with prior studies, we propose that a key parameter is the ratio $R$ between the rotational and magnetic energies in the initial state. Strong variability appears later in models with a larger value of $R$. The implication is that all simulations, and by extension all hot accretion flows in Nature, will ultimately develop intermittent jets if evolved long enough.

 - **Abstract**
 In modern-day astronomy, near-infrared, optical, and ultraviolet spectroscopy are indispensable for studying a wide range of phenomena, from measuring black hole masses to analyzing chemical abundances in stellar atmospheres. However, spectroscopic data reduction is often performed using instrument-specific pipelines or legacy software well-established and robust within the community that are often challenging to implement and script in modern astrophysical workflows. In this work, we introduce easyspec, a new Python package designed for long-slit spectroscopy, capable of reducing, extracting, and analyzing spectra from a wide range of instruments--provided they deliver raw FITS files, the standard format for most optical telescopes worldwide. This package is built upon the well-established long-slit spectroscopy routines of the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF), integrating modern coding techniques and advanced fitting algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. We present a user-friendly open-source Python package that can be easily incorporated into customized pipelines for more complex analyses. To validate its capabilities, we apply easyspec to the active galactic nucleus G4Jy 1709, observed with the DOLORES spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, measuring its redshift and estimating its supermassive black hole mass. Finally, we compare our results with a previous IRAF-based study.

#### Nature of High Equivalent Width Emitters in the Epoch of Reionization Revealed by JWST Medium-band Imaging

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at high redshifts are considered key contributors to cosmic reionization at $z>6$ due to their higher ionization efficiencies. We have identified 119 H$\beta$ + [OIII] emitters at $z\sim7$ selected by a flux excess in the medium-band filter F410M in the public James Webb Space Telescope Cycle-1 fields. Our emitters exhibit a wide range in rest-frame H$\beta$ + [OIII] equivalent width (EWs), 420 $<$ EW$_{0}$/Å $<$ 6850 (with the median value of $\sim1700$ Å). Among them, 19 are EW$_{0}$ $>$ 3000 Å, which represent extreme populations even in the context of recent findings with JWST. They are characterized by (i) low stellar mass ($\sim 3\times10^{7}$ $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$), (ii) blue colors ($\beta_{\rm UV}\sim -2.2$), and (iii) low dust attenuation ($A_{\mathrm{V}}\sim 0.1$ mag). We discuss the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed high rest-frame H$\beta$ + [OIII] EWs, including (1) photoionization by AGN, (2) stellar photoionization in the vicinity of HII regions, and (3) radiative shocks powered by outflows either from AGN or massive stars. Notably, we find 13 emitters with spatially offset H$\beta$ + [OIII] emission compared to the UV and stellar components. Given the absence of obvious signatures of actively accreting black holes, these emitters are likely under strong feedback-driven winds from massive stars. Lastly, we report a unique overdensity of EELGs in one of the observed fields. The discovery of such a "star-bursting" overdensity supports the idea that large ionizing bubbles formed around some EEGLs in the early Universe.

#### Equation of state during (p)reheating with trilinear interactions

 - **Abstract**
 We characterize the post-inflationary evolution of the equation of state of the universe from the end of inflation until the onset of radiation domination, when the inflaton is coupled to a daughter field through a trilinear interaction. We consider an inflaton potential that is quadratic near the minimum and flattens in the inflationary regime. By simulating the dynamics in 2+1-dimensional lattices, we have tracked the long-term evolution of the equation of state for about ten e-folds of expansion, for various coupling strengths. The trilinear interaction initially excites daughter field modes through a process of tachyonic resonance immediately after inflation and triggers a temporary deviation of the equation of state from $\bar{w} = 0$ to a maximum value $\bar{w} = \bar{w}_{\rm max} < 1/3$. However, at much later times, the inflaton homogeneous mode once again dominates the energy density, pushing the equation of state towards $\bar{w} = 0$ until the onset of perturbative reheating. By combining the lattice results with a Boltzmann approach, we characterize the entire post-inflationary expansion history, which allows to calculate precise predictions for the inflationary CMB observables. We also accurately compute the redshift of the stochastic gravitational wave background produced during preheating, and show that taking the temporary return of the equation of state towards $\bar{w} = 0$ into account can reduce the amplitude by many orders of magnitude relative to previous estimates.

#### The $z=7.08$ quasar ULAS J1120+0641 May Never Reach a "Normal" Black Hole to Stellar Mass Ratio

 - **Abstract**
 JWST observations of quasars in the Epoch of Reionization have revealed that many lie in host galaxies that are severely undermassive relative to the supermassive black holes. It is unclear how these systems will evolve to the tight local relation between stellar mass and black hole mass. We search for companions around the z=7.08 quasar ULAS J1120+0641 using JWST/NIRCam narrow, medium, and wide-band photometry to identify [O III] emitters at the quasar redshift, and explore the potential for growth of the host galaxy through future mergers. We find 22 sources near the quasar's redshift across our two 4.4 arcmin$^2$ fields, indicating that environment of ULAS J1120+0641 is strongly overdense in z~7.1 galaxies relative to the field. We estimate the potential future mass budget of the quasar host galaxy by summing the current stellar and gas masses of the quasar host and surrounding galaxies, correcting for incompleteness and selection effects. With no further black hole growth, ULAS J1120+0641 is unlikely to reach a $M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_*$ ratio less than ~2.5% at z=0, still much higher than typical for local galaxies. However, such systems -- a quiescent black hole in a low-luminosity galaxy -- may have escaped detection locally if they are sufficiently distant.

 - **Abstract**
 Newtonian noise limits the low-frequency sensitivity of ground-based gravitational wave detectors. While seismometers and geophones are commonly employed to monitor ground motion for Newtonian noise cancellation, their limited spatial coverage and high deployment costs hinder scalability. In this study, we demonstrate that distributed acoustic sensing offers a viable and scalable alternative, providing performance comparable to that of conventional seismic instruments. Using data from acoustic sensing and colocated seismometers during both natural and controlled events, we observe a strong correlation, exceeding 0.8, between the two sensor types in the 3 to 20 Hz frequency band relevant for Newtonian noise. Moreover, when distributed acoustic sensing data are used to predict geophone signals, the correlation remains high, above 0.7, indicating that distributed acoustic sensing accurately captures both the spatial and spectral features of ground motion. As a case study, we apply distributed acoustic sensing data to cancel noise recorded by the vertical component of a seismometer and compare the results with those obtained using geophone data for the same task. Both distributed acoustic sensing and geophone-based cancellations yield a residual noise factor of 0.11 at 20 Hz. These findings confirm the feasibility of using distributed acoustic sensing for Newtonian noise mitigation and highlight its potential, in combination with traditional seismic sensors, to improve environmental monitoring and noise suppression in current and next-generation gravitational wave observatories.

#### Magnetically Driven Retrograde Precession in Misaligned Black Hole Accretion Flows

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of accreting black hole (BH) systems, such as microquasars and supermassive black holes, often reveal a precessing jet with changing directions, indicating a misaligned accretion flow relative to the BH spin. The precession is commonly attributed to the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect, which arises from the BH's rotation twisting the surrounding spacetime and accretion flow. In the strongly magnetized regime, which is preferred accretion flow conditions for M~87$^*$ and likely other jet-producing systems, the large-scale magnetic field can significantly influence the flow dynamics. Here, we perform large-scale three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted accretion onto a rotating BH, and find a never-seen-before new retrograde precession. This precession arises from a magnetic torque on the disk generated by the poloidal magnetic field aligned with the BH's rotation, opposing the LT torque. This finding highlights the unique property of highly magnetized accretion flows around BHs and provides a new interpretation of jet precession observed in many systems.

 - **Abstract**
 Compact binary mergers, detected in gravitational waves since 2015, are candidate sources for astrophysical neutrinos in the GeV regime from proton-proton and proton-neutron collisions. This contribution presents the results of the search for such a signal using mergers detected during the fourth observing run of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA interferometers. We use the dense infill array at the center of the IceCube detector, IceCube-DeepCore, to select neutrino candidates in the 0.5-5 GeV energy range. The search for a statistically significant excess associated with an astrophysical signal is performed in a $\pm$ 500 s window around the gravitational wave detection time. We do not observe any statistically significant excess in the neutrino data, and set upper limits on the neutrino emission from these objects. Additionally, we search for subpopulations of neutrino-emitting sources, including merger events detected in previous observing runs; no significant signal has been identified yet.

#### Microlensing optical depth, event rate, and limits on compact objects in dark matter based on 20 years of OGLE observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud

 - **Abstract**
 Some previous studies have suggested that massive and intermediate-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) could comprise a substantial fraction of dark matter in the Universe. Such black holes, if they existed in the Milky Way halo, would give rise to long-duration microlensing events that may potentially last for years. However, earlier searches were not sufficiently sensitive to detect such events. Here, we present the results of searches for long-timescale gravitational microlensing events toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using nearly 20 years of photometric observations collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 to 2020. We found six events, three of which are new discoveries. We use a sample of five events to measure the microlensing optical depth toward the SMC $\tau = (0.32 \pm 0.18) \times 10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\Gamma = (1.18 \pm 0.57) \times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. The properties of the detected events are consistent with lenses originating from known stellar populations within the SMC or in the Milky Way disk. No events with timescales longer than 1 yr were detected, which provides competitive limits on the fraction of massive compact objects, including PBHs, in the Milky Way dark matter halo. Together with the earlier OGLE studies of microlensing events in the direction of the Large Magellanic Cloud, these observations rule out PBHs and other compact objects with masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^3\,M_{\odot}$ as dominant components of dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 Many white dwarfs are observed in compact double white dwarf binaries and, through the emission of gravitational waves, a large fraction are destined to merge. The merger remnants that do not explode in a Type Ia supernova are expected to initially be rapidly rotating and highly magnetized. We here present our discovery of the variable white dwarf ZTF J200832.79+444939.67, hereafter ZTF J2008+4449, as a likely merger remnant showing signs of circumstellar material without a stellar or substellar companion. The nature of ZTF J2008+4449 as a merger remnant is supported by its physical properties: hot ($35,500\pm300$ K) and massive ($1.12\pm0.03$ M$_\odot$), the white dwarf is rapidly rotating with a period of $\approx$ 6.6 minutes and likely possesses exceptionally strong magnetic fields ($\sim$ 400-600 MG) at its surface. Remarkably, we detect a significant period derivative of $(1.80\pm0.09)\times10^{-12}$ s/s, indicating that the white dwarf is spinning down, and a soft X-ray emission that is inconsistent with photospheric emission. As the presence of a mass-transferring stellar or brown dwarf companion is excluded by infrared photometry, the detected spin down and X-ray emission could be tell-tale signs of a magnetically driven wind or of interaction with circumstellar material, possibly originating from the fallback of gravitationally bound merger ejecta or from the tidal disruption of a planetary object. We also detect Balmer emission, which requires the presence of ionized hydrogen in the vicinity of the white dwarf, showing Doppler shifts as high as $\approx$ 2000 km s$^{-1}$. The unusual variability of the Balmer emission on the spin period of the white dwarf is consistent with the trapping of a half ring of ionised gas in the magnetosphere of the white dwarf.

#### Investigating $f(R)$-Inflation: background evolution and constraints

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13890

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the possibility of generating an inflationary mechanism within the framework of a metric-$f(R)$ modified gravity theory, formulated in the Jordan frame. We explore whether the scalar field, non-minimally coupled to gravity and emerging in the Jordan frame, can play the role of the primordial inflaton. Particular attention is devoted to constructing a dynamical scenario in the Jordan frame that exhibits a slow-rolling phase for the scalar field and admits a quasi-de Sitter solution for cosmic evolution. To ensure consistency with the standard cosmological model, we impose a matching condition with the $\Lambda$CDM model at the end of the inflationary phase. Furthermore, to address the problem of the absence of matter after inflation, we consider a radiation-type particle creation process that maintains an approximately constant energy density. We test our theoretical model against background observational data, specifically Pantheon+ calibrated with SH0ES and DESI calibrated with BBN. We asses its viability and discuss implications for alleviating the Hubble constant tension.

#### Transient QPOs of Fermi-LAT blazars with Linearly Multiplicative Oscillations

 - **Abstract**
 We present a study on the detection and characterization of transient quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the $\gamma$-ray emission of blazars 4C +31.03, MG1 J123931+0443, and PKS 1622$-$253. Using light curves derived from \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope data, we investigate oscillatory patterns characterized by periodic multiplicative amplitudes that vary linearly over time. By segmenting the light curves into increasing and decreasing trends, we analyze each segment independently, allowing for precise measurements of both the periodicity and long-term variations. To interpret these QPOs, we explore various theoretical scenarios that could explain their origin and underlying physical mechanisms. The estimated periods for blazars MG1 J123931+0443 and PKS 1622$-$253 are consistent with precessional dynamics expected in binary supermassive black hole systems, although our current results do not allow for a definitive conclusion.

 - **Abstract**
 Exotic dark matter (EDM) refers to a dark matter species whose equation of state deviates from zero at late times. This behavior enables it to model a variety of non-standard late-time cosmologies, offering alternatives to various dark energy (DE) models, especially when the DE sector violates the null energy condition. In this work, by fitting to CMB, BAO, and Supernovae (SNe) data and comparing models in a Bayesian approach, we show that simple models of exotic dark matter are statistically comparable to the $w_0w_a$CDM DE model in explaining the recent anomaly in the late-time cosmological evolution suggested by DESI and supernova observations, although in both classes of models the evidence against the $\Lambda$CDM model only appears when the DES-Y5 or Union3 SNe dataset is included. The value of $H_0$ remains similar to that in the DE model, except in the no-SNe case, where the DE model predicts lower values than $\Lambda$CDM, thereby worsening the Hubble tension, whereas the EDM models yield values closer to that of $\Lambda$CDM, albeit with larger uncertainty. In addition, the EDM models predict a drastically different energy budget for the present-day universe compared to the standard model, and provide an explanation for a coincident problem in the DE-model explanation of the DESI anomaly.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate gravitational lensing in the strong-field regime for a black hole in F(R) Euler Heisenberg Gravity with Rainbow gravity modifications. This black hole spacetime is characterized by the Euler Heisenberg parameter, F(R) parameters, Rainbow functions, the black hole charge Q, and mass M . We numerically compute the strong deflection angle and its associated coefficients, and explore their astrophysical implications for supermassive black holes in different galaxies. Our findings show that increasing the Euler Heisenberg parameter enhances key lensing observables such as the photon sphere radius, critical impact parameter, angular position, relative magnification, Einstein ring radius, and time delay for a fixed Q . Conversely, increasing Q decreases these parameters while keeping other quantities fixed. Additionally, a higher Euler Heisenberg parameter reduces the deflection angle and angular separation S , whereas increasing Q causes both to increase. Our study reveals that black holes in this modified gravity framework can act as strong gravitational lenses, producing deflection angles that surpass those of Reissner Nordstrom and Schwarzschild black holes under specific conditions. These results highlight the unique topological features of modified charged black holes and suggest their potential as astrophysical candidates, offering new insights into their observational signatures. Furthermore, we analyze the sensitivity of the lensing predictions with respect to changes in the functional forms of the Rainbow functions. The combined effects of F(R) gravity, Euler Heisenberg electrodynamics, and Rainbow gravity introduce novel qualitative features not present in the individual models.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, when combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), provide compelling evidence for a phantom crossing at late times, along with statistically significant deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate the role of redshift-space galaxy clustering data by employing the pre-reconstruction full-shape (FS) galaxy power spectrum from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data release 12 (DR12) sample. This dataset is analyzed in combination with BAO measurements from DESI data release 2 (DR2) and various SNIa samples. Our analysis demonstrates that the joint combination of these datasets can yield deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at a significance level of up to $\sim 5\sigma$, suggesting strong indications that the dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ may have crossed the phantom divide ($w = -1$) in the redshift range $z \sim 0.4$--$0.5$. The precise location and strength of this crossing depend on the adopted theoretical parameterizations. Importantly, our results reveal that this trend persists even in the absence of CMB data, underscoring the robustness of the FS power spectrum as a powerful and independent probe for testing dark energy models and for distinguishing between competing cosmological scenarios.

 - **Abstract**
 Magnetic reconnection in current layers that form intermittently in radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto black holes is a promising mechanism for particle acceleration and high-energy emission. It has been recently proposed that such layers, arising during flux eruption events, can power the rapid TeV flares observed from the core of M87. In this scenario, inverse Compton scattering of soft radiation from the accretion flow by energetic electron-positron pairs produced near the reconnection layer was suggested as the primary emission mechanism. However, detailed calculations show that radiation from pairs alone cannot account for the GeV emission detected by the Fermi observatory. In this work, we combine analytic estimates with 3D radiative particle-in-cell simulations of pair-proton plasmas to show that the GeV emission can be naturally explained by synchrotron radiation from protons accelerated in the current sheet. Although the exact proton content of the layer is uncertain, our model remains robust across a broad range of proton-to-pair number density ratios. While protons are subdominant in number compared to pairs, our simulations demonstrate that they can be accelerated more efficiently, leading to a self-regulated steady state in which protons dominate the energy budget. Ultimately, proton synchrotron emission accounts for approximately 5% to 20% of the total dissipation power. The majority is radiated as MeV photons via pair synchrotron emission, with a smaller fraction emitted as TeV photons through inverse Compton scattering.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze two different scenarios for the late Universe dynamics, resulting into Hubble parameters deviating from the $\Lambda$CDM, mainly for the presence of an additional free parameter, which is the dark energy parameter. The first model consists of a pure evolutionary dark energy paradigm, as result of its creation by the gravitational field of the expanding Universe. The second model also considers an interaction of the evolutionary dark energy with the matter component, postulated via the conservation of the sum of their ideal energy-momentum tensors. These two models are then compared \textit{via} the diagnostic tool of the effective running Hubble constant, with the binned data of the so-called ``Master sample'' for the Type Ia Supernovae. The comparison procedures, based on a standard MCMC analysis, led to a clear preference of data for the dark energy - matter interaction model, which is associated to a phantom matter equation of state parameter (very close to $-1$) when, being left free by data (it has a flat posterior), it is fixed in order to reproduce the decreasing power-law behavior of the effective running Hubble constant, already discussed in literature.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmic voids have emerged as powerful probes for cosmology, providing complementary information on the large-scale structure of the universe. We present the first application of a hydrodynamical framework to model the evolution of cosmic voids. This approach offers a physically intuitive characterization of void dynamics and can naturally be applied to non-standard cosmologies. We derive the cosmology-dependent mapping that relates the linear (Lagrangian) and fully non-linear (Eulerian) evolution of the matter density contrast, a central component for accurate theoretical modeling of void statistics. Furthermore, we present a new method for determining the shell-crossing epoch across arbitrary cosmological backgrounds, thereby extending previous treatments restricted to the Einstein-de Sitter universe. Motivated by recent DESI results hinting at dynamical dark energy, we investigate void evolution in $ w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies by varying $ w_0$ and $w_a$. We also consider the impact of varying the matter density parameter, $ \Omega_{\mathrm{m},0}$. We find that the evolution of isolated, spherically symmetric cosmic voids is most sensitive to $ \Omega_{\mathrm{m},0} $ and $ w_0 $, which can alter the non-linear density contrast by up to 20-30%. Variations in $w_a$ have a smaller impact, but may still lead to measurable effects. We also show that the cosmology-dependent mapping between linear and non-linear density contrasts may provide a sensitive probe of dynamical dark energy in precision void analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Double white dwarf binaries are an important remnant of binary evolution as they are possible type Ia supernova progenitors and strong sources of gravitational waves in the low-frequency regime. The double-lined double white dwarf (DBL) survey searches for compact double white dwarfs where both stars are spectrally disentangleable. Candidates are identified by being overluminous compared to the cooling sequence of a typical mass, single white dwarf. In this second DBL survey instalment, we present full orbital solutions of 15 double white dwarf binaries from our ongoing campaign to accurately measure a magnitude-limited mass-period distribution. 12 of these systems are fully solved for the first time. A long-standing bias in the full population has been evident, favouring systems with orbital periods up to a few hours, with little exploration of the majority of the compact double white dwarf population, whose orbital period distribution centres at approximately 20hr. The 15 systems in this study span the orbital period range 5-75hr, significantly augmenting the number of well-characterised systems over these periods, and in general have two similar mass stars combining to approximately 1.0 solar masses. We witness that the orbitally derived mass ratios generally show an excellent agreement with those deduced from atmospheric fits to double-lined spectra in previous work, emphasising the power of wide-scale spectroscopic surveys to efficiently locate the highest mass, double-lined double white dwarfs in the local Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 In theoretical cosmology, symmetric teleparallel gravity or $f(Q)$ gravity based on nonmetricity tensor Q has become an interesting alternative to General relativity in recent years. The present research paper contains a rigorous dynamical system analysis of coincident f (Q) gravity in the presence of a generalized DBI essence scalar field. We have considered two different models of coincident f(Q) gravity, such as power law model $f(Q) = Q + nQ^m$ and exponential model $f(Q) = Q e^{\frac{\beta Q_0}{Q}}$ respectively, where n, m, \b{eta} are constant parameter and Q is the nonmetricity component. In this study, the generalized DBI essence scalar field acts as an additional dark energy component. After obtaining the field equation for the corresponding cosmological model, we employed several dynamical variables to form the dynamical system. The critical points of these dynamical systems are influenced by cosmological parameters and associated with particular epochs in the cosmological timeline. For different combinations of cosmological parameters, the critical points exhibit different cosmological eras, starting from the accelerated stiff matter era to late-time acceleration phenomena. The stability criteria of each critical point are studied by using linear stability theory, and the physical constraints on the cosmological parameters are also considered during this analysis. Furthermore, the current values of energy densities, deceleration parameters, and equation of state parameters obtained from the evolution diagram are compatible with observational data.

 - **Abstract**
 Extensions of general relativity often predict modifications to gravitational waveform morphology that depend functionally on source parameters, such as the masses and spins of coalescing black holes. However, current analyses of strong-field gravity lack robust, data-driven methods to infer such functional dependencies. In this work, we introduce GRANITA, a non-perturbative, theory-agnostic framework to characterize parameter-dependent deviations from general relativity using Gaussian process regression. Leveraging the flexibility of this method, we analyze both simulated data and real events from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA public catalog. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to detect and quantify waveform deviations across the parameter space. Furthermore, we show that the method can identify stochastic (non-deterministic) deviations, potentially arising from environmental effects or subdominant unmodeled physics. As gravitational-wave tests of strong gravity advance in precision, our framework provides a principled approach to constrain modified gravity and to mitigate contamination from astrophysical or instrumental systematics.

 - **Abstract**
 By studying the chameleon gravity on galaxy scales, we investigate the effects of the chameleon dark matter. To perform this task, we consider the dynamics of the chameleon scalar field in the region of galactic halos in static spherically symmetric spacetimes that differ only slightly from classical general relativity, but have similar symmetry behind this region. Hence, we demonstrate its ability to act as dark matter. In fact, by obtaining the expression for the tangential speed in this region, we apply this approach to explain the issue of flat galactic rotation curves. We obtain that the mass associated with the chameleon scalar field varies linearly with the radius of galaxy, and hence, the tangential speed in that region is constant, which is consistent with observational data without any need to introduce a mysterious dark matter. Accordingly, we show that the presented chameleon gravity has a well-defined Newtonian limit and can describe the geometry of spacetime in the region of flat galactic rotation curves, and is consistent with the corresponding results of the $ \Lambda CDM $ model with the NFW profile. We also consider a test particle moving in a timelike geodesic and obtain the fifth-force, which varies proportionally to the inverse of the radius of galaxy. Moreover, we obtain the effects on the angle representing the deflection of light and on the time representing the radar echo delay of photons passing through the region of galactic halos. We show that as the radius of galaxy increases, the effect on the angle of light passing through the region around galactic halos decreases. Also, the obtained result indicates that the relevant time delay decreases with increasing radius towards the end of the galactic halo.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we examine the impacts of black hole spin, Lorentz-violating parameter, and the scalar field's mass on quasinormal modes (QNMs) of rotating Einstein-Bumblebee black holes, including computations up to the second-order expansion in rotation parameters. We investigate two classes of Lorentz-violating rotating black holes: one constructed via the Newman-Janis algorithm and the other obtained by solving the field equations through a series expansion. Within the slow-rotation approximation framework, we derive the master equations governing a massive scalar field and compute the corresponding QNM frequencies numerically using both the continued fraction method and the matrix method. The numerical results indicate that the QNM frequencies exhibit increased sensitivity to negative $\ell$ variations, which reduces the influence of the field mass parameter $\tilde{\mu}$. Meanwhile, the spectral "cube" of NJA black holes shows slight compression for $m>0$ with $ \ell>0 $ and expansion for $m<0$ with $ \ell>0 $ compared to another black holes, where $m$ is approximately proportional to the spin parameter at first order, while richer structures and lifted degeneracy emerge at second order.

 - **Abstract**
 The production site of heavy r-process elements, such as Gold and Uranium, is uncertain. Neutron star mergers are the only astrophysical phenomenon in which we have witnessed their formation. However, the amount of heavy elements resulting from the merger remains poorly constrained, mainly due to uncertainties on the mass and angular momentum of the disk formed in the merger remnant. Matter accretion from the disk is also thought to power gamma ray-bursts. We discover from numerical relativity simulations that the accretion disk influences the ringdown gravitational-wave signal produced by binaries that promptly collapse to black-hole at merger. We propose a method to \emph{directly} measure the mass of the accretion disk left during black hole formation in binary mergers using observatories such as the Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer with a relative error of 10\% for binaries at a distance of up to 30~Mpc, corresponding to an event rate of 0.001 to 0.25 events per year.

 - **Abstract**
 We define entropic marginally outer trapped surfaces (E-MOTSs) as a generalization of apparent horizons. We then show that, under first-order perturbations around a stationary black hole, the dynamical black hole entropy proposed by Hollands, Wald, and Zhang, defined on a background Killing horizon, can be expressed as the Wall entropy evaluated on an E-MOTS associated with it. Our result ensures that the Hollands-Wald-Zhang entropy reduces to the standard Wald entropy in each stationary regime of a dynamical black hole, thereby reinforcing the robustness of the dynamical entropy formulation.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the scattering and absorption properties of charged scalar fields on a near-extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole background. We show that in this low-temperature regime the near-horizon throat experiences large quantum fluctuations, whose leading contribution is described by the one dimensional Schwarzian effective action, while the soft $U(1)$ gauge modes can only contribute to subleading order. We investigate the role of the leading quantum effects both inside and outside the superradiant regime. These effects result in an enhanced reflection coefficient within the superradiant regime, while causing a suppression in the non-superradiant regime. On the other hand, the absorption cross-section increases in both regimes. Additional physical features appear as kinks in the reflection coefficient and absorption cross-section plots, corresponding to the shutdown of absorption in the superradiant regime and of stimulated emission in the non-superradiant regime.
