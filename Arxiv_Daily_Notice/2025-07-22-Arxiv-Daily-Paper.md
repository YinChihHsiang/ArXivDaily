 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are singular outbursts of high-energy radiation with durations typically lasting from milliseconds to minutes and, in extreme cases, a few hours. They are attributed to the catastrophic outcomes of stellar-scale events and, as such, are not expected to recur. Here, we present observations of an exceptional GRB\,250702BDE which triggered the {\em Fermi} gamma-ray burst monitor on three occasions over several hours, and which was detected in soft X-rays by the \textit{Einstein Probe} a day before the $\gamma$-ray triggers (EP250702a). We present the discovery of an extremely red infrared counterpart of the event with the VLT, as well as radio observations from MeerKAT. Hubble Space Telescope observations pinpoint the source to a non-nuclear location in a host galaxy with complex morphology, implying GRB 250702BDE is an extragalactic event. The multi-wavelength counterpart is well described with standard afterglow models at a relatively low redshift $z \sim 0.2$, but the prompt emission does not readily fit within the expectations for either collapsar or merger-driven GRBs. Indeed, a striking feature of the multiple prompt outbursts is that the third occurs at an integer multiple of the interval between the first two. Although not conclusive, this could be indicative of periodicity in the progenitor system. We discuss several possible scenarios to explain the exceptional properties of the burst, which suggest that either a very unusual collapsar or the tidal disruption of a white dwarf by an intermediate-mass black hole are plausible explanations for this unprecedented GRB.

#### Modeling the Reverberation Response of the Broad Line Region in Active Galactic Nuclei II: Incorporating Photoionization Models

 - **Abstract**
 The broad emission lines (BELs) emitted by Active Galactic Nuclei respond to variations in the ionizing continuum emission from the accretion disk surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). This reverberation response provides insights into the structure and dynamics of the Broad Line Region (BLR). In Rosborough et al., 2024, we introduced a new forward-modeling tool, the Broad Emission Line MApping Code (BELMAC), which simulates the velocity-resolved reverberation response of the BLR to an input light curve. In this work, we describe a new version of BELMAC, which uses photoionization models to calculate the cloud luminosities for selected BELs. We investigated the reverberation responses of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, MgII$\lambda$2800 and CIV$\lambda$1550 for models representing a disk-like BLR with Keplerian rotation, radiatively driven outflows, and inflows. The line responses generally provide a good indication of the respective luminosity-weighted radii. However, there are situations when the BLR exhibits a negative response to the driving continuum, causing overestimates of the luminosity-weighted radius. The virial mass derived from the models can differ dramatically from the actual SMBH mass, depending mainly on the disk inclination and velocity field. In single zone models, the BELs exhibit similar responses and profile shapes; two-zone models, such as a Keplerian disk and a biconical outflow, can reproduce observed differences between high- and low-ionization lines. Radial flows produce asymmetric line profile shapes due to both anisotropic cloud emission and electron scattering in an inter-cloud medium. These competing attenuation effects complicate the interpretation of profile asymmetries.

 - **Abstract**
 Detecting continuous gravitational waves (CWs) is challenging due to their weak amplitude and high computational demands, especially with poorly constrained source parameters. Stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) searches using cross-correlation techniques can identify unresolved astrophysical sources, including CWs, at lower computational cost, albeit with reduced sensitivity. This motivates a hybrid approach where SGWB algorithms act as a first-pass filter to identify CW candidates for follow-up with dedicated CW pipelines. We evaluated the discovery potential of the SGWB analysis tool PyStoch for detecting CWs, using simulated signals from spinning down NSs. We then applied the method to data from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O3), covering the (20-1726) Hz frequency band, and targeting four supernova remnants: Vela Jr., G347.3-0.5, Cassiopeia A, and the NS associated with the 1987A supernova remnant. If necessary, significant candidates are followed up using the 5-vector Resampling and Band-Sampled Data Frequency-Hough techniques. However, since no interesting candidates were identified in the real O3 analysis, we set 95\% confidence-level upper limits on the CW strain amplitude $h_0$. The most stringent limit was obtained for Cassiopeia A, and is $h_0 = 1.13 \times 10^{-25}$ at $201.57$ Hz with a frequency resolution of $1/32$ Hz. As for the other targets, the best upper limits have been set with the same frequency resolution, and correspond to $h_0 = 1.20 \times 10^{-25} $ at $202.16$ Hz for G347.3-0.5, $1.20 \times 10^{-25}$ at $217.81$ Hz for Vela Jr., and $1.47 \times 10^{-25}$ at $186.41$ Hz for the NS in the 1987A supernova remnant.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass black holes ($3$ $M_\odot \lesssim M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 150$ $M_\odot$) are the natural product of the evolution of heavy stars ($M_{\rm star} \gtrsim 20$ $M_\odot$). In our Galaxy, we expect $10^8$-$10^9$ stellar-mass black holes formed from the gravitational collapse of heavy stars, but currently we know less than 100 objects. We also know $\sim 100$ stellar-mass black holes in other galaxies, most of them discovered by gravitational wave observatories in the past 10 years. The detection of black holes is indeed extremely challenging and possible only in very special cases. This article is a short review on the physics and astrophysics of stellar-mass black holes.

#### Semi-empirical Modeling of Supermassive Black Hole Evolution: Highlighting a possible tension between Demographics and Gravitational Wave Background

 - **Abstract**
 The evolution of the supermassive Black Hole (BH) population across cosmic times remains a central unresolved issue in modern astrophysics, due to the many noticeable uncertainties in the involved physical processes. Here we tackle the problem via a semi-empirical approach with minimal assumptions and data-driven inputs. This is firmly grounded on a continuity plus Smoluchowski equation framework that allows to unitarily describe the two primary modes of BH growth: gas accretion and binary mergers. Key quantities related to the latter processes are incorporated through educated parameterizations, and then constrained in a Bayesian setup from joint observational estimates of the local BH mass function, of the large-scale BH clustering, and of the nano-Hz stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background measured from Pulsar Timimg Array (PTA) experiments. We find that the BH accretion-related parameters are strongly dependent on the local BH mass function determination: higher normalizations and flatter high-mass slopes in the latter imply lower radiative efficiencies and mean Eddington ratios with a stronger redshift evolution. Additionally, the binary BH merger rate is estimated to be a fraction $\lesssim 10^{-1}$ of the galaxy merger rate derived from galaxy pairs counts by JWST, and constrained not to exceed the latter at $\gtrsim 2\sigma$. Relatedly, we highlight hints of a possible tension between current constraints on BH demographics and the interpretation of the nano-Hz GW background as predominantly caused by binary BH mergers. Specifically, we bound the latter's contribution to $\lesssim 30-50\%$ at $\sim 3\sigma$, suggesting that either systematics in the datasets considered here have been underestimated so far, or that additional astrophysical/cosmological sources are needed to explain the residual part of the signal measured by PTA experiments.

#### Eternal inflation near inflection points: a challenge to primordial black hole models

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15522

 - **Abstract**
 Inflation with an inflection point potential is a popular model for producing primordial black holes. The potential near the inflection point is approximately flat, with a local maximum next to a local minimum, prone to eternal inflation. We show that a sufficient condition for eternal inflation is $\lambda_1 \leq 3$, where $\lambda_1$ is the index of the `exponential tail,' the lowest eigenvalue of the Fokker--Planck equation over a bounded region. We write $\lambda_1$ in terms of the model parameters for linear and quadratic regions. Wide quadratic regions inflate eternally if the second slow-roll parameter $\eta_V \geq -6$. We test example models from the literature and show this condition is satisfied; we argue eternal inflation is difficult to avoid in inflection point PBH models. Eternally inflating regions correspond to type II perturbations and form baby universes, hidden behind black hole horizons. These baby universes are inhomogeneous on large scales and dominate the multiverse's total volume. We argue that, if volume weighting is used, eternal inflation makes inflection point primordial black hole models incompatible with large-scale structure observations.

#### Accelerating Universe without dark energy: matter creation after DESI DR2

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15575

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the cosmological matter creation scenario, an alternative approach to both dark energy and modified gravity theories, after the recent DESI DR2-BAO release. We consider that the total matter sector consists of three independently evolving components, namely, radiation, baryons, and dark matter, with the latter being governed by an adiabatic matter creation process that leads to a modified continuity equation. Due to the violation of the standard conservation law, a creation pressure appears, and under a proper choice of dark-matter particle creation rate one can obtain the present accelerating phase as well as the past thermal history of the Universe. We study two specific matter creation rates. By applying the dynamical-system analysis we show that both Model I and Model II can mimic a $\Lambda$CDM-like behavior. Furthermore, we perform a detailed observational confrontation using a series of latest observational datasets including Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) (Pantheon+, DESY5 and Union3 samples) and DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) (DR1 and DR2 samples). In both Model I and Model II we find evidence of matter creation at many standard deviations. Finally, applying the AIC and BIC information criteria we find that Model I is statistically equivalent with $\Lambda$CDM scenario, while Model II shows a mixed picture, namely for most datasets $\Lambda$CDM scenario is favoured, however when DESI data are included matter creation Model II is favoured over $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.

#### Examining the Gap in the Chirp Mass Distribution of Binary Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 The mass distribution of binary black holes inferred from gravitational wave measurements is expected to shed light on their formation scenarios. An emerging structure in the mass distribution indicates the presence of multiple peaks around chirp masses of $8M_\odot$, $14M_\odot$, and $27M_\odot$. In particular, there is a lack of observations between chirp masses of 10 and 12 $M_\odot$. In this letter, we report that observations significantly favour the model supporting suppression of the rate in a narrow chirp mass range compared to the model that doesn't include suppression at a confidence greater than 99.5\%. Using another test, which measures the deviation between the inferred chirp mass distributions from the two models, we conservatively estimate a 95\% confidence in the presence of a feature. A lack of confidence has been reported in the presence of a gap around a comparable location in the component mass distribution. The differing conclusions are due to a unique correlation between the primary~(heavier of the two masses) and the secondary~(lighter of the two masses) masses of binary black holes. This correlation results in increased clustering of measured chirp masses around specific values.

 - **Abstract**
 Environmental effects within cosmological overdensities, such as galaxy groups and clusters, have been shown to impact galaxies and their cold gas reservoirs and thereby provide constraints on galaxy evolution models. Galaxy groups foster frequent galaxy-galaxy interactions, making them rich environments in which to study galaxy transformation. In this work, we study a serendipitously discovered large overdensity of HI galaxies at z~0.04. The galaxies appear to lie in a filamentary-like structure of megaparsec scale. MeerKAT's angular resolution and field of view allow us to spatially resolve the HI galaxies while simultaneously probing large-scale structure. The HI and sub-arcsec Dark Energy Survey (DES) imaging reveal a large number of interacting galaxies in this collective group. MeerKAT data enables us to derive HI masses and investigate interacting galaxies. We use DES and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data to quantify the star formation rates, stellar masses, and stellar morphologies of member galaxies and compare these with field scaling relations. To place this discovery and the environmental effects in context, we use the SIMBA simulation to investigate the prevalence of qualitatively similar HI overdensities and their large-scale morphological properties. This enables a prediction of how frequently such structures might be serendipitously discovered with MeerKAT and SKA-Mid HI observations in comparable observation time. The combination of spatially resolved HI data and optical imaging reveals a group rich in interactions, suggesting environmental processes are already shaping galaxy properties within the structure. More of these serendipitous discoveries are expected and, alongside ongoing targeted programmes, these will provide a rich sample to study galaxy transformation and enable a MeerKAT HI perspective on large-scale structure, including filaments.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15701

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the possibility that the recently reported GW231123 event, with component masses $M_1=137^{+22}_{-17}\,M_\odot$, $M_2=103^{+20}_{-52}\,M_\odot$ and a local merger rate $R_{\mathrm{local}}=0.08^{+0.19}_{-0.07}\,\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$, originates from primordial black holes (PBHs) formed during an early matter-dominated era. We compute the PBH mass function, abundance, spin distribution and the merger rate density and find a set of choices for the parameters to reproduce the key properties of GW231123. We also show that the resulting PBH abundance, $f_{\mathrm{pbh}}= 1.64^{+5.00}_{-1.59}\times10^{-1}$, is at the border of the exclusion regions, but still remains self-consistent. Finally, we estimate the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) that are inevitably generated during PBH formation. PBHs that interpret GW231123 are accompanied by negligible SIGWs in the nano-hertz band, indicating no conflict with current pulsar timing arrays data.

#### Simulating a Gaussian stochastic gravitational wave background signal in pulsar timing arrays

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15756

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the theoretical modeling and simulation of a Gaussian stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signal in a pulsar timing array (PTA). We show that the correlation between Fourier components of pulsar timing residuals can be expressed using transfer functions; that are indicative of characteristic temporal correlations in a SGWB signal observed in a finite time window. These transfer functions, when convolved with the SGWB power spectrum and spatial correlation (Hellings \& Downs curve), describe the variances and correlations of the pulsar timing residuals' Fourier coefficients. The convolutions are the exact frequency- and Fourier-domain representations of the time-domain covariance function. We derive explicit forms for the transfer functions for unpolarized and circularly polarized SGWB signals. We validate our results by comparing Gaussian theoretical expectation values with standard simulations based on point sources and our own covariance-matrix-based approach. The unified frequency- and Fourier-domain formalism provides a robust foundation for future PTA precision analyses and highlights the importance of temporal correlations in interpreting GW signals.

#### Spectral analysis of ultraluminous X-ray pulsars with models of X-ray pulsars

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15764

 - **Abstract**
 A fraction of the Ultra Luminous X-ray (ULX) sources are known to be accreting neutron stars as they show coherent X-ray pulsations with pulse periods ranging from ~1-30 seconds. While initially thought to host intermediate-mass black holes, ULXs have since been recognized as a diverse class of objects, including ULX pulsars. These pulsars require models specifically tailored to account for their unique accretion physics, distinct from those used for Galactic black hole binaries. The X-ray spectra of all Galactic accreting X-ray pulsars (including sources in the Magellanic Clouds) are dominated by a high energy cut-off power-law and some of the sources show a soft excess, some emission lines, cyclotron absorption features, etc. In this work, we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the broadband X-ray spectra of five ULX pulsars using simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations and show that their X-ray spectra can be effectively described by spectral models, similar to those used for the local accretion-powered X-ray pulsars. A soft excess is detected in all the sources which is also consistent with the local X-ray pulsars that have low absorption column density. We have marginal detection or low upper limit on the presence of the iron K-alpha emission line from these sources, which is a key difference of the ULX pulsars with the local accreting X-ray pulsars. We discuss the implication of this on the nature of the binary companion and the accretion mechanism in the ULX pulsars.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) is one of the most challenging tasks for both current and next-generation detectors. Successfully distinguishing the SGWB from instrumental noise and environmental effects requires accurate and flexible analysis tools capable of detecting the signal and determining its origin. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework and a user-friendly tool for SGWB characterization: \texttt{GWBird} (Gravitational Wave Background Inventory of Response functions for Detectors). This code enables the computation of overlap reduction functions (ORFs), power-law integrated sensitivity curves (PLS), angular response functions, and angular PLS (APLS). It supports the full range of gravitational wave polarization modes (tensor, scalar, and vector), allowing for the characterization of both isotropic and anisotropic SGWB components for all the polarizations. Additionally, the code includes functions for circular polarization characterization, which is particularly relevant for probing parity-violating signals. The framework integrates analyses for ground-based, space-based, and Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) detectors, offering a versatile framework for SGWB analysis. The \texttt{GWBird} code is publicly available at:~\github{this https URL}

#### A new parametric observational study of $f(Q,B)$ gravity with modified chaplygin gas

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14251

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14251

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we explore the cosmological dynamics of a modified gravity framework based on the function $f(Q,B)=\delta Q^{2}+\beta B$, where $Q$ denotes the nonmetricity scalar and $B$ is the boundary term that relates $Q$ to the Ricci scalar. The matter sector is modeled using the Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG) with the equation of state $p=A\rho-\frac{B}{\rho^{\alpha}}$, allowing the model to interpolate between early-time matter behavior and late-time cosmic acceleration. By deriving an analytical expression for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, we perform a parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques in conjunction with the latest cosmological observations: $46$ Hubble parameter measurements, $15$ BAO data points, DESI DR2 BAO data and the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae compilation. The best-fit values are obtained as $H_0 = 72.22^{+3.64}_{-4.46}$, $A_s = 0.696^{+0.082}_{-0.129}$, $\alpha = 0.0029^{+0.022}_{-0.021}$, and $A = 0.0038^{+0.071}_{-0.047}$. The deceleration parameter transitions at redshift $z_{tr} \approx 0.946$, while the present-day value is $q_0 = -0.789$. The model yields an age of the Universe $t_0 \approx 13.53$ Gyr and a present EoS parameter $\omega_0 \approx -0.691$, which reflects the late-time acceleration consistent with observational bounds. These results demonstrate that the MCG scenario within $f(Q,B)$ gravity provides a viable and observationally consistent framework for explaining the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the quantum signature of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), a region of profound importance in black hole astrophysics. By modeling an atom as an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a massless scalar field in the Boulware vacuum, we calculate the excitation rate for a detector following a circular geodesic at the ISCO of a Schwarzschild black hole. In stark contrast to the continuous thermal spectra associated with static or infalling observers, our analysis reveals a unique, non-thermal excitation spectrum characterized by a discrete "frequency comb" of sharp, resonant peaks. We show that the locations of these peaks are determined by the orbital frequency at the ISCO, while their intensity increases dramatically as the orbit approaches this final stability boundary. This distinct spectral signature offers a novel theoretical probe of the quantum vacuum in a strong-field gravitational regime and provides a clear distinction between the quantum phenomena experienced by observers on different trajectories. Our findings have potential implications for interpreting the emission spectra from accretion disks and open new avenues for exploring the connection between quantum mechanics and gravity.

#### Accretion Disk Luminosity and Topological Characteristics for a Schwarzschild Black Hole Surrounded by a Hernquist Dark Matter Halo

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study some characteristics and gravitational signatures of the Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a Hernquist dark matter halo (SBH-HDM). We determine the black hole's remnant radius and mass, which provide useful residual information at the end of its evaporation. We then explore the luminosity of the accretion disk from the SBH-HDM model. In this way, we determine the key orbital parameters of the test particles within the accretion disk, such as angular velocity, angular momentum, energy, and the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit, based on the dark matter model parameters. We also numerically estimate the accretion disk's efficiency in converting matter into radiation. We also demonstrate that dark matter, which significantly alters the geometry surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole, influences the accretion disk's radiative flux, temperature, differential luminosity, and spectral luminosity. The stability of a black hole spacetime is determined in the eikonal regime. The Lyapunov exponent is also analyzed to quantify the stability of the particle regime and to demonstrate the infall into or escape from the black hole to infinity, as well as the quasi-normal modes. Finally, some properties of black holes are studied from a topological perspective.

#### Perturbative emergent modified gravity on cosmological backgrounds: Kinematics

 - **Abstract**
 Emergent modified gravity has shown that the canonical formulation of general relativity gives rise to a larger class of covariant modifications than action-based approaches, so far in symmetry-reduced models. This outcome is made possible by distinguishing between the space-time metric on a given solution, and the basic field degrees of freedom in which equations of motion are formulated. In this general treatment, the metric is no longer fundamental but emerges after field equations and covariance conditions are solved. Here, the results are extended to perturbative inhomogeneity on a spatially flat cosmological background, showing that new modifications are possible while maintaining the classical derivative order and setting the stage for dynamical equations suitable for detailed studies of early-universe models.

#### Topological classification of black holes surrounded by quintessence

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we consider a class of black hole solutions surrounded by quintessence as defects possessing topological characteristics within the thermodynamic space. By formulating a generalized off-shell free energy and calculating the winding number for each black hole branch through the residues of isolated first-order poles of characteristic function defined by this free energy, the winding number reflects the local properties of black holes. The topological number, being the sum of winding numbers for all black hole branches, reflects global properties. Utilizing the residue method, we discovered that the topological numbers for Schwarzschild, Kerr, and Kerr-AdS black holes surrounded by quintessence are consistent with those not surrounded by quintessence. Furthermore, 4D/5D Einstein-Gauss Bonnet black holes under a quintessence field belong to the same topological class as Kerr black holes. Thus both the rotation parameter and Gauss-Bonnet parameter in this background field affect the topological number of the black hole. Importantly, the winding numbers for generation and annihilation points can be calculated using the residues of second-order poles of the characteristic function.

 The Event Horizon Telescope's 2024 observations report a shift in the position angle of the brightness asymmetry in M87*, revealing time variability in the black hole's image. In this analysis, we investigate the time-dependent of a Vaidya black hole. By introducing a mass function that increases linearly with time, along with a conformal transformation, we derive the conformal Vaidya metric and define a new time coordinate $t_c$. Using the semi-analytical approach, we analyze the ray trajectories and radiation flux of the Vaidya black hole in the background of a thin accretion disk. We discuss how the observed flux in the Vaidya spacetime evolves as a function of the new time coordinate $t_c$. The results show that the facula on the observable plane undergoes radial displacement as $t_c$ increases, revealing the time-dependent evolution of black hole images.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical compact objects are studied in the context of quadratic non-metricity gravity. The solutions to the gravitational field equations, which include fluid components, are analyzed to investigate the density and pressure properties of radio pulsars. It is explicitly demonstrated that the theoretically stable models are consistent with astronomical data, due to the geometric features of the quadratic component. Furthermore, it is shown that, in contrast to the compactness limits of black holes in general relativity, the core density can significantly exceed the density at which nuclear saturation occurs, and the surface density can also surpass the value of nuclear saturation. Additionally, it is found that the radial sound speed remains below the conformal upper bound for sound velocity established by perturbative quantum chromodynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse how different Generalised Uncertainty Principles could place bounds on the compactness of self-gravitating systems. By considering existing experimental bounds on the relevant parameters, we conclude that the compactness of large astrophysical objects is bounded above by the inverse of the GUP parameter, which would naturally be of order one. Conversely, the existence of black holes imposes stronger bounds on those parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Wormholes are non-trivial topological structures that arise as exact solutions to Einstein's field equations, theoretically connecting distinct regions of spacetime via a throat-like geometry. While static traversable wormholes necessarily require exotic matter that violates the classical energy conditions, subsequent studies have sought to minimize such violations by introducing time-dependent geometries embedded within cosmological backgrounds. This review provides a comprehensive survey of evolving wormhole solutions, emphasizing their formulation within both general relativity and alternative theories of gravity. We explore key developments in the construction of non-static wormhole spacetimes, including those conformally related to static solutions, as well as dynamically evolving geometries influenced by scalar fields. Particular attention is given to the wormholes embedded into Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes and de Sitter backgrounds, where the interplay between the cosmic expansion and wormhole dynamics is analyzed. We also examine the role of modified gravity theories, especially in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, which enable the realization of traversable wormholes supported by effective stress-energy tensors that do not violate the null or weak energy conditions. By systematically analyzing a wide range of time-dependent wormhole solutions, this review identifies the specific geometric and physical conditions under which wormholes can evolve consistently with the null and weak energy conditions. These findings clarify how such configurations can be naturally integrated into cosmological models governed by general relativity or modified gravity, thereby contributing to a deeper theoretical understanding of localized spacetime structures in an expanding universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Probing extra polarizations in gravitational waves (GWs) with space-based detectors is the most direct method for testing theories of gravity. In this paper, by employing the second-generation time-delay interferometry (TDI) to cancel out the laser frequency noise in a rotating and flexing configuration with arm lengths varying linearly in time, we study the detectors' constraint ability on extra polarizations, and explore the impacts of TDI on the constraint of polarizations. Working in the parametrized post-Einstein (ppE) waveform framework, we find that the constraints on extra polarizations are significantly weaker than those for the tensor mode. For the tensor mode, the constraint ability for the detectors scales with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). At low frequency, due to signal cancellation effects, the SNR registered is lower for the detectors with TDI method than that with the simplified equal-arm Michelson interferometer method. Therefore, tensor-mode constraints are degraded when TDI is applied. Although the direct detection of extra polarizations remains challenging, the constraint ability of the space-based detectors on the vector mode is better than the scalar modes. Besides, the detectability on extra polarizations will be enhanced with TDI, and the improvement of the constraint on the vector mode is less than scalar modes due to the inclination-dependent waveforms.

#### General form for Pseudo-Newtonian Potentials, imitating Schwarzschild geodesics

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new, general form for a pseudo-Newtonian gravitational potential (PNP), expressed as a series of Paczyński-Wiita-like functions with the addition of increasing negative powers of $r$ with arbitrary coefficients. We present a procedure for determining these coefficients to construct a custom PNP that replicates key features of Schwarzschild geodesics for a test particle near a black hole. As an example, we construct potentials set to reproduce (I) the presence of an innermost stable circular orbit at the $r=6$ (geometric units), with the correct infall velocity for small deviations (on the geodesic universal infall), (II) the periapsis advance at large distances, and (III) the presence of a marginally bound circular orbit with specific angular momentum $L=4$, and the periapsis advance of parabolic orbits close to it. We compare the performance of our examples against the Paczyński-Wiita potential and other existing potentials. Finally, we discuss the limitations and advantages of our formulation.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultralight scalars can form superradiant clouds around rotating black holes. These may alter the dynamics of compact binaries and the ensuing waveform through orbital resonances and cloud ionization. We re-examine resonances involving states with nonzero decay width, deriving an effective treatment for resonances that are wider than the binary's frequency chirp. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by calculating an upper bound for the cloud's mass surviving up to the latest stages of the inspiral. Next, we study the accumulation of resonances with high-energy bound states. When these infinitely many, increasingly weak resonances are properly taken into account, they smooth out the "sharp features" in the binary's evolution that had been attributed to the ionization of the cloud. We compare our Newtonian results with recent relativistic calculations, highlighting common features as well as discrepancies. Our conclusions emphasize the need to carefully incorporate resonances in boson cloud waveform modeling.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a new dark energy (DE) model from four parameter generalized entropy function of apparent horizon in a spatially flat universe. Such kind of generalized entropy is able to generalize all the known entropies proposed so far, for suitable representations of the entropic parameters. It turns out that the scenario can describe the correct thermal history of the universe, with the sequence of matter and dark energy epochs. Comparing with the $\Lambda$CDM model, the proposed generalized entropic DE model provides a higher value of present Hubble parameter for certain range of entropic parameter(s) leading to a possible resolution of Hubble tension issue. We confront the scenario with CC, PantheonPlus+SH0ES, DESI DR1 and compressed Planck likelihood datasets, which clearly depicts the phenomenological viability of the present model for some best fitted values of entropic parameter(s) that are indeed consistent with the resolution of Hubble tension.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the deflection angle of light rays confined to the equatorial plane of a Hairy Kiselev black hole. The analysis includes a thorough study of the horizon structure and critical parameters, leading to an analytic expression for the deflection angle in terms of elliptic integrals. Our results confirm that the deflection angle decreases with increasing impact parameter, in agreement with classical predictions of gravitational lensing. The influence of the scalar field, characterized by the coupling constant, shows a nontrivial effect: while moderate values of the coupling constant initially enhance light bending, further increases lead to a suppression of the deflection in the strong-field regime due to modifications in spacetime geometry. Comparative analysis among the Schwarzschild, Kiselev, and Hairy Kiselev black holes indicates that the presence of a quintessential field tends to enhance the deflection, whereas the scalar hair component reduces it. These findings underscore the significant role of scalar fields and exotic matter distributions in shaping light propagation in a modified gravity scenario.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study the spectrum of the Regge poles (RPs), which are the counterparts of quasinormal modes, in a draining bathtub vortex within a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) system. We study the gapped excitations of the condensate with the spatially dependent energy gap term using a spatially tunable Rabi coupling, which will be treated as a perturbation. This model serves as an analogue of a rotating black hole surrounded by an environmental mass shell. We first compute the semiclassical scattering amplitude with the spatially independent mass effect due to the orbital interference. In the case of the mass-shell, bifurcation of the spectrum is observed, resulting in the destabilization of the RPs. We also study the migration of RPs by shifting the bump position. Our results show that the RPs of the co-rotating modes exhibit greater stability than those of the counter-rotating modes. Large migration and overtaking jumps of the overtone (fundamental RP) leave an imprint on the scattering amplitude at small (large) scattering angles. This can be observed in the scattering interference pattern in experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 Accurate and reliable gravitational waveform models are crucial in determining the properties of compact binary mergers. In particular, next-generation gravitational-wave detectors will require more accurate waveforms to avoid biases in the analysis. In this work, we extend the recent NRTidalv3 model to account for higher-mode corrections in the tidal phase contributions for binary neutron star systems. The higher-mode, multipolar NRTidalv3 model is then attached to several binary-black-hole baselines, such as the phenomenological IMRPhenomXHM and IMRPhenomXPHM models, and the effective-one-body-based model SEOBNRv5HM_ROM. We test the performance and validity of the newly developed models by comparing them with numerical-relativity simulations and other tidal models. Finally, we employ them in parameter estimation analyses on simulated signals from both comparable-mass and high-mass-ratio systems, as well as on the gravitational-wave event GW170817, for which we find consistent results with respect to previous analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 Lunar time metrology necessitates a unified temporal framework beyond Earth, requiring an independent lunar system for timekeeping, dissemination, and calendrics. Recent American publications define Lunar Coordinate Time (LTC) within relativity and propose a Terrestrial Time (TT) to LTC conversion formula. However, this formula's derivation and assumptions are contested. The complex dynamics within the solar system can be simplified by decomposing relationships into hierarchical wide-area (external problem) and local-area (internal problem) levels. Grounded in the symmetry and conservation laws of physics, Einstein's general relativity emphasizes two key principles: (i) Equal weighting: Relationships among multi-level coordinate systems are independent and self-similar (analogous to fractals). (ii) *Locality*: The laws of physics retain invariant forms only in local coordinate systems. Specifically, a non-rotating system corresponds to the Frenet frame along a particle's geodesic. Preserving physical law invariance requires restricting rotating references strictly to the local domain; defining the orientation of an Earth-centered system using distant celestial bodies violates general relativity's locality principle. This work derives the relationship between coordinate time and proper time. Using the Earth-Moon system as an intermediary, it obtains a simplified transformation formula between LTC and TT. An independent and universal lunar standard time framework is proposed. Crucially, the derived coordinate time transformation coefficient exhibits long-term secular variation. This variation can be measured and predicted through precise Earth-Moon time comparisons.

#### Can Static Black Holes in Massive Gravity Serve as Candidates for Aschenbach-Like Phenomena?

 - **Abstract**
 The Aschenbach effect is widely regarded as a manifestation of two quintessential relativistic features: frame dragging and extreme spacetime curvature. Traditionally associated with rotating geometries, this non-monotonic behavior in orbital angular velocity challenges Newtonian intuition. In our previous work, however, we demonstrated that this velocity irregularity is not exclusive to spinning spacetimes. Specifically, we showed that the presence of a stable minimum in the gravitational potential, corresponding to a stable photon sphere, can reproduce Aschenbach-like behavior in static black holes as well. This observation suggests that, even in the absence of rotational frame dragging, curvature alone (if encoded through appropriate geometric extrema) may be sufficient to induce non-monotonic velocity profiles. In this study, we build upon that foundation to investigate whether black hole architectures in theories of Massive Gravity can inherently support the emergence of Aschenbach-like phenomena. Furthermore, can this Aschenbach-like phenomenon in static configurations be considered as an observable signature in the dynamics of general relativity, similar to the original Aschenbach effect in rotating spacetimes?

 In this third work in a series, we prove the local-in-time well-posedness of the IBVP for the vacuum Einstein equations in general relativity with twisted DIrichlet boundary conditions on a finite timelike boundary. The boundary conditions consist of specification of the pointwise conformal class of the boundary metric, together with a scalar density involving a combination of the volume form of the bulk metric restricted to the boundary together with the volume form of the boundary metric itself.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme mass ratio inspirals, compact objects spiraling into massive black holes, represent key sources for future space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as LISA. The inspirals will occur within rich astrophysical environments containing gravitating matter. Motivated by this, we develop a fully relativistic framework for inspirals under the gravitational influence of matter environments. Our approach employs a two-parameter perturbation expansion in the mass ratio and an environmental parameter. This yields a modified Teukolsky equation capturing the leading cross-order. We then implement a simple pole-dipole approximation of an axisymmetric environment through a thin matter shell and restrict to non-rotating black holes. As a result, we obtain a piecewise type D spacetime. This enables the use of Teukolsky-based methods while accounting for junction physics. The presence of the matter shell leads to effectively non-separable boundary conditions for the Teukolsky scalar and introduces mode mixing between adjacent multipoles. Additionally, the shell oscillates under the wave perturbation of the inspiral, contributing to the overall flux. The framework provides novel insights into the global dynamics of gravitational radiation in tidal environments. Furthermore, it represents a complete theoretical foundation for a future computation of inspirals and waveforms in our environmental model.

 - **Abstract**
 We present GravLensX, an innovative method for rendering black holes with gravitational lensing effects using neural networks. The methodology involves training neural networks to fit the spacetime around black holes and then employing these trained models to generate the path of light rays affected by gravitational lensing. This enables efficient and scalable simulations of black holes with optically thin accretion disks, significantly decreasing the time required for rendering compared to traditional methods. We validate our approach through extensive rendering of multiple black hole systems with superposed Kerr metric, demonstrating its capability to produce accurate visualizations with significantly $15\times$ reduced computational time. Our findings suggest that neural networks offer a promising alternative for rendering complex astrophysical phenomena, potentially paving a new path to astronomical visualization.

 One of the major problems in quantum gravity research is the lack of signals at the reach of present or near-future experimental facilities. In this paper, we show that this is not the case. Contrary to previous claims, the quantum decay of de Sitter space into black hole spacetimes can be significant even after inflation and can be observed on galactic scales. Using the instanton formalism within the no-boundary proposal for a class of short-scale, quantum-gravity-improved black holes, we show that de Sitter space decay would result in the production of $10^{60}$ stable Planck-size black hole remnants within the current Hubble horizon, which is the number required to explain dark matter.

 We investigate the inflation for the quartic hilltop model via a certain type of modified gravity. Precisely, we analyze the $F(\phi) T$ term in the Einstein's gravity to examine the quartic hilltop inflation model. $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and $\phi$ is the inflaton field. Next, we calculate the inflation dynamics for the foregoing model and obtain the slow-roll parameters, i.e., the scalar spectral index ``$n_s$'' and the tensor-to-scale ratio ``$r$'', which these parameters exhibit high sensitivity to the $F(\phi) T$ term. This modified form of the gravity is not only in accordance with the predictions of the original model but also allows for better prediction of the Planck/BICEP/Keck data.
