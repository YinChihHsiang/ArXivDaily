#### The fate of the failed supernova candidate M31-2014-DS1

 - **Abstract**
 The fate of massive stars above 20M$_{\odot}$ remains uncertain. Debate persists about whether they die as supernovae (SNe), or if they collapse directly into black holes (BHs) with little or no optical outburst -- so-called ``failed supernovae''. The source M31-2014-DS1 experienced an optical outburst in 2014 and has remained faint at visual wavelengths since then. Due to its persistent faintness, it has been proposed as a failed SN candidate. We present new observations of this candidate obtained using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the Submillimeter Array (SMA), and Chandra. The JWST observations demonstrate that a luminous mid-infrared source persists at the same location a decade after the star faded at visual wavelengths. We model its current spectral energy distribution (SED) as a dust-enshrouded star. No X-ray emission is detected, disfavoring the hypothesis that the late-time luminosity is powered by accretion onto a BH. We find that the remaining source is highly obscured by an asymmetric distribution of circumstellar dust, making it difficult to quantify its physical properties using spherically symmetric radiative transfer codes. The dust geometry requires that the inferred bolometric luminosity is only a lower limit, as a significant fraction of the central source's radiation may escape without being reprocessed by dust. We discuss the implications of these findings in the context of failed SN models and consider the potential overlap with signatures expected from a stellar merger, which also seems to provide a plausible explanation of this source.

 - **Abstract**
 Despite early theoretical expectations that large-scale, massive outflows would be triggered by accretion onto black holes and neutron stars, their presence was not firmly established until the 2000s. Since then, they have been recognised as a common, perhaps ubiquitous, feature of accretion discs in X-ray binaries. Over the past two decades, our understanding of these outflows has expanded significantly, with their associated phenomenology now observed across the X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared regimes. In this review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the observational properties of both low- and high-ionisation winds, treating each separately as well as part of a broader phenomenon, and place these findings in the context of current theoretical modelling. We discuss their close connection with disc atmospheres, their impact on the accretion process, and their role within the broader framework that includes the radio jet and the different accretion flow configurations and states. We also address current challenges and outline some of the anticipated developments, particularly those linked to upcoming observational facilities.

#### Probing General Relativity on Cosmological Scales in the 2040s

 - **Abstract**
 General relativity is exquisitely tested in strong-field regimes, yet its validity on cosmological scales remains largely unexplored. Upcoming wide and deep large-scale structure surveys will access the ultra-large, linear scales where relativistic effects - Doppler terms, gravitational redshift, lensing magnification, and potential evolution - leave significant imprints in the clustering of galaxies. These signatures represent unique probes of spacetime that are inaccessible to standard Newtonian analyses but increasingly important as survey volumes grow. We outline the scientific potential of next-generation facilities, such as those envisioned within ESO's Expanding Horizons programme, to deliver the first robust measurements of relativistic effects in large-scale structure through multi-tracer power spectra and the single-tracer bispectrum of high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies. Detecting these contributions would open a new window on gravity, enabling precision tests of general relativity and its alternatives on cosmological scales in the 2040s.

#### Cosmic wallflowers: the circumgalactic origins of isolated ultra-compact star clusters at $z>7$

 - **Abstract**
 The discovery of gravitationally lensed stellar clusters at high redshift with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed extremely compact, massive star-forming systems in galaxies at $z > 6$, providing a new window into early cluster formation. In this work, we investigate star cluster formation in the circumgalactic environments of gas-rich galaxies with stellar masses spanning between $\sim$$10^{8}$ - $10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ at $z > 7$, using the MassiveBlackPS cosmological hydrodynamical simulation with 2 pc resolution. We identify 55 baryon-dominated clusters forming outside galactic discs but within the virial radius of the primary halo. Star formation in these systems proceeds rapidly, reaching peak stellar surface densities above $10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$, closely matching the compact clusters recently discovered by JWST in the lensed Cosmic Gems Arc at $z \approx 9.6$. Such extreme densities are a key pre-requisite to trigger runaway stellar collisions, indicating that a subset of our clusters would be a likely host of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We find that massive star clusters can form efficiently in the circumgalactic medium at early times through filament fragmentation, whereby high gas densities lead to rapid local collapse via a combination of thermal and gravitational instabilities. This formation pathway implies that some compact clusters formed in the quiet outskirts of forming galaxies rather than within their discs. Small variations in filament properties, including metallicity, density, and dark-matter content, influence the likelihood of a star cluster being able to form an IMBH seed. The formation of clusters in circumgalactic environments points to a potential evolutionary pathway connecting early off-disc clusters, present-day globular clusters, and the seeds of massive BHs.

#### A microphysically inspired approach to dark matter-dark energy interactions: first bounds on dark-sector scattering cross sections

 - **Abstract**
 The observational tension regarding the value of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) has motivated the exploration of alternative cosmological scenarios, including Interacting Dark Energy models. However, the majority of IDE models studied in the literature rely on phenomenological interaction terms proportional to the Hubble parameter (e.g., $Q\propto H\rho$), which lack a clear microphysical justification and often suffer from large-scale instabilities. In this work, we propose and investigate a "bottom-up" IDE model where the interaction is formulated directly from particle physics collision processes, taking the form $Q\propto\rho^2$. This interaction represents a reversible annihilation/creation process between Dark Matter and Dark Energy, motivated by the Boltzmann equation. We test this model against a combination of background cosmological data, Pantheon Plus, Cosmic Chronometers, DESI DR2, and CMB distance priors from Planck18. We find that the model is consistent with the data, yielding a Hubble constant of $H_0=67.71\pm0.65$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for the combined analysis. The dimensionless interaction rate coefficients are constrained to be small, with upper limits of $A < 7.586\times10^{-25}$ (for Dark Matter self annihilation) and $B < 0.048$ (for Dark Energy self annihilation) at 95\% confidence level. Since the interaction model is parameterized by the expansion rate, these bounds on $H_0$, $A$, and $B$ directly translate into a strict limit on the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section per unit of mass. The constraints on the coupling $A$ imply that, if such a collisional interaction exists, the effective dark-matter annihilation cross section per unit mass is highly suppressed relative to the cosmological expansion rate. In contrast, the corresponding dark-energy contribution, governed by $B$, is only constrained at the level of a few percent in dimensionless units.

 - **Abstract**
 Binaries occur in many astrophysical systems, from young protostellar binaries in star forming regions to supermassive black hole binaries in galaxy centers. In many cases, a circumbinary disk of gas forms around the binary with an orbit that may be misaligned to the binary plane. Misaligned disks around nearly circular binaries evolve into disks that are either aligned or counteraligned with the binary orbit. However, if the binary is sufficiently eccentric, then it can be more likely that the disk ends up in a polar-aligned configuration in which the disk angular momentum vector aligns with the binary eccentricity vector. We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations, evolved to an approximate steady state under mass injection, to determine the orbital evolution of a binary with a polar-aligned disk for a range of binary-disk parameters. We find that, in all of the cases we have simulated, the binary shrinks with time. The decay rate is larger than for binaries surrounded by aligned or retrograde disks with matched disk parameters. The rate of shrinkage is largely unaltered by the size of the sink radii employed for the binary stars, but for small enough sink radii some of the models exhibit long-lived polar circumprimary disks, which are continually fed mass from the circumbinary disk. We discuss our results in the contexts of planet formation in young polar-aligned disks and merging supermassive black holes in galaxy centers.

#### Marked statistics across the cosmic web: Environmental dependent clustering in modified gravity simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We study environment-dependent clustering using the marked correlation function applied to Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ modified gravity simulations. This gravity theory enriches the structure formation by enhancing gravity in a scale-dependent form. By employing a multi-scale cosmic structure finder algorithm, we define the cosmic environments divided in: nodes, filaments, walls and voids. We find a stronger impact of modified gravity in nodes and filament, which together dominate the information content by more than a factor of four relative to other environments. Combining environmental information further enhances the expected signal-to-noise ratio for CMASS- and DESI-like mock samples, particularly in configurations including filaments. Overall, marked correlation functions that incorporate environmental structure increase the information content by about a factor of two compared to standard density-based marks applied to the full galaxy sample. These results demonstrate the importance of environmental information, especially from filaments, in improving the constraining power of galaxy clustering tests of modified gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars, a type of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with relativistic jets pointed at the observer, exhibit flux variability across the electromagnetic spectrum due to particle acceleration in their jets. Power spectral density (PSD) studies show breaks at specific frequencies, particularly in X-rays, linked to the accretion regime and black hole mass. However, very-high-energy gamma-ray PSD breaks remain unexplored due to current instrument limitations. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), with up to ten times greater sensitivity compared to current generation instruments, will allow precise PSD reconstruction and unprecedented study of blazar flares. These flares reveal key insights into particle acceleration, photon production, and jet properties. The AGN monitoring and flare programs in CTAO's Key Science Project aim to deepen our understanding of blazar emissions.

#### VENUS: Two Faint Little Red Dots Separated by $\sim70\,\mathrm{pc}$ Hidden in a Single Lensed Galaxy at $z\sim7$

 - **Abstract**
 We report the identification of a pair of faint little red dots (LRDs), dubbed Red Eyes, in a strongly-lensed galaxy at $z\sim7$ behind the PLCKG004.5-10.5 cluster, identified from the JWST Treasury program VENUS. Red Eyes are spatially resolved on the image plane with distinct colors, while the critical curve lies far north of Red Eyes, clearly requiring two different LRDs rather than a single LRD. Red Eyes is an extremely close pair of LRDs separated by $\sim70\,\mathrm{pc}$ in the source plane with a magnification of $\mu\sim20$, which consistently explains another counter-image detected to the north-west. Red Eyes is hosted in a typical star-forming galaxy with $M_{\mathrm{UV,int}}\sim -19$, but its own UV emission is very faint ($M_{\mathrm{UV,int}} \gtrsim -16$). Moreover, Red Eyes does not reside at the galaxy center but lies at an offset position of approximately one effective radius $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ away from the galaxy center. If observed without lensing, Red Eyes would appear as a typical star-forming galaxy at $z\sim 7$ with $M_{\mathrm{UV}}\sim -19$, showing no apparent LRD signatures in either morphology or SED. These results suggest that multiple off-center LRDs, similar to Red Eyes, may be commonly hidden in a typical high-$z$ star-forming galaxy. In this case, various plausible scenarios may emerge, one of which is that intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with $M_\mathrm{BH}\sim10^{4\text{--}6}\,M_\odot$ may form in star clusters on a stellar disk and contribute to the growth of the central supermassive black hole via mergers, with some IMBHs detectable as luminous LRDs in a sufficiently active and massive phase.

 - **Abstract**
 Over the next two decades, gravitational-wave (GW) observations are expected to evolve from a discovery-driven endeavour into a precision tool for astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. Current second-generation ground-based detectors have established the existence of compact-binary mergers and enabled GW multi-messenger astronomy, but they remain limited in sensitivity, redshift reach, frequency coverage, and duty cycle. These limitations prevent them from addressing many fundamental open questions in cosmology. By the 2040s, wide-field electromagnetic surveys will have mapped the luminous Universe with unprecedented depth and accuracy. Nevertheless, key problems including the nature of dark matter, the physical origin of cosmic acceleration, the properties of gravity on cosmological scales, and the physical conditions of the earliest moments after the Big Bang will remain only partially constrained by electromagnetic observations alone. Progress on these fronts requires access to physical processes and epochs that do not emit light. Gravitational waves provide a unique and complementary observational channel: they propagate over cosmological distances largely unaffected by intervening matter, probe extreme astrophysical environments, and respond directly to the geometry of spacetime. In this context, next-generation GW observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) will be transformative for European astronomy. Operating at sensitivities and frequencies beyond existing detectors, ET will observe binary black holes and neutron stars out to previously inaccessible redshifts, enable continuous high signal-to-noise monitoring of compact sources, and detect gravitational-wave backgrounds of astrophysical and cosmological origin. Together with space-based detectors, ET will play a central role in advancing our understanding of cosmic evolution and fundamental physics.

#### Weak lensing of bright standard sirens: prospects for $σ_8$

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave events with electromagnetic counterparts provide direct measurements of the Hubble diagram. We demonstrate that incorporating weak lensing into bright standard siren analyses allows measurements of cosmological parameters that do not influence the mean luminosity distance-redshift relation but do impact the cosmic structures. In particular, we examine the prospects for measuring the standard deviation of matter perturbations $\sigma_8$, in addition to the Hubble constant and the matter abundance. We find that a $10\%$ measurement of $\sigma_8$ would be feasible with ET, provided a population of $300$ neutron star binaries with electromagnetic counterparts is observed. With LISA, the measurement of $\sigma_8$ would have $30\%$ accuracy, assuming a population of $12$ massive black hole binaries with electromagnetic counterparts is observed.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe and may account for all or part of the dark matter. In this review, we summarize the current observational constraints on PBHs across the full mass range, highlight potential evidence for their existence, and outline the prospects for future searches, particularly with gravitational-wave observatories. We also discuss different PBH formation scenarios, identify the corresponding mass functions, and present the observational constraints in each case.

 - **Abstract**
 This study investigates the thermodynamics of topological black hole solutions in $R^{2}$ gravity, incorporating the effects of small statistical fluctuations up to first-order corrections. We precisely calculate entropy, internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, specific heat, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy, accounting for perturbative thermal corrections. Our results reveal that the internal energy of small black holes diverges asymptotically due to these fluctuations. The corrected Gibbs free energy attains asymptotically high values for small horizon radii. In contrast, the equilibrium Gibbs free energy approaches zero. Additionally, we assess the stability of the black hole in the presence of these thermal fluctuations. We find that, in contrast to the equilibrium state, the thermal fluctuation introduces a double phase transition to the stability of the black hole. Our analysis reveals that the influence of fluctuations is notably significant, primarily for small black holes. These findings offer new insights into the thermodynamic properties of topological black holes in the presence of thermal fluctuations.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the characteristics of circular geodesics around loop quantum Reissner-Nordström black hole (LQRNBH) and the radiation properties and observational appearance of a thin accretion disk around it. By calculating the shadow radius and utilizing observational data from M87* and Sgr A*, we derive constraints on the quantum parameter $\zeta$ and charge parameter $Q$. The timelike circular geodesics around LQRNBH and the influence of the model parameters on the circular motion are also discussed. It is found that contrary to the case of the parameter $Q$, the increase of the quantum parameter $\zeta$ leads to the increase of the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). Then, by considering a thin accretion disk model, various radiation properties of the LQRNBH and the effects of the model parameters on them are studied. Concrete examples are provided for quantitative comparison of the radiation properties between LQRNBH and Schwarzschild black hole. With the ray-tracing method, the isoradial curves, redshift distributions, and the observed radiation fluxes of the direct and secondary images of the LQRNBH with the thin accretion disk for various model parameters and observation angles are numerically calculated and discussed. These results are beneficial for us to understand the physical consequences of loop quantum gravity effect.

#### Tunnelling in Quantum Cosmology: WKB vs SWKB

 - **Abstract**
 The WKB approximation is a standard tool for studying tunnelling problems in quantum cosmology. We compare this method to the Supersymmetric WKB (SWKB) applied to a closed FRW minisuperspace model. We consider the transition from a dust towards a dark energy-dominated epoch can be explained by a generalized Chaplygin gas. Using analytic approximations for the superpotential (power-series and a Picard approximation), we derive closed-form SWKB tunnelling expressions and compute transmission probabilities as functions of the Chaplygin parameters $A$, $B$ and $\alpha$. Numerical root-finding locates classical turning points and numerical integration allows comparison with standard WKB results. We find that SWKB and WKB agree when the WKB validity condition holds, while the SWKB yields systematically larger (and plausibly more accurate) tunnelling probabilities for parameter values where the WKB assumptions break down. The results support the SWKB as a useful complementary approach for barrier-transmission studies in quantum cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of quadratic quasi-normal modes would provide a direct probe into black hole nonlinear perturbations. We report the first observational evidence of a set of quadratic quasi-normal modes in the gravitational-wave ringdown of a binary black hole merger. Analyzing the signal from GW250114, we detect six nonlinear modes from the quadratic coupling of the fundamental $(2,2,0)$ mode and its first two overtones. At 5 final mass ($M_\mathrm{f}$) after the merger, the evidence for these nonlinear modes reaches a Bayes factor of 74. To single out these contributions, we employ recent theoretical progress to compute the waveforms and subtract the corresponding nonlinear modes from a numerical relativity surrogate waveform. Our data analysis uses a novel method that incorporates inspiral-merger inference results as a highly constraining prior for the ringdown inference. We further perform a test allowing for phenomenological deviations for the theoretically predicted amplitudes of the quadratic modes. The results show that an amplitude of zero is excluded at $3.0~\sigma$ significance level, while the theoretical expectation is consistent with the inference. This detection marks a first step towards observationally characterizing nonlinear perturbations in the ringdown of a black hole.

#### Parameterized Post-Newtonian Analysis of Quadratic Gravity and Solar System Constraints

 - **Abstract**
 This work systematically investigates the post-Newtonian behavior of general quadratic gravity in the weak-field regime. By extending the Einstein-Hilbert action to include quadratic curvature terms as $\mathcal{L}\propto R-\lambda C^2+\mu R^2$, the theory introduces two massive modes: a scalar mode and a ghost tensor mode. Using the post-Newtonian expansion method, we derive the explicit expressions for the metric for a general source up to 1.5PN order. Furthermore, for a point-mass source, we extend the solution to 2PN order and evaluate the effective Parameterized Post-Newtonian parameters $\gamma(r)$ and $\beta(r)$. The results show that deviations from General Relativity are exponentially suppressed. The theory has the feature $\gamma(r)\equiv 1$ when $m_R=m_W$, and to ensure that gravity remains attractive, we have $m_W>m_R/4$. The leading correction to $\beta(r)$ exhibiting a characteristic $\mathcal{O}(r \ln (r)e^{-mr})$ dependence. Based on the Solar System experiments, we derive preliminary constraints on the theory's parameters: $m_R,m_W\gtrsim23~\mathrm{AU}^{-1}$, corresponding to $\lambda\lesssim2.1\times10^{19}~\mathrm{m}^2$ and $\mu\lesssim 7.1\times 10^{18}~\mathrm{m}^2$. This study provides a theoretical foundation for future tests of quadratic gravity using pulsar timing arrays, gravitational-wave observations, and laboratory-scale short-range gravity experiments.

 - **Abstract**
 The trapping (or apparent) horizon serves as a key tool for tracing the complete evolution of black holes. We investigate a class of coordinate singularities induced by such trapping (or apparent) horizons in a spherically symmetric, dynamic spacetime, which are distinct from the well-known coordinate singularities associated with the Killing horizon. In particular, we clarify the geometric structure of this coordinate singularity by means of the Kodama vector field, thereby avoiding unphysical artifacts. We further employ the evolving Ellis drainhole as an analytical model to illustrate key details of this phenomenon.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents an effective microscopic, time-dependent Hamiltonian framework for investigating information dynamics during black hole evaporation. While current approaches often rely on gravitational path integrals or statistical ensembles to recover the Page curve, our model provides an explicit, unitary quantum-mechanical evolution of the radiation. We utilize the Independent Unitary Pairing assumption, where the total Hilbert space is decomposed into N_{total} mutually independent bipartite subsystems. Each subsystem consists of a single interior qubit interacting unitarily with a single radiation qubit, ensuring strict global microscopic unitarity (Von Neumann entropy =0) throughout the process. To reconcile this with macroscopic thermodynamics, we introduce a methodology called "Fermion-like Occupancy Bound", which can be considered as a Holographic Binary Capacity Constraint, where each radiation channel is modeled as a two-level system representing the fundamental unit of information. This truncation, justified by the holographic principle at the Planck scale, enforces a maximum entropy bound of ln2 per channel, which naturally yields the entropy turnaround and final state purification. The central result of this framework is the derivation of a Quantum Condition for Unitarity , which couples microscopic phase evolution with macroscopic observables.

 - **Abstract**
 Island models offer a compelling resolution of the black hole information paradox, but they also raise persistent questions about causal consistency in effective descriptions. In particular, effective theories arising in double holography can exhibit apparent violations of micro-causality, despite the underlying bulk dynamics being local and causal. The aim of this work is to clarify the physical origin of this phenomenon and to identify the structural features that control causal consistency in island models. We argue that the apparent non-causality in double holography is neither intrinsic to island physics nor a consequence of nonlocal operator reconstruction. Rather, it reflects a mismatch between effective spacetime separation and bulk causal accessibility, a feature already implicit in earlier analyses. Nonlocal reconstruction instead encodes quantum error correction within a restricted code subspace and does not introduce independent propagation channels. Motivated by this perspective, we formulate a structural criterion for micro-causality in effective island descriptions. The criterion consists of three conditions: the absence of independent propagation channels beyond those of the bulk theory, a local bulk-supported operator dictionary, and a consistent matching between effective spacelike separation and dynamically accessible bulk causal curves. When these conditions are satisfied, effective micro-causality follows directly from bulk micro-causality. We apply the criterion to brane world realizations of island models, including the defect-extremal-surface construction, and show that they preserve causal consistency, in contrast to double holography. We further demonstrate that the criterion remains robust in time-dependent processes such as island formation and evaporation.
