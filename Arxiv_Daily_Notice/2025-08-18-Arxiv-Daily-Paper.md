 - **Abstract**
 We report the performance of a newly implemented fourth-order accurate finite-volume HLLC Riemann solver in the adaptive-mesh-refinement numerical relativity code {\tt SACRA-MPI}. First, we validate our implementation in one-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamics tests, i.e., a simple wave and shock tube test, which have analytic solutions. We demonstrate that the fourth-order convergence is achieved for the smooth flow, which cannot be achieved in our original second-order accurate finite-volume Riemann solver. We also show that our new solver is robust for the strong shock wave emergence problem. Second, we validate the implementation in a dynamical spacetime by demonstrating that {\tt SACRA-MPI} perfectly preserves the $\pi$-symmetry without imposing the $\pi$-symmetry in a short-term ($\sim 20~{\rm ms}$ in the inspiral and subsequent post-merger phase) non-spinning equal-mass binary neutron star merger simulations. Finally, we quantify the accuracy of $\approx 28$ cycles inspiral gravitational waveforms from binary neutron star mergers by conducting a resolution study with $\approx 78, 94$, $118$, and $135$ m. We find that the fourth-order accurate Riemann solver achieves the convergence order $\approx 2.1\pm{0.05}$--$2.4\pm{0.27}$, i.e., slightly evolving with time, in the inspiral gravitational wave phase, while the second-order accurate Riemann solver achieves the convergence order $\approx 2.0\pm{0.5}$. The residual phase error towards the continuum limit at the merger is $0.27\pm 0.07$ rad and $0.58\pm 0.22$ rad out of a total phase of $\approx 176$ rad, respectively, for the fourth- and second-order accurate Riemann solver.

 - **Abstract**
 Using cosmological radiation-hydrodynamical simulations, we study the effect of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on nearby dark-matter (DM) haloes in the very early universe. We find that an SMBH with a spectral energy distribution (SED) extending from the near-ultraviolet to hard X-rays, can produce a radiation background sufficient to delay gravitational collapse in surrounding DM haloes until up to $10^7$ M$_\odot$ of zero-metallicity gas is available for the formation of Population III (Pop III) stars or direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs). We model three scenarios, corresponding to an SMBH located at physical distances of 10, 100, and 1000 kpc from the Pop III host DM halo. Using these three scenarios, we use the SED to compute self-consistent photoionization, photoheating, and photodissociation rates. We include the effects of Compton scattering and gas self-shielding. The X-ray portion of the spectrum maintains an elevated free-electron fraction as the gas collapses to high density. This stimulates H2 formation, allowing the gas to cool further while counteracting the dissociation of H2 by Lyman-Werner radiation. As a result, a large cluster of Pop III stars is expected to form, except in the case with the most intense radiation in which a DCBH may instead form. Our simulated Pop III clusters have comparable HeII 1640 luminosities to the recently discovered Pop III host candidate near GN-z11, observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. In two of the scenarios we consider, the resulting clusters could be detectable using the telescope's NIRSpec instrument out to z ~ 15.

 - **Abstract**
 It is likely that the disk of a tidal disruption event (TDE) is misaligned with respect to the equatorial plane of the spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH), since the initial stellar orbit before disruption is most likely has an inclined orbital plane. Such misaligned disk undergoes Lense-Thirring precession around the SMBH spin axis, leading to a precessing jet if launched in the vicinity of the SMBH and aligned with the disk angular momentum. The bound debris can also build a thick envelope which powers optical emission. In this work, we study the propagation of the precessing jet in the TDE envelope. We adopt a ``zero-Bernoulli accretion'' (ZEBRA) envelope model. A episodic jet will be observed if the line of sight is just at the envelope pole direction and $\theta_{\rm LT}=\theta_{\rm env}$, since the jet can freely escape from this low density rotation funnel, where $\theta_{\rm LT}$ and $\theta_{\rm env}$ are the jet precessing angle and the angle between the envelope polar axis and the SMBH spin axis, respectively. The jet will be choked at other directions. For $\theta_{\rm LT} < \theta_{\rm env}$, the jets can also break out of the envelope for very small precession angle $\theta_{\rm LT}$ or if the jet is aligned with SMBH spin. If the jet is choked within the envelope, the radiation produced during cocoon shock breakout will imprint characteris

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10930

 - **Abstract**
 The literature suggests that dark energy is responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe due to its negative pressure, therefore, dark energy can be used as a possible option to prevent the gravitational collapse of compact objects into singularities. In this regard, there is a great possibility that dark energy can interact with the compact stellar matter configuration [Phys. Rev. D 103, 084042 (2021)]. In this article, we introduce a physically viable model for celestial compact stars made of isotropic baryonic matter and isotropic dark energy with Heintzmann's ansatz [Zeitschrift für Physik 228, 489-493 (1969)] in the context of Einstein's gravity. Here, the density of dark energy is assumed to be proportional to the density of baryonic matter. The main focus of the present article is to see the effects of dark energy on the physical properties of the stars. We perform an in-depth analysis of the physical attributes of the model, such as metric function, density, pressure, mass-radius relation, compactness parameter, gravitational and surface redshifts, along with the energy conditions for three well-known compact stars. We analyse the equilibrium of the present model via the generalised Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and the stability with the help of the adiabatic index and Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov's static stability condition. Moreover, we estimate the solutions representing the maximum masses and the predicted surface radii from the M-R graph for different values of the coupling parameter {\alpha}. All the analyses ensure that the present model is non-singular and physically viable by satisfying all the essential conditions.

#### The fundamental physical importance of generic off-diagonal solutions and Grigori Perelman entropy in the Einstein gravity theory

 - **Abstract**
 The gravitational field equations in general relativity (GR) consist of a sophisticated system of nonlinear partial differential equations. Solving such equations in some generic off-diagonal forms is usually a hard analytic or numeric task. Physically important solutions in GR were constructed using a diagonal ansatz for metrics with a maximum of 4 independent coefficients. The Einstein equations can be solved in exact or parametric forms determined by some integration constants for corresponding assumptions on spherical or cylindrical spacetime symmetries. The anholonomic frame and connection deformation method allows us to construct generic off-diagonal solutions described by 6 independent coefficients of metrics depending, in general, on all spacetime coordinates. New types of exact and parametric solutions are determined by generating and integration functions and (effective) generating sources. They may describe vacuum gravitational and matter fields solitonic hierarchies; locally anisotropic polarizations of physical constants for black holes, wormholes, black toruses, or cosmological solutions; various types of off-diagonal deformations of horizons, etc. The additional degrees of freedom (related to off-diagonal coefficients) can be used to describe dark energy and dark matter configurations and elaborate locally anisotropic cosmological scenarios. In general, the generic off-diagonal solutions do not involve certain hypersurface or holographic configurations and can't be described in the framework of the Bekenstein-Hawking thermodynamic paradigm. We argue that generalizing the concept of G. Perelman's entropy for relativistic Ricci flows allows us to define and compute geometric thermodynamic variables for all possible classes of solutions in GR.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we examine the thermodynamic geometry of four-dimensional quasi-topological black holes by computing the Ruppeiner scalar curvature R which serves as an empirical tool to describe the nature of interactions among black hole microstructures. In four dimensions, we write novel black hole solutions within the framework of generalized quasi-topological gravity, extended through a fundamental p-form field. Temperature, entropy, and thermodynamic volume are explicitly expressed using the extended first law. The nature of the interactions between the microstructure is then revealed by computing R, where positive curvature indicates repulsion dominant interactions and negative curvature indicates the dominance of attraction. Our approach uses divergences and sign changing nature of R to identify critical points and phase transitions. Further, our analysis reveals a notably streamlined thermodynamic behavior, a single zero-crossing of curvature R, marking a second-order phase transition and offering direct insight into the underlying microstructure interactions.

#### Echoes and quasinormal modes of asymmetric black bounces

 - **Abstract**
 We study quasinormal modes and echoes of symmetric and asymmetric black bounce solutions generated by anisotropic fluids within the framework of general relativity. We derive the effective potential governing massless scalar fields and compute the corresponding quasinormal mode spectra using three independent methods: sixth-order WKB, Pöschl-Teller and time-domain evolution. Our results show that symmetric black bounce configurations with horizons yield a standard single-barrier potential, while horizonless solutions may exhibit multiple potential barriers that generate gravitational wave echoes. These echoes are sensitive to model parameters such as the fluid energy density and the regularizing parameter $a$ that defines the minimal $2$-sphere. The asymmetric models considered recover the Reissner-Nordström solution in their external region but can be bounded or unbounded in the inside, depending on the sign of a parameter. Both cases have similar qualitative properties as far as wave emission is concerned but show no echoes. This makes it very difficult to distinguish them from standard Reissner-Nordström configurations.

#### Quest for particles production in the plane gravitational wave spacetime

 - **Abstract**
 Massless vector and scalar Green's functions are obtained in closed form for a plane gravitational wave spacetime using three independent methods: direct solution of the Green-function equation and construction via the DeWitt and Hadamard recursive schemes. The results coincide exactly with the DeWitt--Schwinger expansion, indicating no massless particles production in this background. Contrasting interpretations, based on Bogolyubov coefficient calculations predicting massless particle creation, are also addressed.

#### Holography at Finite N: Breakdown of Bulk Reconstruction for Subregions

 - **Abstract**
 Within AdS/CFT, focusing on the AdS-Rindler wedge, we show that when $N$ is large but finite, correlation functions of reconstructed bulk operators grow exponentially with bulk momentum, overwhelming the usual $1/N$ suppression. The growth starts when the smeared operator's ultraviolet scale goes beyond a critical value $\Lambda_{crit} = \frac{2}{\pi}\ln N$, which is far below the Planck scale. Above this logarithmic threshold, the large $N$ expansion ceases to be reliable, and the would-be bulk operators cannot be consistently defined as observables in the full quantum gravity theory. Since the AdS-Rindler wedge describes the near-horizon region of black holes, this result implies a sharp $\ln N$ cutoff for reconstructing bulk operators across horizons. This has a direct impact on whether and how information from the black hole interior is encoded-a central question in the black hole information paradox.
