#### Downsizing does not extend to dwarf galaxies: identifying the stellar mass regimes shaped by supernova and AGN feedback

 - **Abstract**
 We explore how the fraction of red (quenched) galaxies varies in the dwarf galaxy regime (10^7 MSun < Mstar < 10^9.5 MSun), using a mass-complete sample of ~5900 dwarfs at z<0.15, constructed using deep multi-wavelength data in the COSMOS field. The red fraction decreases steadily until Mstar ~ 10^8.5 MSun and then increases again towards lower stellar masses. This 'U' shape demonstrates that the traditional notion of 'downsizing' (i.e. that progressively lower mass galaxies maintain star formation until later epochs) is incorrect -- downsizing does not continue uninterrupted into the dwarf regime. The U shape persists regardless of environment, indicating that it is driven by internal processes rather than external environment-driven mechanisms. Our results suggest that, at Mstar < 10^8 MSun, the quenching of star formation is dominated by supernova (SN) feedback and becomes more effective with decreasing stellar mass, as the potential well becomes shallower. At Mstar > 10^9 MSun, the quenching is driven by a mix of SN feedback and AGN feedback (which becomes more effective with increasing stellar mass, as central black holes become more massive). The processes that quench star formation are least effective in the range 10^8 MSun < Mstar < 10^9 MSun, likely because the potential well is deep enough to weaken the impact of SN feedback, while the effect of AGN feedback is still insignificant. The cosmological simulations tested here do not match the details of how the red fraction varies as a function of stellar mass -- we propose that the red fraction vs stellar mass relation (particularly in the dwarf regime) is a powerful calibrator for the processes that regulate star formation in galaxy formation models.

 - **Abstract**
 Polarimetric interferometry is a powerful tool for probing both black hole accretion physics and the background spacetime. Current models aimed at explaining the observed multiwavelength flares in Sgr A* often assume hotspots moving on geodesic, Keplerian orbits. In many scenarios, though, a hotspot may instead follow an inspiraling trajectory, potentially transitioning into a plunge toward the black hole. In this work, we present a general framework to simulate the polarized emission from generic equatorial inspiraling hotspots in Kerr spacetime using a parametric four-velocity profile. This parametrization defines a continuous family of flows, ranging from Cunningham's disk model (fixed radius orbits outside the innermost stable circular orbit and plunging motion within the innermost stable circular orbit) to purely radial motion, thereby extending the standard assumptions. Within this framework, we show that inspiral motion produces a distinctive observational signature: a precessing, unwinding evolution of the polarimetric Stokes Q-U looping pattern, in sharp contrast with the closed Q-U loops associated with stable orbits at a fixed radius. We then explore how the morphology of these signatures depends on black hole spin, observer inclination, and magnetic-field configuration. The presented model can be applied to current and near-future interferometric observations of linear polarization, offering a new avenue to probe the physics of matter spiraling inward and the relativistic velocities of plunging plasma.

#### Black Hole Feedback, Galaxy Quenching and Outflows at Cosmic Dawn: Analysis of the SEEDZ Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Here we analyse the growth and feedback effects of massive black holes (MBHs) in the SEEDZ simulations. The most massive black holes grow to masses of $\sim10^{6}$ M$_\odot$ by $z=12.5$ during short bursts of super-Eddington accretion, sustained over a period of 5-30 Myr. We find that the determining factor that cuts off this initial growth is feedback from the MBH itself, rather than nearby supernovae or exhausting the available gas reservoir. Our simulations show that for the most actively accreting MBHs, feedback completely evacuates the gas from the host halo and ejects it into the inter-galactic medium. Despite implementing a relatively weak feedback model, the energy injected into the gas surrounding the MBH exceeds the binding energy of the halo. These results either indicate that MBH feedback in the early ($\Lambda$CDM) Universe is much weaker than previously assumed, or that at least some of the high redshift galaxies we currently observe with JWST formed via a two-step process, whereby a MBH initially quenches its host galaxy and later reconstitutes its baryonic reservoir, either through mergers with gas rich galaxies or from accretion from the cosmic web. Moreover, the maximum black hole masses that emerge in SEEDZ are effectively set by a combination of MBH feedback modelling and the binding potential of the host halo. Unless feedback is extremely ineffective at early times (for example if growth is merger dominated rather than accretion dominated or feedback is contained close to the MBH) then the maximum mass of black holes at redshift before 12.5 should not significantly exceed $10^6$ M$_\odot$.

#### Unraveling the mysteries of Jets in peculiar NLSy1 galaxies through multi-wavelength variability

 - **Abstract**
 Radio-quiet narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (RQ-NLSy1s) are generally considered to be dominated by thermal emission from the accretion disk. However, recurring 37 GHz radio flares detected from seven RQ-NLSy1s by the Metsahovi Radio Observatory suggest that non-thermal processes may also contribute to their emission. We present a systematic optical and mid-infrared (MIR) variability study combined with broadband SED modeling to investigate the origin of their flux variations and assess the relative contributions of accretion disk and possible jet-related components. High-cadence optical light curves in the g, r, and i bands were obtained from ZTF, while long-term MIR light curves in the W1 and W2 bands were taken from WISE. Optical variability was quantified using the FAGN-test, peak-to-peak variability amplitude, and fractional variability, while MIR variability was characterized using redshift-corrected intrinsic variability amplitudes. Optical variability was examined from intra-night to long-term timescales, and MIR variability on long-term timescales. All RQ-NLSy1s show statistically significant long-term optical variability, with amplitudes increasing toward shorter wavelengths. Three sources exhibit bluer-when-brighter trends and increasing variability amplitudes across the optical bands, indicating a non-thermal contribution. Intrinsic MIR variability is detected in three of the four sources. Significant optical-MIR and MIR intra-band lags are observed, while optical intra-band lags are insignificant. Optical variability amplitudes are anti-correlated with the Eddington ratio and positively correlated with black hole mass. These results suggest that a subset of RQ-NLSy1s hosts weak or intermittent jets contributing to their optical and MIR emission, supported by SED modeling. Coordinated multi-wavelength monitoring is required to better constrain the origin of these variations.

#### Probing Dust Composition in Distant Galaxies with JWST Mid-IR Spectroscopy of Quasars with Foreground 2175 A Absorbers I: Methodology

 - **Abstract**
 Interstellar dust plays a crucial role in gas cooling and molecule formation, influencing galaxy evolution. However, the composition and structure of dust in distant galaxies are still poorly understood. We have started a JWST MIRI MRS program investigating the dust features in gas-rich and dusty galaxies at redshifts $z<$1.2, with strong 2175~Å bumps detected in absorption along the lines of sight to distant background quasars. Here we describe our program strategy, and present MIRI MRS observations of IR dust features at $z=0.5-1.2$ in five quasar spectra that form the first part of our full sample. We identify artifacts in MIRI MRS data that affect the background in IFU cubes, and propose methods to reduce their effects. We pay special attention to modeling the quasar mid-IR continuum, which shows significant variation depending on AGN morphology, redshift, and black hole mass. Dust in foreground galaxies produces significant absorption from the 10~$\mu$m silicate feature in all five quasar spectra. Compared with the average 10~$\mu$m silicate feature in the diffuse ISM of the Milky Way, we find differences in the absorption peak position, width of the features, and asymmetry of the profiles. A detailed study of these silicate features is presented in our next paper (Klimenko et al. 2026b). In two quasar spectra, we tentatively detect weak IR features near 3.0 and 3.4~$\mu$m. Their strengths are comparable to those seen in the Milky Way ISM, but follow-up observations are required to confirm these detections.

#### A Gravitational Wave Background from Intermediate Mass Black Holes in AGN Disks

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) formed in active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks are expected to inspiral into their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), generating a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background in the mHz--decihertz band. Using the population-agnostic energetic formalism, we treat the AGN-disk channel as a mass-flow pipeline connecting the stellar-mass black hole population observed by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) to the SMBH mass reservoir via IMBHs. By anchoring this estimate to the LVK merger rate densities and the cosmic SMBH mass density derived from scaling relations, we derive a limit on the background amplitude. We show that the total energy density of the background is bounded by the global mass budget of SMBH growth. For fiducial parameters consistent with the fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4), this yields a characteristic strain $A_{\rm IMR} \simeq (1.2_{-0.2}^{+0.2})\times 10^{-21}$ at $3\,{\rm mHz}$. While this fiducial amplitude is subdominant to the Galactic white dwarf foreground and the stellar-mass Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) background, we show it can be distinguished by its non-Gaussian statistics and higher frequency cutoff. This new background may be detectable in the decihertz band where proposed detectors such as the Big Bang Observer or long-baseline lunar interferometers can measure it cleanly. A detection would provide a direct, model-independent constraint on the efficiency with which AGN disks process stellar remnants into SMBH mass growth, linking the LVK and LISA bands.

 - **Abstract**
 We report the discovery of the first transient relativistic iron K{\alpha} line in an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) J1047+5907. The line was detected 21.5 days (rest-frame) after an X-ray coronal flare observed in 2008 and it exhibits significant broadening consistent with relativistic reflection from the accretion disk in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). The line has a width of ~300 eV, corresponding to a Keplerian velocity of 14,000 km s-1, at a distance of 5-41 light-days from the SMBH, strongly implying that the observed coronal flare triggered the emergence of the line. This event provides rare direct evidence of the response of the accretion disk to impulsive coronal illumination and offers a new method to probe the SMBH and disk physics. The relativistic modeling favors a broadened line produced by distant reflection from an accretion disk around a rapidly spinning black hole viewed at an intermediate inclination, consistent with other observations. Systematic monitoring of type 1 AGN following strong X-ray flares may open a new observational window into the innermost regions of AGN, enabling constraints on the physics of SMBH and its accretion disk at different radii that are otherwise challenging to access.

#### Are carbon deflagration supernovae triggered by dark matter ?

 - **Abstract**
 Collisions between stellar remnants and dark matter in the Galactic bulge are frequent, and the kinetic energy of a primordial black hole incident on a white dwarf, if it is all thermalized, will raise the degenerate core's temperature, by at least a degree in the case of a lunar mass black hole. This is an underestimate in two ways: the specific heat is less than 3k/2 per particle, and the incoming object is accelerated by gravitational focusing. Detailed physical models have recently been made of this triggering event. Present observational data are equivocal as to whether the radial distribution of type Ia supernovae in galaxies follows the starlight in the galaxies, or is more concentrated towards the center, as collisional triggering would suggest. But future samples of millions of supernovae from the Rubin telescope will change that.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations found 12 candidates for microlensing events. These events can be explained by primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses of $10^{-7}$-$10^{-6} M_\odot$ and a fraction of all dark matter of $f_\mathrm{PBH} = \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. In this paper, we consider the PBH production in two types of the axionlike curvaton models, which predict an enhancement of the curvature perturbations on small scales. We show that the microlensing events can be explained in the axionlike curvaton model and discuss the cosmological implications such as gravitational waves.

#### X-ray Timing and Spectral studies of bare AGN Mrk 110

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the soft X-ray excess below 2 keV in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) remains debated, with relativistic reflection from the inner accretion disk and warm Comptonization in an optically thick corona being the leading explanations. We investigate the timing and spectral properties of the Seyfert galaxy Mrk 110 using six XMM-Newton observations. A frequency-dependent lag analysis in the 7-9 $\times 10^{-5}$ Hz range reveals a soft X-ray lag of 889-3000s in the combined 2019 data, detected with a significance of 80%. The cross-correlation function analysis, supported by simulations, also detects lags of similar nature. Spectral modeling performed by adopting both proposed black hole masses in the literature for Mrk 110 confirms the presence of a warm corona in all observations, along with a weak relativistic reflection component and the reflection fraction remains low (Rf < 1). Interpreting the measured soft lag in terms of light travel time implies an emission radius 4.5 Rg for a supermassive black hole mass of $M = 1.4 \times 10^8$ solar mass , favoring a reflection scenario. However, if a lower mass of $M = 2 \times 10^7$ solar mass is adopted, the inferred radius increases, and both relativistic reflection and warm Comptonization can plausibly contribute to the observed soft lag. The warm corona radius appears larger in the high accretion state and smaller in a lower accretion state, although no trend can be established. The persistently low reflection fraction suggests an outflowing inner corona in Mrk 110, consistent with the recent detection of jet activity in this source.

#### Stellar-mass black holes in young massive and open stellar clusters -- VII. Comparisons with gravitational-wave events until LVK-O4a and Gaia compact binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave (GW) detections by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observatories suggest multiple formation channels for GW compact binary mergers. Here I assess the role of young massive clusters (YMC) evolving into old open clusters (OC) -- the YMC/OC channel -- to the GW merger population. A homogeneous grid of 90 N-body evolutionary model star clusters, spanning initial masses of $10^4M_\odot\leq M_{cl}(0)\leq10^5M_\odot$, half-mass radii of 1-3 pc, and metallicities between 0.0002-0.02 is computed with the direct, post-Newtonian N-body code NBODY7. The N-body simulations include primordial binaries, delayed stellar-remnant model forming black holes (BH) and neutron stars (NS), BH spin prescriptions, and GW recoil kicks, and they are evolved until BH depletion. Most GW mergers from the cluster models are dynamically assembled binary black holes (BBH) that merge within their host clusters. Merger mass ratios reach down to 0.1-0.2 despite an overall bias toward nearly symmetric pairs. The GW merger efficiency varies non-monotonically with cluster mass, peaking around $M_{cl}(0)=7.5\times10^4M_\odot$ and also for $M_{cl}(0)\leq3.0\times10^4M_\odot$. The computed mergers reproduce some of the key features of the latest observed GW event catalogue, including asymmetric low-mass mergers, misaligned events among highly spinning, massive BHs, and an excess of $30M_\odot$ primaries, though they under-produce $10M_\odot$ primaries, hinting at contributions from other channels. The model merger rate density accounts for 25%-33% of the observed rate; it increases with redshift somewhat faster than the cosmic star formation, consistently with LVK's inferences. The model effective spin distribution is positively asymmetric at zero redshift and broadens with redshift. The models yield field BH- and NS-main sequence star binaries with parameters consistent with the Gaia-discovered candidates. [Abgd.]

#### Constraining long-lived dark sector particles with CMB and Lyman-$α$

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10078

 - **Abstract**
 We use measurements of the intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest to place new limits on models in which long-lived dark sector (DS) particles, with lifetimes longer than $10^{16}$ s, deposit energy into the IGM through their decays. Such DS decays into Standard Model (SM) states can modify the late-time thermal history of the IGM, making Lyman-$\alpha$ data a sensitive probe of hidden sectors with cosmologically long lifetimes. Our analysis demonstrates that constraints from late-time IGM heating offer a complementary window to those from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), in constraining dark sector parameter space. We further revisit limits on such decaying DS models from Planck's measurements of the optical depth to reionization and provide updates relevant for DS lifetimes longer than $10^{14}$ s. The model-independent constraints on the DS parameter space we derive in this work can be reinterpreted for a wide range of decaying hidden-sector scenarios, including evaporating primordial black holes and SM-coupled dark photons.

 - **Abstract**
 The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with astoundingly high signal-to-noise ratio, leaving parameter estimation with these signals susceptible to seemingly small waveform errors. Of particular concern for MBHBs are errors due to neglected higher-order modes. We extend Yi et al. [arXiv:2502.12237] to examine errors due to neglected higher-order modes for MBHBs with nonzero (aligned) progenitor spins and total mass up to $10^8\,M_\odot$. For these very massive systems, there can be regions of parameter space in which the $(\ell, |m|)=(2,\,2)$ modes are no longer dominant with respect to higher-order ones. We find that the extent of systematic bias can change significantly when varying the progenitor spins of the binary. We also find that for the heaviest, and therefore shortest, MBHB signals, slight systematic errors can cause severe mis-inference of the sky localization parameters. We propose an improved likelihood optimization scheme with respect to previous work as a way to predict these effects in a computationally efficient manner.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, the optical effects that occur near a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) with a Dehnen-type $(1,4,2)$ dark matter (DM) halo are explored. We first derive the photon sphere radius and obtain an analytical expression for the deflection angle in the weak-field regime by applying the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT). For the strong-field regime, we perform ray-tracing calculations to examine the behavior of light trajectories and determine the corresponding number of orbits. We further compute the BH shadow and gravitational lensing in a plasma medium and provide constraints arising from the DM halo parameters. We also extend our analysis to weak gravitational lensing within plasma environments, considering both uniform and singular isothermal sphere (SIS) distributions. We find the analytical expressions for the deflection angle in the presence of plasma and examine the resulting effects on image magnification. The overall results highlight how DM halo properties and plasma characteristics jointly alter observable lensing signatures.

#### Temperature of a spinning black hole via a simple derivation

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.09244

 - **Abstract**
 According to current theory a black hole has a nonzero temperature and thus radiates like any black body. This remarkable result was first shown by Hawking for a non-spinning black hole using general relativity to describe the black hole gravitational field and quantum field theory to describe the radiation. Since then the temperature of a spinning Kerr black hole has been calculated. There have also been many heuristic derivations for the temperature. In this work we derive the temperature of a Kerr spinning black hole using only classical general relativity and thermodynamics. It is very similar to Ref. 11 but is mathematically simpler and more self-contained. Our purpose is mainly pedagogical, to be more accessible to students and non-specialists with a knowledge of general relativity. We also call further attention to the expected explosive evaporation of small black holes, not yet observed, which would be an almost unique window into Planck scale physics. Finally, we discuss the idea that the cosmological dark matter, whose nature is currently unknown, may be composed of small primordial black hole remnants.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate periodic bound orbits and gravitational wave (GW) emission in the Schwarzschild-Bertotti-Robinson (Schwarzschild-BR) spacetime-an exact electrovacuum solution describing a static black hole (BH) immersed in a uniform magnetic field. We explore how the background magnetic field qualitatively alters the BH's gravitational dynamics, affecting timelike geodesics such as the marginally bound orbit (MBO) and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). We then analyze periodic bound orbits using the frequency ratio ${\omega_{\varphi}}/{\omega_{r}}$, which characterizes the orbits by their azimuthal and radial motions. Based on the numerical kludge method we further compute the gravitational waveforms emitted from periodic orbits around a supermassive Schwarzschild-BR BH. We show that the background magnetic field significantly changes orbital frequencies, resonance conditions, zoom-whirl structures, and the resulting waveforms. Finally, we examine the frequency spectra in the mHz range and the detectability of these GW signals by computing the characteristic strain via a discrete Fourier transform on the time-domain waveforms, comparing the results with the sensitivity curves of space-based GW detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. Our results show that intrinsically magnetic fields modify spacetime and leave observable imprints on extreme mass-ratio inspiral GWs, which may be tested by future observations.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper systematically revisits the critical orbits of test particles moving in various black hole backgrounds, including the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman spacetimes. We identify the critical orbit cases directly from the root structure of the radial equation, and provide explicit expressions relating the relevant parameters -- energy, angular momentum, and charge-to-mass ratio -- to the critical radius, as well as explicit expressions for the critical orbits in each scenario. Special attention is given to the relationship between the photon spheres, black hole shadows and the critical null geodesics. Extensive numerical results are also provided.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by recent efforts to bridge between weak-field and strong-field descriptions of black-hole binary dynamics, we develop a resummation scheme for post-Minkowskian radiative observables in extreme-mass-ratio scattering, augmented with post-Newtonian terms. Specifically, we derive universal interpolation formulas for the total energy emitted in gravitational waves out to infinity and down the event horizon of the large black hole, valid to leading order in the small mass ratio. We test our formulas using numerical results from direct calculations in black hole perturbation theory. The central idea of our approach is to utilize as a strong-field diagnostic the known form of divergence in the radiated energy along geodesics near the parameter-space separatrix between scattering and plunge. The dominant, logarithmic term of this divergence can be expressed in terms of instantaneous energy fluxes calculated along the unstable circular geodesics that form the separatrix, fluxes that we obtain using interpolation of highly accurate numerical data. The same idea could be applied to bound-orbit radiative observables via either unbound-to-bound mapping or a direct resummation of bound-orbit post-Newtonian expressions.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform the quantization of Teukolsky scalars of spin $0$, $\pm 1$, and $\pm 2$ within the algebraic approach to quantum field theory. We first discuss the classical phase space, from which we subsequently construct the algebra. This sheds light on which fields are conjugates of each other. Further, we construct the Unruh state for this theory on Kerr and show that it is Hadamard on the black hole exterior and the interior up to the inner horizon. This shows not only that Hadamard states exist for this theory, but also extends the existence and Hadamard property of the Unruh state to (bosonic) Teukolsky fields on Kerr, where such a result was previously missing.

 - **Abstract**
 The Lee-Yang phase transition theory applied in the anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole has inspired the exploration of complex phase diagram and supercritical phenomena in black hole thermodynamics. In this study, we extend the approach to the four dimensional Born-Infeld AdS black hole. This system exhibits a rich phase structure, including reentrant phase transitions, due to the modulation of the Born-Infeld nonlinear parameter. Through the analysis by Lee-Yang zeros, we obtained the complex phase diagram of the Born-Infeld AdS black hole and derived the supercritical crossover line -- Widom line. It strictly originates from the first-order stable critical point. The results indicate that Born-Infeld nonlinear effects significantly alter the types and characteristics of phase transition in critical region, while do not disrupt the uniqueness of the Widom line in supercritical region. Our study uncovers a universal simplified feature of the thermodynamic behavior of nonlinear gravitational systems in supercritical region. It also deepens our understanding of the fundamental connection between critical phenomena and continuous phase transitions in the extended phase space of black holes.
