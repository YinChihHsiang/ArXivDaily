#### Isotropic Equivalence of STVG--MOG and $Λ$CDM and Its Breakdown in Large--Scale Anisotropic Cosmological Observables
 - **Authors:** John W. Moffat

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22207

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22207

 - **Abstract**
 We show that Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) is observationally equivalent to the standard model $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model for all probes that depend on isotropic and linear gravitational dynamics, including galaxy rotation curves, cluster lensing, the linear matter power spectrum P(k), $\sigma_8$, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This degeneracy arises from the scale-dependent effective gravitational coupling $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$, which ensures identical background evolution, transfer functions, and linear growth. Consequently, all early-universe, low and intermediate scale cosmological observables are equally well described by STVG-MOG without invoking non-baryonic dark matter. We argue that the equivalence implies that isotropic cosmological data alone cannot establish the physical existence of dark matter. The degeneracy is broken only by observables sensitive to large-scale, anisotropic gravitational response. In particular, recent measurements of enhanced radio-galaxy and quasar number-count dipoles at gigaparsec scales probe a regime where $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$ departs from its $\Lambda$CDM limit, allowing STVG-MOG to generate anisotropic bulk flows, while preserving consistency with all isotropic constraints. These observations provide a concrete pathway for empirically distinguishing modified gravity from particle dark matter.

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope has unveiled an abundant population of potential active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshift ($z\gtrsim4$) known as little red dots (LRDs), which are likely hosted in relatively low-mass galaxies. However, previous theoretical models have highlighted the difficulty in continuously feeding massive black holes in the central regions of bursty, high-redshift galaxies because of repeated gas evacuation by stellar feedback. We analyze galaxies in high-redshift FIRE-2 simulations to understand whether they are capable of hosting the observed abundant population of high-redshift AGN. We use a gravitational torque-driven accretion (GTDA) model and a simple free-fall accretion model to derive black hole accretion rates and construct predicted AGN bolometric luminosity functions for $z=5-7$. The GTDA model and the free-fall model with black holes accreting $\lesssim 1$ percent of their central gas supply ($<100 \rm \ pc$) per free-fall time predict AGN abundances that are more than sufficient to explain the most recent LRD observations. The fiducial models, in fact, overpredict the number of low-luminosity AGN as compared with observations. We explore possible resolutions of this tension. A plausible, though likely not unique, scenario for alleviating the AGN overpredictions and which also provides a good match to the host-galaxy UV luminosity distribution suggests that LRDs are super Eddington-accreting, Eddington luminosity-limited, $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim 2\times10^5 \ \rm M_\odot$ black holes residing in $M_\star \gtrsim 2\times10^7 \ \rm M_\odot$ galaxies.

#### Subsolar mass black holes from stellar collapse induced by primordial black holes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22220

 - **Abstract**
 While no gravitational-wave detection of subsolar mass black holes has been confirmed to date, a number of candidate detections invite us to speculate on the origin of such black holes should a detection be confirmed. It is generally assumed that the observation of a black hole with subsolar mass $M_{\rm obs}$ would provide strong evidence for primordial black holes (PBHs). The mass $M_{\rm PBH}$ of the PBH, however, does not necessarily have to be equal to $M_{\rm obs}$, as it would in what we term a ``direct PBH scenario". Instead, a black hole of mass $M_{\rm obs}$ may form in a capture of a much smaller primordial black hole, $M_{\rm PBH} \ll M_{\rm obs}$, by a dwarf star of mass $M_* \simeq M_{\rm obs}$, followed by the total consumption of the star by the PBH. We provide some rough estimates and demonstrate that such an ``indirect PBH scenario" may also lead to significant populations of black holes with mass $M_{\rm obs}$, especially in dwarf galaxies, and may be able to explain rare subsolar mass events.

#### Tensions in Cosmology: Interpreting Them Through Inhomogeneous Models

 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22278

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22278

 - **Abstract**
 We review a subset of the current tensions affecting the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, emphasizing the role of chronic systematics and significance inflation in shaping their interpretation. As a unifying framework, we consider the spherically symmetric inhomogeneous $\Lambda$LTB model and use it as a set of "glasses" through which to reinterpret the Hubble, dipole, and dark-energy tensions. Large-scale spatial gradients in this model introduce anisotropic expansion and position-dependent observables, allowing local estimates of $H_{0}$ to shift, dipolar signatures to arise, and an apparently evolving dark-energy equation of state to be mimicked without invoking genuinely dynamical dark energy. We discuss how these effects are constrained once the full supernova, CMB, and large-scale-structure data sets are included, and argue that it remains unclear whether any single $\Lambda$LTB configuration can simultaneously account for all major anomalies. More broadly, we highlight that cosmology currently lacks a widely accepted baseline model that is both theoretically well founded and capable of accommodating the Hubble and dark-energy tensions, leaving us without a true concordance framework for forecasting future surveys.

#### Testing the Association of Supermassive Black Hole Infrared Flares and High-energy Neutrinos

 - **Abstract**
 The physical origin of the observed cosmic neutrinos remains an open question and the subject of active research. While matter accretion onto supermassive black holes is long thought to accelerate particles to high energies, it has recently been suggested that tidal disruption events, and accretion flares in general, with prominent IR echoes can account for a fraction of the diffuse high-energy neutrino signal. Motivated by this result, we compile a sample of nearby accretion flares detected in the NEOWISE survey featuring strong IR echoes, and we cross-match it with the latest catalog of neutrino alerts, IceCat-1. We recover only a single spatial coincidence between the two catalogs, consistent with a chance coincidence. We find no temporal and spatial coincidences between the two samples, which, given the properties of our sample, appears to challenge previous conclusions. We discuss the physical implications of our results and potential future explorations.

#### How isotropic is dark energy?

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22351

 - **Abstract**
 Tensions in late-time expansion data have renewed interest in models beyond $\Lambda$CDM. We ask: \emph{how isotropic must dark energy be?} Working in Bianchi~I, we allow time-dependent anisotropic stress and introduce a parameterisation that enforces a vanishing line-of-sight integral of the shear, thereby satisfying the CMB ISW quadrupole bound by construction. Using Pantheon+SH0ES SNe together with DESI BAO distances, single-bin (constant) and five-bin anisotropic models improve the fit over $w$CDM by $\Delta(-2\ln L_{\rm iso})=14.8$ and $26.6$ respectively, but both violate the quadrupole constraint. In contrast, a five-bin constrained model achieves $\Delta(-2\ln L_{\rm iso})=15.4$ while remaining compatible with the quadrupole limit. The fit improvement arises from two sources: capturing directional structure in the Pantheon+ SNe data, and partially alleviating the tension between the SH0ES $H_0$ value and DESI BAO distances.

 - **Abstract**
 Extremely large mass-ratio inspirals (XMRIs), consisting of a brown dwarf orbiting a supermassive black hole, emit long-lived and nearly monochromatic gravitational waves in the millihertz band and constitute a promising probe of strong-field gravity and black-hole properties. However, dedicated data-analysis pipelines for XMRI signals have not yet been established. In this work, we develop, for the first time, a hierarchical semi-coherent search pipeline for XMRIs tailored to space-based gravitational-wave detectors, with a particular focus on the TianQin mission. The pipeline combines a semi-coherent multi-harmonic $\mathcal{F}$-statistic with particle swarm optimization, and incorporates a novel eccentricity estimation method based on the relative power distribution among harmonics. We validate the performance of the pipeline using simulated TianQin data for a Galactic center XMRI composed of a brown dwarf and Sgr A*. For a three-month observation, the pipeline successfully recovers the signal and achieves high-precision parameter estimation, including fractional uncertainties of $<10^{-6}$ in the orbital frequency, $\lesssim10^{-3}$ in the eccentricity, $\lesssim2\times10^{-3}$ in the black-hole mass, and $\lesssim10^{-3}$ in the black-hole spin. Our framework establishes a practical foundation for future XMRI searches with space-based detectors and highlights the potential of XMRIs as precision probes of stellar dynamics and strong-field gravity in the vicinity of supermassive black holes.

#### A Formation Crisis of Repeating Partial Tidal Disruption Events

 - **Abstract**
 A number of candidate repeating partial tidal disruption events (rpTDEs) have been reported in recent years. If these events are confirmed, the high fraction of observed rpTDEs among all tidal disruption events (TDEs) is in tension with prediction of the loss cone channel. We further point out an inequality $M_\bullet \lesssim 4\times 10^6 M_\odot (T_{\rm obt}/10\ {\rm yr})^{4/9}$ that must be satisfied for rpTDEs of solar type stars in the loss cone channel, where $M_\bullet$ is the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass and $T_{\rm obt}$ is the orbital period of the star. However the majority of reported rpTDE candidates potentially violate this inequality, indicating an alternative formation channel. In the commonly invoked Hills mechanism, the captured stars produced by tidal disruption of near-contact binaries can evade this inequality and may be the dominant source of rpTDEs. If the same process operates in the Galactic Center, there should exist a population of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) ejected with velocities as high as $3.6\times 10^3 (M_\bullet/10^6 M_\odot)^{1/6}\ {\rm km\ s}^{-1}$, which however have not been detected. A complete search for HVSs in the Milky Way will be critical for testing this prediction.

 - **Abstract**
 The third data release of the Gaia mission (Gaia DR3) has enabled large-scale searches for dormant black hole and neutron star binaries with stellar companions at wide separations. A recent study has proposed thousands of dormant black hole and neutron star binary candidates using summary statistics from Gaia DR3 by simulating and fitting Gaia observables. In this Letter, we perform broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting from the optical to the infrared for 1,328 candidates, incorporating GALEX ultraviolet photometry to assess the presence of hidden hot companions. We quantify ultraviolet excess by comparing observed near-ultraviolet fluxes with single-star SED predictions and further test whether excesses can be explained by non-degenerate stellar companions for sources exhibiting moderate excess. We additionally examine the Galactic kinematics of the sample to identify systems potentially affected by natal kicks during compact-object formation. By combining the ultraviolet and kinematic diagnostics, we identify 176 sources as the highest-priority candidates for follow-up observations, in which 19 are black hole candidates with previously provided masses $\geq$ 3 $M_\odot$.

#### A unified framework for hot accretion flows with finite angular momentum: from Bondi-like to disc-like regimes

 - **Abstract**
 Observations of X-ray luminous elliptical galaxies suggest that the accretion rate onto the central supermassive black hole can reach a substantial fraction of the Bondi rate. However, classical accretion theory applicable to such hot accretion flows treats spherically symmetric Bondi accretion and disc-like advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) as two distinct limiting cases, lacking a unified framework for flows with finite angular momentum. In this work, we develop such a framework that continuously connects these two regimes. Our model naturally recovers the Bondi solution in the limit of vanishing angular momentum and approaches the properties of classical ADAFs at high angular momentum, while providing a physically well-defined description of the intermediate regime where neither limiting case is strictly applicable. We further demonstrate that the accretion rate is jointly regulated by the angular momentum of the ambient gas and the gas viscosity. For sufficiently large but physically reasonable viscosity, the accretion rate can remain at a significant fraction of the Bondi rate even in the presence of substantial gas rotation. These results offer a natural explanation for how such accretion rates can be sustained despite finite angular momentum in realistic galactic environments.

 - **Abstract**
 Powerful outflows along the accretion disk, known as disk winds, are sometimes launched in black hole X-ray binaries. These winds often manifest themselves in X-ray spectra as blueshifted, highly ionized absorption lines. Previous observations suggest that the mass loss rate from the disk due to disk winds can be comparable to or even more than the mass accretion rate onto the black hole, indicating that disk winds likely play crucial roles in shaping the accretion disk structure and affecting the surrounding environment. However, the mechanisms driving these winds, as well as how their structure changes in response to variations in the mass accretion rate, remain poorly understood. The X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), launched in September 2023, is equipped with Resolve, a cutting-edge X-ray micro-calorimeter that delivers unprecedented spectral resolution. Resolve is expected to significantly advance our understanding of wind launching mechanisms and their impact on accretion processes and environments. In this article, we review the progress made in the pre-XRISM era, highlight key results obtained from XRISM observations to date, and outline future prospects.

#### Equatorially Asymmetric Magnetic Fields and Their Impact on Black Hole Accretion Dynamics

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of equatorial asymmetry in the magnetic field geometry on accretion dynamics around a spinning black hole using axisymmetric general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We consider a Fishbone--Moncrief torus orbiting a Kerr black hole with spin parameter $a = 0.9375$, threaded by large-scale magnetic fields that are asymmetric about the equatorial plane. The degree of equatorial asymmetry in the magnetic field is parametrized by an angle, with values of $30^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $60^\circ$. We examine how this equatorially asymmetric initial magnetic field configuration influences the magnetic field structure, accretion flow morphology, and angular momentum transport across a range of initial plasma beta values ($\beta = 0.007, 0.005, 0.001$). We find that such deformation in the magnetic field leads to noticeable changes in the inner disk structure, asymmetric outflow patterns in the poloidal plane, and time-dependent variations in accretion rates. These effects are generally more pronounced at lower beta values, where magnetic pressure dominates; in particular, the $30^\circ$ case at $\beta = 0.001$ exhibits strong and persistent asymmetric inflows and outflows. Our results demonstrate that equatorially asymmetric magnetic field configurations can significantly influence the structure and variability of relativistic accretion flows. These findings motivate future extensions to full three-dimensional studies, where black hole magnetosphere can be explored in a more general setting.

#### The Bondi universe: How negative mass drives the cosmological expansion

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22910

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22910

 - **Abstract**
 We identify a new cosmological coincidence that parallels the well-known matter/dark-energy coincidence: the present-epoch transition of the universe from a weakly coupled (collisionless) to a strongly coupled (collisional) gravitational regime. Within a cosmological model containing equal amounts of positive and negative Bondi masses -- consistent with the weak equivalence principle and momentum conservation -- we show that this coupling transition naturally coincides with the shift from a coasting to an accelerating expansion. A linear response analysis of the corresponding Vlasov-Poisson system reveals that mixed positive-negative mass configurations are always unstable, with growth rates that increase at shorter wavelengths, thereby driving the system toward strong coupling. Using long-time, exact one-dimensional N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the universe undergoes three successive expansion phases: an initial ballistic regime, an intermediate random-walk acceleration driven by sporadic Bondi encounters, and finally a uniformly accelerating phase triggered by the formation of stable positive/negative mass pairs. The onset of this last phase occurs precisely when the coupling parameter crosses unity, linking the two cosmological coincidences through a single dynamical mechanism. These results suggest that cosmic acceleration may arise from the nonlinear dynamics of a gravitationally neutral mixed-mass universe, without invoking dark energy or a cosmological constant.

#### Linear perturbation theory and structure formation in a Brans-Dicke theory of gravity without dark matter

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22937

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the formation of the large-scale cosmic structure in a scalar-tensor theory of gravity belonging to the class of the Brans--Dicke theories. The universe contains baryonic matter alone and neither dark matter nor dark energy. The two arbitrary functions of the scalar field characterizing the kinetic term and the self-interaction potential are set to $W(\varphi)=-1$ and $V(\varphi) = -\Xi \varphi$, respectively, with $\Xi$ a positive constant. In the weak-field limit, the theory reduces to Refracted Gravity, a non-relativistic theory whose modified Poisson equation contains the scalar field $\varphi$ that provides the gravitational boost required to describe the dynamics of galaxies and galaxy clusters without dark matter. In a flat, matter-dominated, homogeneous and isotropic universe the same scalar field $\varphi$ drives the accelerated expansion of the universe and describes the observed redshift evolution of the Hubble-Lemaître parameter $H(z)$. However, in the equation of the growth factor of the linear perturbation theory, the form of $V(\varphi)$ makes the coefficient of the source of the gravitational field proportional to $H^{-1}(z)$; therefore the gravitational field is strongly suppressed at early times and structure formation is delayed to redshift $z< 1$, in disagreement with the observation of formed galaxies at much larger redshifts. In addition, the form of $W(\varphi)$ and a linear $V(\varphi)$ imply that $\varphi$ generates twice the gravitational boost on massive particles than on photons, with possible observable consequences on the gravitational lensing phenomenon. It remains to be investigated whether different choices of $W(\varphi)$ and $V(\varphi)$, that can still make the theory reduce to Refracted Gravity in the weak-field limit, might alleviate these problems.

#### Seeds of supermassive black holes in general relativistic and alternative cosmologies: Implications of massive seeds

 - **Abstract**
 Presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with mass $(10^{6}-10^{9}) M_{\odot}$ at $z = 10$ has been recently revealed by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations. In this study we generate seeds for the above range of SMBHs in various background cosmologies. We consider cosmic timescales required for black hole growth provided by three general relativistic cosmological models ($\Lambda$CDM, $\omega$CDM and Dynamical Dark Energy(DDE) and the braneworld cosmology. The growth of SMBHs is studied through Eddington limited and super-Eddington accretion, where the accretion starts at z=30. It is found that growth of SMBHs by z=10 within Eddington limited accretion is possible through massive seeds $(M\geq10^{4}M_{\odot})$ in all cosmologies. Super Eddington accretion onto spinning black holes with mass of few tens of solar masses can result in SMBHs by z=10 in all cosmologies. The viable cosmologies considered here are found to be unable to strongly distinguish between the seed black hole masses. The seeds generated in this work are assumed to be of primordial origin in order to satisfy the criteria of formation of high redshift massive galaxies. The fraction of primordial black holes (PBHs) contributing to dark matter ($f_{PBH}$) and their corresponding number densities for the mass range ($10^{5}-10^{8}$) $M_{\odot}$ are calculated in both seed effect and Poisson effect. In seed effect, PBHs of mass $\geq 10^{7} M_{\odot}$ contributes $\leq 10^{-2}$ to the dark matter fraction. The evolution of gas mass inside a PBH seeded dark matter halo is studied. The ratio of black hole to stellar mass is also evaluated for star formation efficiency in the range (0.1-1) and found to be ($10^{-3}-1$) for $M_{BH}=10^{8} M_{\odot}$ and ($10^{-2}-10$) for $M_{BH}=10^{9} M_{\odot}$.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a self-supervised approach for characterizing low surface brightness tidal features in wide-field imaging data by applying the nearest-neighbor contrastive learning of visual representations (NNCLR) algorithm to a curated subset of the Dark Energy Survey Data Release 2 (DES DR2). We construct 38,334 cutouts of well-resolved galaxies in the g, r, i bands, applying a novel "tiered sigmoid scaling function" to dynamically adjust image contrast according to the object's signal-to-noise and background level. A supplemental labeled sample of 366 galaxies enables qualitative assessment of the learned embeddings. We train a convolutional neural network with image augmentations including injection of simulated background stars, and project the resulting 512-dimensional representations into two dimensions using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and its local density preserving variant (densMAP). We find that the NNCLR latent space recovers global trends corresponding to major merger features, yet does not reliably separate stellar streams without further supervision. To interpret the network's implicit attention, we compute gradient-based saliency maps averaged over the full dataset: these reveal that the tiered sigmoid scaling effectively attenuates information from the center of the image cutouts, thereby suppressing the learning of high surface brightness features of each image cutout's central galaxy. Our study provides a blueprint for leveraging contrastive methods to mine forthcoming survey data for faint tidal substructure, and highlights key preprocessing and interpretability considerations for robust stream detection.

#### Too many or too massive? Investigating the high-$z$ demography of active SMBHs from JWST

 - **Abstract**
 Recent JWST observations have unveiled a numerous population of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) at $4< z<10$, with space densities roughly an order of magnitude above pre-JWST estimates, and many of these AGN have masses orders of magnitude above the local black hole mass-stellar mass ($M_{\rm BH}-M_{*}$) scaling relations. We investigate the consistency of these observations within a data-driven framework that links the galaxy stellar mass function to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass function and AGN luminosity functions using different $M_{\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations and the observed Eddington-ratio distribution. By comparing our predictions against observed AGN luminosity functions at $z\sim 5.5$ we find that observations can be reproduced either by highly-elevated $M_{\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations paired with low duty cycles, or moderate relations with higher duty cycles. Through the Soltan argument, we find that $M_{\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations that are modestly above the local relation for AGN produce consistency between multiple tracers of the SMBH demography at $z\sim 5.5$, while more extreme normalisations would require a weakly-evolving luminosity function at $z> 5.5$. Continuity-equation modelling shows that initially high $M_{\rm BH}-M_{*}$ relations predict a strong two-phase evolutionary scenario and very steep low-mass SMBH mass functions in tension with several current estimates, while more moderate relations generate local SMBH mass functions in better agreement with present determinations and near-constant scaling relations. Our results favour a scenario where SMBHs at $z \sim 5$ on average lie modestly above local AGN scaling relations, with elevated but physically plausible duty cycles. Future wide-field clustering and demographic studies will help break the remaining degeneracies between SMBH scaling relations and AGN duty cycles at early cosmic times.

 - **Abstract**
 Theoretical models of the evolution of supermassive black hole (SMBH) pairs in post-merger remnant galaxies are necessary to motivate observational searches for dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) and gravitational wave sources. Studies have explored the dynamical evolution of SMBH pairs under the influence of dynamical friction to calculate pairing times and predict the expected population of dual-AGNs at various redshifts. We formulate a three-dimensional dynamical model of SMBH pairs in the innermost kiloparsec of a post-merger galaxy to investigate the impact of orbital inclination with respect to the galactic disk on pairing times. The SMBH pairs are evolved in 81 different galaxy configurations initialized using a Gauss-Seidel Poisson solver. The dynamics are calculated for 12 distinct initial inclinations ranging from 0 to 75 degrees in each of the galaxies to gauge the impact of inclination on pairing time. Orbits characterized by initial inclinations greater than 20 degrees frequently require longer pairing times when compared to uninclined orbits. Pairing times for orbits with inclinations $\gtrsim 45$ degrees often exceed 14 Gyr. Galaxies with higher mass SMBH pairs and faster rotating disks generally shorten pairing times relative to galaxies with less massive or slower rotating disks when the inclination is $\lesssim 45$ degrees. The model suggests that SMBH pairs that form from mergers at inclinations $\lesssim 20$ degrees are likely progenitors of dual-AGN and gravitational wave sources.

#### Modified Teleparallel $f(T)$ Gravity, DESI BAO and the $H_0$ Tension

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate whether late-time modifications of gravity in the teleparallel framework can impact the current tension in the Hubble constant $H_0$, focusing on $f(T)$ cosmology as a minimal and well-controlled extension of General Relativity. We consider three representative $f(T)$ parametrisations that recover the teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity at early times and deviate from it only at late epochs. The models are confronted with unanchored Pantheon+ Type~Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, compressed Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, and redshift-space distortion data, allowing us to jointly probe the background expansion and the growth of cosmic structures. Two of the three models partially shift the inferred value of $H_0$ towards local measurements, while the third worsens the discrepancy. This behaviour is directly linked to the effective torsional dynamics, with phantom-like regimes favouring higher $H_0$ and quintessence-like regimes producing the opposite effect. A global statistical comparison shows that the minimal $f(T)$ extensions considered here are not favoured over $\Lambda$CDM by the combined data. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that late-time torsional modifications can non-trivially redistribute current cosmological tensions among the background and growth sectors.

 - **Abstract**
 In this contribution, we investigate the scattering cross sections of black holes immersed in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM). We present both the classical and semi-classical scattering cross sections for different values of the parameter that characterizes the PFDM contribution. Our results show that the presence of dark matter increases the classical scattering cross section and modifies the width of the interference fringes in the semi-classical regime. In addition, the scattering cross section is also computed using the partial wave method for the black holes considered, exhibiting similar qualitative behavior. These findings suggest that the effects of dark matter surrounding black holes may play an important role in black holes phenomenology, particularly in certain regions near the black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 We study grey-body factors and Hawking radiation of higher-dimensional regular black holes arising in quasi-topological gravity. These spacetimes incorporate infinite-curvature corrections that remove the central singularity while preserving an event horizon and a well-defined semiclassical description. We show that, for all considered regular black hole models, the transmission of radiation and the corresponding Hawking evaporation are significantly suppressed compared to the singular black hole solutions of General Relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 The final state of a binary black hole merger is predicted with high precision by numerical relativity, but could there be a simple thermodynamic principle within general relativity that governs the selection of the remnant? Using post-Newtonian relations between the mass M (including the binding energy) and angular momentum J of quasi-circular, nonspinning binaries, we uncover a puzzling result: When the binary's instantaneous M and J are mapped to those of a hypothetical Kerr black hole, the corresponding entropy exhibits a maximum during the evolution. This maximum occurs at values of M and J strikingly close to those of the final remnant predicted by numerical relativity. Consistent behavior is observed when using the relation between M and J obtained from numerical relativity evolution. Although this procedure is somewhat ad hoc, the agreement between the masses and spins of the final state obtained from numerical relativity and the results of this maximum entropy procedure is remarkable, with agreement to within a few percent when using either post-Newtonian or numerical relativity results for M and J. These findings allow us to propose an entropy maximization conjecture for binary black hole mergers, hinting that thermodynamic principles may govern the selection of the final black hole state.

 - **Abstract**
 Ultraspinning black holes have attracted considerable attention due to their super-entropic nature, and previous analyses -- mostly restricted to neutral cases and high-temperature regimes -- have suggested that such black holes are always thermodynamically unstable. In this work, we revisit the thermodynamic stability of ultraspinning black holes by performing a systematic analysis of the heat capacity in different ensembles over the full range of the horizon radius $r_H$, which were missed in earlier temperature-based analyses. We demonstrate for the first time that, contrary to earlier claims, ultraspinning black holes can admit thermodynamically stable regions, whose existence crucially depends on the spacetime dimension, the solution branch, and the presence of charge. In addition, we present the first application of the revised reverse isoperimetric inequality to ultraspinning black holes. Despite the violation of the original reverse isoperimetric inequality in this super-entropic regime, we find that the revised inequality remains applicable and imposes nontrivial constraints on the allowed parameter space, including an upper bound on the ultraspinning parameter $\mu$, strengthened lower bounds on the mass $m$, and upper bounds on both the charge $q$ and the AdS radius $l$. To ensure the consistency of the thermodynamic description, the conserved charges and the first law in the ultraspinning limit are derived using the Iyer-Wald formalism together with integrability conditions.

#### Holographic Dark Energy as a Source for Wormholes in Modified Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 Traversable wormhole solutions are explored in $f(\mathcal{R},\mathbb{T})$ gravity, a curvature--matter extension in which $\mathcal{R}$ is the Ricci scalar and $\mathbb{T}$ denotes the trace of the energy--momentum tensor. To generate explicit wormhole models, we prescribe holographic dark-energy densities based on entropy formalism proposed by Rényi, Moradpour, and Bekenstein--Hawking, namely \[ \rho_{\textit{R}} = \frac{\alpha}{4\alpha_1 r^4 c^2 \kappa}\ln\!\left(1+\pi \alpha_1 r^2\right), \qquad \rho_{\textit{M}} = \frac{\alpha}{4\pi r^2 c^2 \kappa \left(\pi \alpha_1 r^2 + 1\right)}, \qquad \rho_{\textit{BH}} = \frac{\alpha}{4 c^2 \kappa r^2}, \] with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carrying dimensions of $L^{-2}$. The corresponding shape functions obtained from the field equations satisfy the standard throat and flare-out requirements for traversability. We then study how varying $\alpha$ and $\beta$ affects (i) the balance of forces associated with equilibrium and (ii) the status of the energy conditions. In particular, the null energy condition is found to be violated, indicating that exotic matter (or an effective exotic sector) is required to support the wormhole geometry. The spatial structure of the solutions is further visualized through embedding surfaces.

 - **Abstract**
 We argue that the polynomial degeneracies of curvature invariants can act as geometric selection rules for spacetime singularities in modified theories of gravity. The degeneracies arise purely from the algebraic structure of Riemannian geometry and impose non-trivial constraints on the effective energy-momentum tensor. We derive these constraints for metric $f(R)$ gravity and a wide class of scalar-tensor theories to show that a singularity formation is generally occluded by curvature and/or scalar-induced anisotropies. Therefore, formation of a singularity in modified theories of gravity is not always a generic outcome but can occur only along algebraically admissible branches selected by Riemannian curvature invariants.

#### Scalar-tensor-vector gravity theory is tested by black hole photon rings

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the photon ring and shadow structure of the Reissner-Nordström black hole in the scalar-tensor-vector gravitational framework. The black hole is characterized by the ( MOG) parameter (\alpha) and the charge (Q). The study finds that as (\alpha) increases, the event horizon radius (r_h), photon sphere radius (r_{ph}), and critical impact parameter (b_{ph}) all increase, while these decrease as (Q) increases. The innermost stable circular orbit radius (r_{isco}) exhibits similar monotonic behavior. Ray-tracing shows that as (Q) increases, the impact parameter (b) interval between the lensing ring and photon ring widens; (b_{\text{ph}}) is non-degenerate, and the photon ring radius is uniquely determined by (\alpha) and (Q). Using $EHT$ constraints on (SgrA^*) and (M87^*), the bounds on (\alpha) and (Q) are derived. For (Q = 0), (0.5), and (1), the allowed ranges are (\alpha \in [0, 0.06]), ([0, 0.11]), and ([0.19, 0.36]), respectively. Radiative simulations show that for fixed (Q), larger (\alpha) leads to a larger, non-degenerate photon ring. The Schwarzschild case is approached only when both (\alpha) and (Q) are small. This provides a computational basis for testing modified black holes and offers a non-degenerate observational criterion for distinguishing quantum gravity models, consistent with current $EHT$ data. Future observations with $ngEHT$ and multi-band polarization can further test this. The results suggest that studying the photon ring structure of a Reissner-Nordström black hole in scalar-tensor-vector gravity provides a unique optical diagnostic for potential quantum-gravity tests and black hole properties.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational memory is a zero-frequency effect associated with a permanent change in the asymptotic spacetime metric induced by radiation. While its universal manifestation is a net change of proper distances, gravitational-wave detectors are intrinsically insensitive to the final offset and can only probe the associated transition. A central challenge for any claim of detection therefore lies in defining a physically meaningful and operationally robust model of this time-dependent signal, which is uniquely attributable to gravitational memory and distinguishable from purely oscillatory radiation. In this work, we propose a general solution to this challenge. Building on a self-contained review of the theory of gravitational memory, we discuss a theoretical framework for defining and modeling a gravitational memory rise, in particular applicable to compact binary coalescences. Specializing to space-based detectors, we analyze the response of LISA to gravitational radiation including a memory contribution, with particular emphasis on mergers of supermassive black hole binaries, which offer the most promising prospects for a first single-event detection. The framework developed here provides the theoretical foundation for statistically well-defined hypothesis testing between memory-free and memory-full radiation and quantitative assessments of detection prospects. As such, these results establish a principled pathway toward a future observational claim of gravitational memory.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy opens a new venue to explore the universe. Future observatories such as LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, are expected to observe previously undetectable fundamental physics effects in signals predicted by General Relativity (GR).One particularly interesting such signal is associated to the displacement memory effect, which corresponds to a permanent deformation of spacetime due to the passage of gravitational radiation. In this work, we explore the ability of LISA to observe and characterize this effect. In order to do this, we use state-of-the-art simulations of the LISA instrument, and we perform a Bayesian analysis to assess the detectability and establish general conditions to claim detection of the displacement memory effect from individual massive black hole binary (MBHB) merger events in LISA. We perform parameter estimation both to explore the impact of the displacement memory effect and to reconstruct its amplitude. We discuss the precision at which such a reconstruction can be obtained thus opening the way to tests of GR and alternative theories. To provide astrophysical context, we apply our analysis to black hole binary populations models and estimate the rates at which the displacement memory effect could be observed within the LISA planned lifetime.

#### Hairy black hole solutions in nonlocal quadratic gravity

 - **Abstract**
 Hairy black hole solutions are constructed within quantum-inspired nonlocal quadratic gravity. Nonlocal effects induce Yukawa screening, which shifts the event horizon inward and modifies both the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy and the Hawking temperature, while also renormalizing the chemical potential. Nonlocal corrections also reduce the magnitude of the negative specific heat, making small hairy black holes more stable, with Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies consistent with the absence of first-order phase transitions. The nonlocal spin-2 propagator contains, in addition to the massless graviton, a massive pole with positive residue and positive norm. Consequently, hairy black holes in nonlocal quadratic gravity are free of ghost instabilities at the quadratic and classical levels, in the effective field theory.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the chaos in the dynamics of a probe massless particle confined by the harmonic potential near the horizon of the dyonic $\rm{AdS_4}$-Reissner-Nordström black hole. The total energy of the particle, chemical potential and magnetic field in this system serving as independently adjustable parameters tune nonlinearity and phase-space structure. By analyzing the trajectories on the Poincaré section and evaluating the Lyapunov exponents, we obtain the dynamical phase diagrams of the chaos and find their counteracting regulatory role: at low energy, chaos is enhanced and the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L$ violates its upper bound (i.e. surface gravity) in the extremal black hole limit(combined paramete $\Gamma=3$); at high energy, the same extremal limit suppresses chaos, with $\lambda_L$ dropping to zero and a regular dynamical corridor emerging along $\Gamma=3$ in the dynamical phase diagrams. These results establish a direct mapping between black hole thermodynamics and microscopic chaos, offering new insights into the AdS/QCD correspondence and nonlinear dynamics in strongly curved spacetimes.

 - **Abstract**
 We present exact solutions of the Einstein-$SU(2)$ non-linear sigma model in $3+1$ spacetime dimensions, describing bumpy black holes and black branes. Using an Ansatz for superfluid pion multi-vortices, the matter sector reduces to a first-order BPS system, while the Einstein equations reduce to a Liouville equation with a smooth source governing the horizon deformation. These solutions describe horizons of different constant curvatures, with nontrivial bumpy geometries protected by an integer topological invariant, namely the vorticity, which also controls the number of bumps and the black hole thermodynamics. Remarkably, such horizons arise in a minimal and physically motivated matter model, without invoking exotic fields or modified gravity. The physical implications of these results in holography and astrophysics are briefly described.

#### Allowable complex metrics and the gravitational index of AdS$_5$ black holes

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the Kontsevich-Segal-Witten criterion for the allowability of complex metrics, in the context of the gravitational path integral that calculates the supersymmetric index. We focus on the saddle points that capture the contribution of supersymmetric black holes in AdS$_5$ space. We show that, for such black holes with two independent angular momenta, the conditions imposed on the corresponding saddle point by the KSW criterion are equivalent to the ones arising from the convergence of the microscopic trace form of the supersymmetric index. This result adds to previous results establishing such an equivalence in other, simpler examples of the gravitational index in AdS space and flat space. Along the way, we give a practical algorithm for implementing the KSW criterion in terms of eigenvalues of certain matrices.
