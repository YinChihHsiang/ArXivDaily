 - **Abstract**
 The realization that primordial black holes (PBHs) might be some fraction of the dark matter begged the question, how often do PBHs enter the solar system? For a Neptune radius solar system the answer is, rarely. For an Oort cloud sized system the answer is different. Simulations of bombardment of the Oort cloud by dark matter suggest that dislodgement of protocomets and their entry into the inner solar system can match the observed frequency of comets, if that PBH fraction is high enough. Comets were traditionally considered as messengers, usually omens. After 50 years of puzzlement regarding dark matter, we need a hint from the dark universe about the size and nature of dark matter particles.

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the mass distribution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) over cosmic time remains particularly challenging for the low mass ($M_{\bullet}\lesssim10^8~M_\odot$) population at $z>1$. This population is also the most sensitive to SMBH seeding and early growth models. In this work we construct a semi-empirical model for the redshift evolution of the TDE rate under multiple SMBH mass function prescriptions, and show that the observed redshift-dependent rate of TDEs is very sensitive to the SMBH mass function and its evolution with redshift. We further incorporate galaxy-scale processes that evolve with redshift -- namely, increasing galaxy nuclear stellar densities, enhanced galaxy-galaxy merger rates, dust obscuration, and a possible top-heavy IMF at early cosmic times -- and quantify their combined impact on the TDE rate. We find that including these effects generally results in a volumetric TDE rate that increases with redshift until a maximum near cosmic noon, before declining at higher redshift where SMBHs that can disrupt stars become increasingly scarce. We forecast TDE rates in the Rubin LSST and the Roman High Latitude Time Domain Survey, alongside expectations for serendipitous TDE rates in the JWST COSMOS-Web survey. Finally, we provide a methodology for using a flux-limited survey of TDEs in LSST to directly constrain the redshift evolution of the SMBH mass function.

 - **Abstract**
 We implement a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to obtain posterior probability distributions for the parameters of the S2 star orbit around Sagittarius A*, for seven representative non-rotating black hole space-time solutions. In particular, we consider the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström, Janis-Newman-Winicour, and Bardeen black hole space-times from General Relativity, as well as a black hole solution from Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, a hairy black hole solution from Horndeski theory, and a Yukawa-like black hole from $f(\mathscr{R})$ gravity. To constrain model parameters, we use the most recent publicly available observational data of the S2 star orbit, namely astrometric measurements, spectroscopic data, and the pericentre advance measured by the GRAVITY Collaboration. We further perform a consistent Bayesian comparison of models, calculating the log-Bayes factor of each space-time with respect to the Schwarzschild solution. Our results show that the currently available data indicate no statistically significant preference among the space-times considered. The Bardeen and Yukawa-like models are indistinguishable from Schwarzschild within current uncertainties, while the Reissner-Nordström, Janis-Newman-Winicour, Horndeski and Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton geometries show at most weak and non-decisive strength of evidence under the adopted priors and likelihood choices.

#### Growth of High-Redshift Quasars from Fermion Dark Matter Seeds

 - **Abstract**
 Quasars hosting $\gtrsim 10^{9}\,M_\odot$ black holes at $z>6$ challenge growth scenarios that start from light seeds and assume accretion within already formed galaxies. Motivated by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) discovery of Little Red Dots (LRDs), which suggests that $\sim 10^{6}\,M_\odot$ black holes can be active in compact, pre-galactic environments, we revisit early black hole growth with a minimal cosmology-based framework. We model the accretion history as the smaller of the Bondi inflow rate and the Eddington-limited rate, where the Bondi rate is set by the supply of overdense primordial gas whose density declines with cosmic expansion, and the Eddington rate captures regulation by radiative feedback. By fitting the observed masses and luminosities of J0313--1806 ($z=7.64$) and J0100+2802 ($z=6.30$) with Bayesian inference, we infer initial conditions that favor massive seed black holes with initial mass $M_0 \sim 10^{6}\,M_\odot$, formed at $z\sim20{-}30$ in environments with baryonic overdensity factors $f_\rho \gtrsim 50$ relative to the cosmic mean. The resulting growth histories include a prolonged supply-limited stage, and they reproduce the observed quasar masses without requiring sustained Eddington accretion or any super-Eddington episodes. The inferred seed mass scale is consistent with black holes produced by the collapse of quantum-degenerate fermion dark matter cores, providing a physically defined pathway to massive seeds at the redshifts implied by LRD phenomenology.

 - **Abstract**
 Neutron star binary mergers are often associated with short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), but the recent detection of kilonovae coincident with long GRBs suggest that some mergers may produce long GRBs. Motivated by these developments, we perform a search for binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole gravitational-wave signals coincident with long GRBs using data from the third LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) observing run. We analyze LVK data coincident with long GRBs detected by Fermi's GRB Monitor and Swift's Burst Alert Telescope when at least two gravitational-wave observatories were running. We find no evidence of a coincident gravitational-wave signal and set limits on the luminosity distance to each of these long GRBs under the assumption that they were powered by binary mergers.

#### A gamma-ray-emitting blazar B3 1239+376 at z = 3.82 identified in a multi-wavelength context

 - **Abstract**
 Among thousands of extragalactic $\gamma$-ray emitters, only a handful of distant ($z >$ 3) sources are detected, yet they are cruial probes shedding light on the cosmic evolution of jets of active galactic nuclei and the initial phase of mass growth of supermassive black holes. Here, we report on a multi-band study of a radio quasar B3 1239+376 with $z$ = 3.82. By analyzing the Fermi-LAT data, a significant (globally 7.7$\sigma$) $\gamma$-ray source in its direction, with an estimated association probability of 0.91, is observed in a half-year period of 2025. The analyses also reveal the emergence of co-spatial $\gamma$-ray residues in prior epochs. Moreover, the $\gamma$-ray and infrared light curves are likely correlated, particularly, the two emissions climb to the peaking values at the same time. The temporal coincidence establishes a firm association relationship between the $\gamma$-ray source and the quasar. Therefore, B3 1239+376 is proposed as the {\it third} most distant $\gamma$-ray-emitting blazar to date. Benefiting from the multi-wavelength observations, broadband spectral energy distributions in different flux states are drawn and reproduced by the classic one-zone leptonic radiation model to investigate the jet properties. Considering the recent brightening in $\gamma$ rays, prompt follow-up observations are encouraged, especially radio interferometry observations which may catch the potential ejection of a new jet blob.

#### Forecast on $f(R)$ Gravity with HI 21cm Intensity Mapping Surveys

 - **Abstract**
 Modified gravity theories offer a well-motivated extension of General Relativity and provide a possible explanation for the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. Among them, $f(R)$ gravity represents a minimal and theoretically appealing class, characterized by the Compton wavelength parameter $B_0$, which quantifies deviations from General Relativity. In this work, we explore the capability of future neutral hydrogen (HI) 21 cm intensity mapping (IM) observations to constrain $f(R)$ gravity at low redshifts. We perform Fisher-matrix forecasts for $B_0$ and standard cosmological parameters using upcoming 21 cm IM experiments, including BINGO and SKA1-MID (Band 1 and Band 2), both individually and in combination with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors. We find that even near-term experiments such as BINGO are able to place nontrivial bounds on $B_0$, $\sigma(B_0)\simeq 2.27\times 10^{-6}$, while SKA1-MID yields substantially tighter constraints, with SKA Band 2 providing the strongest sensitivity among the considered configurations, $\sigma(B_0)\simeq 6.37\times 10^{-8}$. We further demonstrate that the combination of low-redshift 21 cm IM data with CMB observations efficiently breaks degeneracies with background cosmological parameters and leads to a significant improvement in the constraints on $B_0$. These results highlight the potential of future HI intensity mapping surveys, in combination with CMB measurements, to provide stringent tests of General Relativity on cosmological scales.

#### Exploring the central engines of gamma-ray bursts from prompt light curves

 - **Abstract**
 Hyperaccreting stellar-mass black hole systems are leading candidates for the central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Their jets are thought to be powered by either the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process or neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs), but discriminating between these mechanisms remains challenging. To address this, we propose using the luminosity decay slope (parameter d) of GRB light curves to distinguish between the BZ and NDAF mechanisms, thereby linking the light-curve morphology to the central engine physics. By analysing 85 single-peaked GRBs with fast-rise, exponential-decay (FRED) profiles observed by Swift/BAT using 64 ms background-subtracted light curves, we fit the decay slope (parameter d) with the empirical Kocevski-Ryde-Liang (KRL) function and compare the results with theoretical predictions for the BZ (d approximately 1.67) and the NDAF (d approximately 3.7 to 7.8) mechanisms. We find that the decay slope (parameter d) can differentiate central engine mechanisms, with 15 GRBs consistent with the BZ mechanism and 22 supporting the NDAF mechanism. However, most events exhibit slopes within the range between 2 and 4, suggesting a hybrid of mechanisms, with NDAF being dominant.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel framework to infer the mass of clusters that host hierarchical binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected with gravitational-waves (GWs), on a single event basis. We show that the requirement that a second-generation (2G) remnant be retained, and subsequently undergo a dynamical encounter, places strong constraints on the mass of the cluster. Using a Plummer model as a readily interpretable baseline, we derive analytic scaling relations between the peak of the inferred host mass posterior, the GW-driven recoil velocity of the remnant, and the parameters that determine the structure of the host. We then perform exact numerical marginalization over thermal and recoil velocities, angles, and cluster structure parameters, to infer the host-mass posterior. We apply our framework to putative hierarchical mergers GW241011 and GW241110, and infer the masses of their hosts on a single-event basis. We find that these are consistent with either heavy globular clusters or nuclear star clusters, with inferred masses spanning $10^{5.7 - 7.7} M_{\odot}$ at $68\%$ confidence depending on the 2G recoil velocity distribution used.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we examine the motion of test particles and relativistic accretion mechanisms within the spacetime of a rotating and embedded BH. In this case, the geometric properties of the metric and their dynamical consequences for particle trajectories are systematically studied, with a specific focus on circular orbits together with their existence criteria and stability constraints. Also, the effective potential and the corresponding effective force are constructed to quantify the influence of rotation and embedding parameters on the attractive and repulsive sectors of the gravitational interaction. Closed-form expressions for orbital frequencies as measured by a distant observer are derived, enabling a quantitative analysis of relativistic precession phenomena, including periastron advance and Lense-Thirring precession. Furthermore, we conduct general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of BHL accretion onto rotating embedded BHs. In addition, within the framework of the BHL accretion mechanism, the numerical solution of the GRH equations shows that the embedding parameter \alpha systematically modifies the morphology of the shock cone formed around embedded BHs compared to the Kerr model. In particular, a wider opening angle of the cone is produced, the compression of matter in the post-shock region is weakened, and the dynamical variability of the flow is enhanced. The time-dependent mass accretion rate exhibits increasing oscillation amplitudes and long-term variations with increasing \alpha, while these amplitudes are found to be suppressed by the frame-dragging effect associated with the BH spin parameter. At the same time, increasing values of $\alpha$ lead to a strengthening of the QPO frequencies formed around embedded BHs in the LFQPO regime, enhancing their observability and increasing the likelihood of detecting commensurate frequency ratios such as 3:2.

 - **Abstract**
 We present updated microlensing analysis results based on high-cadence ($\sim$2~min) Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) in 2014, 2017, and 2020, yielding a total of 39.3 hours of data. We use a point-lens finite-source model for the microlensing light curve model and employ multi-stage selection procedures to identify microlensing candidates. From more than 25,000 variable candidates detected across all nights, we identify 12 microlensing candidates with light-curve timescales shorter than 5~hours, and among them, 4 secure candidates with high-significance detections. We estimate detection efficiencies using light-curve-level simulations that account for observational conditions and finite-source effects. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework that combines the light-curve fitting information for each candidate with the Poisson statistics of the number of candidates, we derive constraints on parameters that characterize the abundance and mass scale of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter. First, we derive upper limits on the PBH abundance under the null hypothesis that all events are assumed to be false detections. Next, employing the PBH hypothesis in which all (or only secure) candidates are assumed to be due to PBH microlensing, we derive the allowed region of the PBH parameters; the inferred mass scale is $M_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{-7}$--$10^{-6}M_\odot$, and the PBH abundance to the total dark matter is $f_{\rm PBH}\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-2}{\rm -}10^{-1})$. Our results demonstrate that HSC-M31 monitoring remains a uniquely powerful probe of PBHs, and highlight the need for further studies for example, using Rubin Observatory LSST observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud.

#### Early growth of massive black holes in dynamical dark energy models with negative cosmological constant

 - **Abstract**
 Recent results from combined cosmological probes indicate that the Dark Energy component of the Universe could be dynamical. The simplest explanation envisages the presence of a quintessence field rolling into a potential, where the Dark Energy energy density parameter $\Omega_{DE}=\Omega_{\Lambda}+\Omega_{x}$ results from the contribution of the ground state energy $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ and the scalar field energy $\Omega_{x}$. Provided that $\Omega_{DE}\approx 0.7$, negative values of $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ can be consistent with current measurements from cosmological probes, and could help in explaining the large abundance of bright galaxies observed by JWST at $z> 10$, largely exceeding the pre-JWST expectations in a $\Lambda CDM$ Universe. Here we explore to what extent such a scenario can account also for the early presence of massive Black Holes (BHs) with masses $M_{BH}\gtrsim 10^7\,M_{\odot}$ observed at $z\gtrsim 8$, and for the large over-abundance of AGN with respect to pre-JWST expectations. Our aim is not to provide a detailed description of BH growth, but rather to compute the maximal BH growth that can occur in cosmological models with negative $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ under the simple assumption of Eddington-limited accretion onto initial light Black Hole seeds with mass $M_{seed}\sim 10^2\,M_{\odot}$ originated from PopIII stars. To this aim we develop a simple analytic framework to connect the growth of dark matter halos to the maximal growth of BHs within the above assumptions. We show such models can account for present observations assuming values of $\Omega_{\Lambda}\approx -1$, simultaneously boosting both galaxy and AGN number counts without invoking any additional physics. This would allow us to trace the observed excess of bright and massive galaxies and the early formation of massive Black Holes and the abundance of AGN to the same cosmological origin.

#### Water absorption confirms cool atmospheres in two little red dots

 - **Abstract**
 Little red dots (LRDs) are an abundant population of compact high-redshift sources with red rest-frame optical continua, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Their red colors and power sources have been attributed either to dust reddening of standard hot accretion disks or to intrinsically cool thermal emission from dense hydrogen envelopes, in both cases surrounding accreting supermassive black holes. These scenarios predict order-of-magnitude differences in emission temperature but have lacked decisive temperature diagnostics. Here we report a prominent absorption feature at rest-frame $\sim 1.4 \, \mu\mathrm{m}$ in two out of four LRDs at $z \sim 2$ with high signal-to-noise JWST spectra, among the coolest from a large LRD sample. The feature matches the shape and wavelength of the water absorption band seen in cool stars. Atmosphere models require $T \lesssim 3000\, \mathrm{K}$ to reproduce it, confirming unambiguously the presence of a cool, dense gas component contributing $20-30\%$ to the emergent continuum. A composite model reproduces both the absorption and the rest-frame optical-to-infrared continuum shape and suggests a temperature range ($\sim2000\, \mathrm{K} - 4000 \, \mathrm{K}$) rather than a single blackbody predicted by some gas envelope models. Molecular absorption demonstrates that the red continua of some LRDs are intrinsic rather than dust-reddened, implying order-of-magnitude lower bolometric luminosities and black-hole masses, and providing a new diagnostic of the emitting gas.

#### ACT DR6+Planck impact on inflation with non-zero vacuum expectation value and the post-inflationary behavior

 - **Abstract**
 The impact of the most recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) is studied for a model of cosmic inflation which predicts a non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) $M$ for a large-field regime. Since lower values of $M$ are compatible with the higher spectral index $n_s$ provided by the ACT+Planck joint analysis, we establish new limits on this parameter while also considering further CMB data from the latest BICEP/Keck Array release for CMB polarization modes. We find $\log_{10}M/M_{Pl}=-2.5^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$ at 68\% confidence level, compatible with $M/M_{Pl}\simeq 0.003$, which is interesting for post-inflationary processes, such as preheating. We conduct a lattice simulation for the inflaton field for the first few e-folds, as the model is compatible with the production of relics such as oscillons, which are possible candidates as sources of gravitational waves and primordial black holes. We find that the model indeed produces localized, quasi-spherical structures compatible with oscillons, which might lead to signatures detectable by future experiments. However, in agreement with recent works, we find that although the abundance of gravitational waves that could be generated in this regime has an amplitude well within the sensitivities of these detectors, the frequency range is on the GHz limit, away from the expected frequencies. Finally, we estimate the impact of a coupling of the type $y\phi\sigma^2$ to the inflaton, in the realization of perturbative reheating, directly impacting the predictions of the model, as lower values of $M$ are consistent with both the entire allowed temperature range, and the limits imposed by BICEP/Keck Array+Planck+ACT.

 - **Abstract**
 We study Oppenheimer-Snyder (OS) gravitational collapse matched to a general static, spherically symmetric exterior spacetime. Unlike the Schwarzschild case, two new features can arise in black holes with two horizons: an apparent-horizon left vertex, a temporary minimum in the apparent-horizon radius during collapse, and a bounce, where the star surface stops collapsing at a nonzero radius and reverses into expansion. We identify the conditions that lead to these two features. For two-horizon exteriors, trapped-region consistency requires that the apparent-horizon turning point occurs no earlier than the surface crossing of the inner horizon. As a concrete example, the OS collapse of the Reissner-Nordström (RN) spacetime shows both effects. In contrast, regular black holes with de Sitter cores show neither: their collapse is smooth and monotonic, and the surface approaches the center only as the proper time goes to infinity. These results naturally classify the OS collapses into three categories: singular, which ends at the center in finite time; bouncing, which reverses at a finite radius; and soft-landing, which reaches the center only asymptotically. We argue that these features are consistent with Penrose's strong cosmic censorship conjecture.

#### Suppression of Gravitational-Wave Echoes in Diffeomorphism-Invariant Nonlocal Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 Searches for late--time gravitational--wave echoes following compact binary mergers are often interpreted as probes of exotic near--horizon or horizonless physics. We show that a well--motivated class of ultraviolet--finite quantum gravity and modified gravity theories, those based on diffeomorphism--invariant, analytic, entire--function nonlocality, generically suppress observable echo signals. The suppression follows from Paley--Wiener bounds associated with the analyticity of the nonlocal regulator, which enforce exponential damping of high--frequency reflection amplitudes and smear sharp effective potentials in the black--hole interior. We demonstrate that for regular black holes with horizons, the standard ingoing boundary condition eliminates the cavity required for echoes, while for regular horizonless compact objects the nonlocal kernel strongly attenuates both inner and photon--sphere reflections. As a result, repeated reflections during the ringdown phase are exponentially suppressed in frequency space and washed out in the time domain. Our results imply that the absence of echoes in current gravitational--wave data is consistent with covariant nonlocal gravity theories and does not, by itself, favor classical horizons over regular or horizonless ultraviolet completions. The analyticity and Paley--Wiener bounds that enforce echo suppression are required to ensure unitarity, ghost freedom, and ultraviolet finiteness of the underlying quantum theory. As a result, the classical ringdown phenomenology already encodes quantum--gravity consistency conditions. We emphasize that the absence of echoes in such theories does not rely on quantum decoherence or stochastic effects, but instead reflects the analytic structure imposed by quantum gravity on the classical limit.

#### On the instability of the fundamental mode of the Regge-Wheeler effective potential

 - **Abstract**
 It was recently pointed out that the fundamental mode of the Regge-Wheeler effective potential is unstable against an insignificant Gaussian metric perturbation, which, in turn, might substantially challenge the black hole spectroscopy. This intriguing result has been interpreted by some authors as arising from essentially replacing the black hole's effective potential and its perturbation with two disjoint potential barriers. We argue that such an analysis may have oversimplified the real physical scenario. To be more precise, a metric perturbation planted farther away from the black hole horizon might not always be appropriately approximated by a disjoint minor barrier. Particularly, for the perturbed Pöschl-Teller potential, joint and disjoint metric perturbations might lead to drastically different stability properties for the low-lying modes. Following this line of thought, this study conducts a refined analysis of the stability of the fundamental mode of the Regge-Wheeler effective potential by closely examining a few physically relevant ingredients. While our analysis qualitatively confirms the main findings of previous studies, as the stability of the fundamental mode is primarily determined by the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequency, we show that specific features of both the effective potential at spatial infinity and the metric perturbation can have a sizable impact on the instability. In contrast, the spiral period, governed by the real part of the quasinormal frequency, appears largely insensitive to the details of the black hole metric or its perturbations. The analytic estimates are in reasonable agreement with the numerical results.

 - **Abstract**
 A Reissner-Nordström black hole (RNBH) enclosed in a cavity is known to be superradiantly unstable to charged scalar perturbations below a critical frequency. Inspired by the emergence of the QCD axion as a prominent dark matter candidate, we construct a model featuring an axion field coupled to an electromagnetic field that undergoes superradiant growth around an RNBH. Utilizing numerical relativity, we achieve stable, long-term evolution of this system and perform a comparative analysis across various parameter spaces. Our comprehensive investigation reveals the formation of a hairy black hole, whose final state is governed by a diverse set of physical parameters. Notably, the decay constant in the axion potential, representing nonlinear interactions, bifurcates the superradiant instability into two distinct behavioral regimes, leading to more significant dynamical shifts than previously reported. Furthermore, we examine the influence of the scalar field's charge and mass, as well as the mirror's position. We investigate the axionic bosenova process and observe a long-term beating pattern of the axion field induced by nonlinear interactions. By fine-tuning these parameter combinations, we demonstrate that the system can evolve toward a variety of distinct physical endpoints.

 - **Abstract**
 We study perturbations induced by a light particle scattering off a Schwarzschild black hole. Exploiting recent results for the wave propagation in this geometry, we derive the fields that this process induces on the horizon to leading order in the post-Minkowskian (PM) regime, when the light probe is far from the black hole. We then use these results to calculate the fluxes of energy and angular momentum that enter the black hole. We consider the effects due to gravitational, electromagnetic and scalar radiation, finding agreement with recent computations of the absorbed energy, while the absorbed angular momentum provides a new PM result.

 - **Abstract**
 The horizon multipole moments of a Kerr black hole are computed from two distinct definitions that have been proposed in the literature. The first one [Ashtekar et al., Class. Quantum Grav. 21, 2549 (2004)] regards axisymmetric isolated horizons, while the second one [Ashtekar et al., J. High Energ. Phys. 2022, 28 (2022)] applies to generic (i.e., not necessarily axisymmetric) non-expanding horizons. We review these definitions in a common frame and perform a detailed study of the resulting multipole moments for the Kerr event horizon. The horizon multipoles are found to share several properties with the (Hansen) field multipoles, including parity constraints and the leading scaling behavior with respect to the Kerr spin parameter a in the regime of small a. For the axisymmetry-based definition, we have obtained a closed-form expression of the multipole moments in terms of a and the spherical harmonic degree l. For the generic definition, we have established closed-form expressions for the conformal unit round metric, the `electric' and `magnetic' potentials related to the multipoles, and the values of the multipoles in the small a limit. We show that the two definitions lead to different values of the Kerr horizon multipoles as soon as l >= 1 (generic nonzero value of a) or l >= 2 (small a limit).

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we study the relationship between quantum random walks on graphs and Krylov/spread complexity. We show that the latter's definition naturally emerges through a canonical method of reducing a graph to a chain, on which we can identify the usual Krylov structure. We use this identification to construct families of graphs corresponding to special classes of systems with known complexity features and conversely, to compute Krylov complexity for graphs of physical interest. The two main outcomes are the analytic computation of the Lanczos coefficients for the SYK model for an arbitrary number $q$ of interacting fermions and the complete characterization of Krylov complexity for the hypercube graph in any number of dimensions. The latter serves as the starting point for an in-depth comparison between Krylov and circuit complexities as they purportedly arise in the context of black holes. We find that while under certain conditions Krylov complexity follows the growth and saturation pattern ascribed to such systems, the timescale at which saturation happens can generally be shorter than what is predicted by random unitary circuits, due to the effects of quantum speed-ups commonly occurring when comparing quantum and classical random walks.

 - **Abstract**
 In thermodynamics, a Legendre transformation of the free energy provides a mapping between different statistical ensembles. In this work, we demonstrate that performing a Legendre transformation of the black hole on-shell action is equivalent to imposing different boundary conditions on the fields. Consequently, the choice of ensemble must be consistent with, and cannot contradict, the imposed boundary conditions. From this perspective, it follows that for four-dimensional dyonic black holes, the on-shell action can only be expressed either as a function of the electric charge and the magnetic potential, or alternatively as a function of the magnetic charge and the electric potential. Inspired by the Legendre transformation of the Maxwell field, we argue that for purely gravitational theories whose metric geometries admit a \(U(1)\) fiber bundle structure, i.e.\ rotating, boosted, or Kaluza-Klein monopole configurations, one can similarly introduce appropriate Legendre terms, in the sense of dimensional reduction, to modify the thermodynamic ensemble of the black hole. Within the dimensional reduction framework, we study the on-shell action of black holes in five-dimensional minimal supergravity with a Chern-Simons term, analyze the corresponding Legendre transformation procedure, and show how the resulting formulation remains consistent with the Wald formalism.

 - **Abstract**
 We advocate for a holographic definition of thermodynamic pressure and volume for black holes based on quasi-local gravitational thermodynamics. When a black hole is enclosed by a finite timelike boundary, York's quasi-local first law includes a surface pressure conjugate to the boundary area. Assuming the existence of a holographically dual theory living on this boundary, these geometric quantities correspond to the pressure and volume of the dual thermal system. In this work we focus on static, spherically symmetric black holes, for which these quantities reduce to global thermodynamic variables. The holographic volume provides a notion of system size, allowing extensivity to be defined in standard thermodynamic terms, and it yields a definition of the large-system limit. For the asymptotically flat case, we show that, in the canonical thermodynamic representation, small Schwarzschild black holes are non-extensive, whereas large black holes become extensive in the large-system limit. A similar conclusion applies to Anti-de-Sitter Schwarzschild black holes, with the difference that the quasi-local energy of the large black hole also becomes extensive in the large-system limit. Before this limit, the energy decomposes into subextensive and extensive contributions, and we derive an explicit expression for the extensive part as a function of the finite volume and entropy.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we apply the thermodynamic topology framework to ultraspinning Kerr-AdS black holes in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. By constructing the off-shell Helmholtz free energy and the associated vector field, black hole states are characterized as topological defects, and their phase structures are described through zero points, winding numbers, and asymptotic thermodynamic behavior. Analyses of the four- and five-dimensional cases highlight the differences between even- and odd-dimensional configurations, while representative higher-dimensional cases confirm that no additional topological classes or subclasses emerge. We find that only two thermodynamic topological structures appear: the standard class $W^{1+}$ for most configurations, and the distinct subclass $\tilde{W}^{1+}$ for odd-dimensional black holes with maximal rotations. These results establish a unified, dimension-independent classification scheme for ultraspinning Kerr-AdS black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 The Euclidean Gravitational Path Integral has proven remarkably effective in the quantum regime of black hole physics. In this work, we examine the applicability of the Kontsevich-Segal-Witten (KSW) criterion for admissible complex metrics in the context of the Euclidean Gravitational Path Integral. We find that, for the super-conformal index of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM with unequal angular momenta, the black hole saddle points violate the KSW criterion precisely where the statistical description of the index breaks down. The corresponding critical point coincides with a phase transition into two-component ``grey galaxy'' configurations in the micro-canonical ensemble.
