#### Spectral Uniformity of Little Red Dots: A Natural Outcome of Coevolving Seed Black Holes and Nascent Starbursts

 - **Abstract**
 The birth of seeds of massive black holes (BHs) and nascent galaxies at cosmic dawn takes place in dense gaseous environments, which play a crucial role in shaping their coevolution and radiation spectra. We investigate gas accretion during the assembly of massive halos with $M_{\rm h}\gtrsim 10^{10-11}~M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\simeq 4-10$, driving both rapid BH feeding and concurrent nuclear starbursts. As the BH grows to $\sim 10^{6-7}~M_\odot$ via super-Eddington accretion, the accretion power inflates a dense envelope whose effective temperature approaches the Hayashi limit at $T_{\rm eff}\simeq 5000~{\rm K}$, producing red optical emission, while a coeval young stellar population of $\sim 10^7~M_\odot$ provides blue UV emission. This early coevolving system naturally reproduces the characteristic spectral features of the so-called little red dots (LRDs), a population of broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs), including the V-shaped UV-to-optical spectra and weakness of X-ray, infrared, and radio emission. Massive stars in the nuclear starburst soon explode as supernovae, injecting energy and momentum that expel gas from the nucleus, quench gas supply to the BH envelope, and ultimately drive a transition into normal AGN phases. For individual LRDs, the optical-to-UV luminosity ratio remains nearly constant at $L_{\rm opt}/L_{\rm UV}\simeq 2-10$ from the onset of accretion bursts for $\simeq 15~{\rm Myr}$, one-third of the Salpeter time, until quenching by stellar feedback. While this ratio is sustained for the LRD population at $z\simeq 4-8$, it declines toward lower redshifts as BHs can no longer maintain red envelopes, thereby losing the LRD characteristics.

 - **Abstract**
 Early JWST observations have revealed a high-redshift universe more vibrant than predicted by canonical galaxy-formation models within $\Lambda$CDM, showing an excess of ultraviolet(UV)-bright, massive, and morphologically mature galaxies. Departures from $\Lambda$CDM prior to recombination can imprint signatures on non-linear structure formation at high redshift. In this paper, we investigate one such scenario - Early Dark Energy, originally proposed to resolve the Hubble tension - and its implications for these high-redshift challenges. We present the first large-scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of these models. Modifications to the pre-recombination expansion history accelerate early structure formation and produce UV luminosity and stellar mass functions in excellent agreement with JWST measurements, requiring essentially no additional calibrations. Predictions converge to $\Lambda$CDM at lower redshifts ($z \lesssim 3$), thereby preserving all successes of $\Lambda$CDM. This model also accelerates the emergence of stellar and gaseous disks, increasing their number densities by $\sim 0.5$ dex at $z\simeq 6$-7, primarily due to the higher abundance of massive galaxies. Taken together, these results demonstrate how early-universe physics can simultaneously reconcile multiple high-redshift challenges and the Hubble tension while retaining the core achievements of $\Lambda$CDM. This opens a pathway to constraining a broad class of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models with forthcoming observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Infrared (IR) fine-structure line (FSL) emission arises from the radiative de-excitation of collisionally-excited electrons in atoms and ions. Thanks to their high luminosities and relatively simple physics, IR FSLs have quickly become the workhorse for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies in the nearby and distant Universe. In this review, we introduce the physics of FSL emission and the diagnostics of the ISM that we can derive from them via first principle arguments. We summarize the history of FSL observations with a focus on the far-IR wavelengths and a particular emphasis on the on-going efforts aimed at characterizing galaxies at cosmic noon and beyond. We explore the dependence of emission line trends, such as those observed in `line deficits' or [CII]-SFR relations, as a function of redshift and galaxy types. Once selection biases are controlled for, IR FSLs are a powerful tool to constrain the physics of galaxies. The precise redshift information inferred from fine-structure line observations have enabled tracing their ISM properties across cosmic reionization. FSL observations have also led to estimates of the mass of different ISM phases, and of the SFR of distant galaxies. It is thanks to IR FSL observations that we have been able to measure the internal dynamics of high-z galaxies, which in turns has allowed us to test, e.g., the onset of black hole - host galaxy relations in the first billion years of the Universe and the presence of gas outflows associated with the baryon cycle in galaxies. Finally, FSLs have provided important clues on the physics of the ISM in the most distant galaxies known to date. We demonstrate the strength and limitations of using IR FSLs to advance our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in the early universe, and we outline future perspective for the field.

#### Gravitational Waves from Hyperbolic Encounters of Primordial Black Holes in Dwarf Galaxies

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19462

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by primordial black holes (PBHs) in the dense cores of dwarf galaxies (DGs), considering both hierarchical binary black hole (BBH) mergers and close hyperbolic encounters (CHEs). Extending our previous merger framework, we incorporate up to four successive generations of PBHs within a Hubble time and quantify the GW emission from both channels. Our results show that while BBHs dominate the total emission, CHEs occur earlier, provide the first GW signals, and contribute a continuous though subdominant background that becomes relatively more significant once the initial PBH population is depleted and binary formation is suppressed. We compute the resulting SGWB spectra, demonstrating that BBHs and CHEs imprint distinct frequency dependencies consistent with analytical expectations. We then compare the predicted signals with the sensitivity of observatories such as LISA, DECIGO, ET, IPTA, and SKA. The numerical implementation is publicly available at \href{this https URL}.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the joint mass-redshift evolution of the binary black hole merger rate in the latest gravitational-wave detection catalog, GWTC-4.0. We present and apply a novel non-parametric framework for modeling multi-dimensional, correlated distributions based on Delaunay triangulation. Crucially, the complexity of the model -- namely, the number, positions, and weights of triangulation nodes -- is inferred directly from the data, resulting in a highly efficient approach that requires about one to two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and significantly less calibration than current state-of-the-art methods. We find no evidence for a peak at $M_{\mathrm{tot}} \sim 70\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ at low redshift ($z \sim 0.2$), where it would correspond to the $m_1 \sim 35\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ feature reported in redshift-independent mass spectrum analyses, and we infer an increased merger rate at high redshift $(z \sim 1)$ around those masses, compatible with such a peak. We discuss the astrophysical implications of these results.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a structural analysis of bulges in dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies. Dual AGN arise in galaxy mergers where both supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are actively accreting. The AGN are typically embedded in compact bulges, which appear as luminous nuclei in optical images. Galaxy mergers can result in bulge growth, often via star formation. The bulges can be disky (pseudobulges), classical bulges, or belong to elliptical galaxies. Using SDSS DR18 gri images and GALFIT modelling, we performed 2D decomposition for 131 dual AGN bulges (comprising 61 galaxy pairs and 3 galaxy triplets) identified in the GOTHIC survey. We derived sérsic indices, luminosities, masses, and scalelengths of the bulges. Most bulges (105/131) are classical, with sérsic indices lying between $n=2$ and $n=8$. Among these, 64% are elliptical galaxies, while the remainder are classical bulges in disc galaxies. Only $\sim$20% of the sample exhibit pseudobulges. Bulge masses span $1.5\times10^9$ to $1.4\times10^{12}\,M_\odot$, with the most massive systems being ellipticals. Galaxy type matching shows that elliptical--elliptical (E--E) and elliptical--disc (E--D) mergers dominate over disc--disc (D--D) mergers. At least one galaxy in two-thirds of the dual AGN systems is elliptical and only $\sim$30% involve two disc galaxies. Although our sample is limited, our results suggest that dual AGN preferentially occur in evolved, red, quenched systems, that typically form via major mergers. They are predominantly hosted in classical bulges or elliptical galaxies rather than star-forming disc galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the Quasar Main Sequence (QMS) by investigating the impact of the stellar component from the host galaxy (HG) on the emission line spectra of the active galactic nuclei (AGN). We first detect spectra with broad emission lines using a line ratio method for a sample of $\sim$3000 high SNR ($>$20) Black Hole Mapper objects (part of the fifth phase of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey). We then built the Index diagram, a novel diagnostic tool using the $z$-corrected spectra, model-free, designed to easily identify spectra with significant stellar HG contributions and to classify the AGN spectra into three categories based on AGN-HG dominance: HG-dominated (HGD), Intermediate (INT), and AGN-dominated (AGND) sources. A colour-$z$ diagram was used to refine the AGN-HG classification. We subtract the stellar contributions from the HGD and INT spectra before modeling the AGN spectrum to extract the QMS parameters. Our QMS reveals that HGD galaxies predominantly occupy the Population B region with no \rfe, %FWHM$\gtrsim$4000 \kms, with outliers exhibiting \rfe\ $>$ 1, likely due to HG subtraction residuals and a faint contribution of \hbbc. INT and AGND spectra show similar distributions in the Population A %FWHM(\hbbc)$<$4000 \kms\ region, while in Population B, %For broader lines, a tail of AGND sources becomes apparent. Cross-matching with radio, infrared, and X-ray catalogs, we find that the strongest radio emitters are associated with HGD and INT groups. Strong X-ray emitters are found in INT and AGND sources, also occupying the AGN region in the WISE colour diagram.

 - **Abstract**
 From a secular Hamiltonian up to the quadrupole level with general relativity (GR), we study nodal circulations with orbital flips of test particles of the Habitable Zone (HZ) around a solar-mass star, which are perturbed by an inner planetary-mass companion. Nodal circulations with orbital flips of an HZ test particle with eccentricity e2 are possible for any mass m1 and eccentricity e1 of the inner perturber and a suitable inclination i2. In particular, the greater the values of m1 and e2 , the smaller the minimum extreme inclination i2 capable of producing nodal circulations with orbital flips for each e1. As long as nodal librations with orbital flips are not possible for any i2, the greater the values of m1, e1, and e2, the larger the region of the plane ({\Omega}2, i2) associated with nodal circulations with orbital flips. If nodal librations with orbital flips occur, the region of the plane ({\Omega}2, i2) referred to nodal circulations with orbital flips increases with a decrease in m1 and e2, and with an increase in e1. We observe very good agreements between the analytical criteria and the N-body experiments for m1 ranging from Earth-mass planets to super-Jupiters, and small and moderate e2. The main discrepancies are found for high e2, which are more evident with an increase in m1 and e1.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how active galactic nuclei (AGN) affect their host galaxies requires determining their total radiative power across all wavelengths (i.e., bolometric luminosities). We show how AGN accretion disk spectral energy distribution (SED) templates, parameterized by supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, Eddington ratio, spin, and inclination, can be used to estimate total radiated luminosities. Bolometric luminosities are calculated by integrating the accretion disk SEDs from 1$\mu$m to 10keV over $0^\circ$--$90^\circ$ inclinations, ensuring consistent treatment of wavelength gaps, avoiding double-counting reprocessed emission, and accounting for anisotropy of visible--UV emission at different inclinations. The SED, and resulting bolometric corrections, depend strongly on SMBH mass and Eddington ratio, but only weakly on spin and inclination. Increasing SMBH mass produces cooler disks peaking at lower frequencies, whereas higher Eddington ratios (and spins) yield hotter disks peaking at higher frequencies. Larger inclinations suppress the visible--UV portion of the SED, whereas X-ray emission remains nearly isotropic. Bolometric corrections in the visible--NUV range (5100Å-3000Å) show strong dependence on SMBH mass, while X-ray bolometric corrections depend strongly on the Eddington ratio. Near the SED peak (FUV; $\sim$1450Å), parameter dependencies are weak, making this band particularly robust for estimating bolometric corrections. The X-ray band is reliable, though dependence on the Eddington ratio introduces a wide dynamic range. Because our SEDs are intrinsic and defined in the rest-frame, their application to Type 1 AGN is straightforward. For other AGN, however, corrections for obscuration by the host galaxy and torus are required in many cases.

#### Calibration-independent consistency test of DESI DR2 BAO and SNIa

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the consistency between DESI DR2 BAO and three SNIa datasets, Pantheon+, Union3, and DES-Y5. Our consistency test is {calibration}-independent since it is independent of cosmological nuisance parameters such as the absolute peak magnitude $M_B$ and the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch $r_d$. {This could reduce some systematics in the observed data, if present}. Importantly, the test is also model-agnostic, independent of any model of dark energy or modified gravity. We define a tension parameter to quantify tension across different datasets compared to DESI DR2 BAO. The Pantheon+ and Union3 data have tension $\lesssim\! 1\sigma$ across their redshift ranges, whereas the DES-Y5 tension is $\gtrsim3\sigma$ near $z=1$. This hints that DES-Y5 data has significant offset values for redshifts close to 1, compared to the other SNIa datasets. Since this consistency test is independent of cosmological nuisance parameters, the tension is minimal: other consistency tests involving differences in nuisance parameters may show greater tension.

#### Dynamical properties of oscillating, viscous, transonic accretion disks around black holes

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the time evolution of sub-Keplerian transonic accretion flow onto a non-rotating black hole using axisymmetric viscous hydrodynamic simulations. We simulate the accretion flow using boundary values from semi-analytical analysis and set up three different models. Two of the models do not predict accretion shocks from the semi-analytic analysis, while one of them does. We also consider radiative cooling along with viscosity in the simulation. Our two-dimensional simulation deviated from the one-dimensional semi-analytical solution and admitted shocks in all three models. Viscous dissipation tends to push the shock front outward, and radiative cooling will push it in. Additionally, gravity is attractive. Depending on the competing strengths of all three processes, it may trigger shock oscillation. Different rates of angular-momentum transport in various layers may trigger eddies, which will enhance the shock oscillation. We show that any simple power law cannot approximate these solutions. We find that hot and higher angular-momentum flow requires higher viscosity to produce oscillatory shocks. From the temporal variation of the luminosity, shock oscillations generate QPOs in the range of sub-Hertz to a few Hertz frequencies if a ten solar mass black hole is assumed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present observationally determined mass distributions of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in WR+OB binaries and black holes (BH) in spectroscopic binaries. Both WR and BH mass probability distributions can be well approximated by unbiased log-normal functions. Assuming that all WR stars with $M_\mathrm{WR}\gtrsim 6 M_\odot$ after core collapse are progenitors of the BHs, the similar shape of their mass distributions before and after collapse suggests a power-law relation between them $M_{\mathrm{BH}} \simeq (0.39\pm0.09) {M_{\mathrm{WR}}}^{1.13\pm0.09}$. Using the relation between masses of a WR star and its CO-core, we obtain the empirical relation between the BH mass and CO-core of the collapsing WR star $M_\mathrm{BH}\sim 0.9 M_\mathrm{CO}$, which can be used in the population synthesis calculations.

#### Fitting the Shadows: Star Formation Scaling Relations in the Low Surface Brightness Regime

 - **Abstract**
 Classical low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies pose an important challenge to galaxy evolution models. While they are found to host large reservoirs of atomic hydrogen, they display low stellar and star-formation surface densities. Global star formation scaling relations characterize trends in the star formation behaviour of galaxies; when used to compare populations or classes of galaxies, deviations in the observed trends can be used to probe predicted differences in physical conditions. In this work we utilize the well-studied Star Forming Main Sequence and integrated Kennicutt-Schmidt Relations to characterize star formation in the LSB regime, and compare the observed trends to relations for a normal star-forming galaxies. Using a comprehensive cross-matched sample of 277 LSB galaxies from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog Release 2 and the Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array Catalog, we gain an in-depth view of the star formation process in the LSB regime. HI-selected LSB galaxies follow very similar trends in atomic gas-to-stellar mass ratio and the star forming main sequence to their high surface brightness counterparts. However, while LSB galaxies host comparably large atomic gas reservoirs, they prove to be largely inefficient in converting this gas to stars with a median depletion time $t_{dep} \approx 18$ Gyr. These results are discussed in relation to previous studies which find that LSB galaxies host low atomic gas densities and are largely deficient in molecular gas, which suggest that the faint appearance of LSB galaxies may be the result of physical conditions on the sub-kpc scale.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. Ionized outflows in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are thought to influence the evolution of their host galaxies and super-massive black holes (SMBHs). Distance is important to understand the kinetic power of the outflows as a cosmic feedback channel. However, the distance of the outflows with respect to the central engine is poorly constrained. The density of the outflows is an essential parameter for estimating the distance of the outflows. NGC 5548 exhibits a variety of spectroscopic features in its archival spectra, which can be used for density analysis. Aims. We aim to use the variability of the absorption lines from the archival spectra to obtain a density constraint and then estimate the distance of the outflows. Methods. We used the archival observations of NGC 5548 taken with Chandra in January 2002 to search for variations of the absorption lines. Results. We found that the Mg XII Ly${\alpha}$ and the O VIII Ly${\beta}$ absorption lines have significant variation on the 144 ks time scale and the 162 ks time scale during the different observation periods. Based on the variability timescales and the physical properties of the variable components that dominated these two absorption lines, we derive a lower limit on the density of the variable warm absorber components in the range of $7.2-9.0{\times}10^{11} m^{-3}$, and an upper limit on their distance from the central source in the range of 0.2-0.5 pc.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) within the framework of $f(T,{L}_m)$ gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian is generalized as a function of the torsion scalar $T$ and the matter Lagrangian ${L}_m$. We analyze three representative $f(T,{L}_m)$ models and derive constraints on their free parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, by combining observational bounds from the freeze-out temperature with the primordial abundances of deuterium, helium-4, and lithium-7. For each model, the parameter space consistent with all elemental $Z$-constraints and the freeze-out condition is determined. These results demonstrate that $f(T,{L}_m)$ modifications can accommodate the tight observational constraints of BBN, suggesting that minimal extensions to the matter sector provide viable alternatives to the standard cosmological description and offer a promising framework for exploring modified gravity in the early Universe.

#### Cosmological Implications of a New Creation Field in Hoyle-Narlikar Gravity with Bulk Viscous Fluid

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we present a comprehensive investigation of the Narlikar gravity model with bulk viscous fluid by the new foam of creation field $C(t) = t + \int \alpha (1 - a)dt + c_1$, based on the Hoyle-Narlikar's creation-field theory, using a joint analysis of Observational Hubble Data (OHD) and the Pantheon supernova (PP) compilation. Our analysis reveals that the creation field coupling constant $(f)$ is always positive within the Narlikar gravity model from OHD+PP data sets. The best-fit estimates yield $ H_0 = 71.2 \pm 2.1 \text{km s}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\xi_0 = 0.23$, quoted at the $1 \sigma$ level. The Narlikar gravity model predicts a transition redshift of $z_t \approx 0.63$ marking the onset of late-time cosmic acceleration, with the corresponding age of the Universe estimated as $13.50\pm1.80 Gyr$. Interestingly, the inferred higher value of $H_0$, relative to SH0ES determinations, suggests a possible alleviation of the $\sim 4.1\sigma$ Hubble tension. Furthermore, we assess the stability of the model and demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be consistently explained through the energy conditions. This model retains dynamical flexibility while ensuring analytical tractability and provides a promising framework to investigate the cosmological implications of Hoyle-Narlikar gravity, particularly regarding late-time acceleration and the evolution of dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate gravitationally induced interference within the framework of teleparallel gravity, deriving a general expression for the gravitational phase difference and applying it to an EMS spacetime. We then analyze how this phase difference is affected by the presence or absence of black hole charge. Our results show that, irrespective of charge, the dominant contribution to the gravitational phase difference arises from the black hole mass. Nevertheless, while the influence of charge is negligible under standard astrophysical conditions, we identify a possible amplification mechanism through its interplay with the coupling parameter $\alpha$ in the case of extremal charged black holes. This finding not only offers new theoretical insights but also suggests experimental opportunities for probing charged black hole parameters via quantum interferometric techniques.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present two generalized formulations of the Holographic and Ricci dark energy (DE) models, given by $ \rho_{GH} = 3c^2M^{2}_{pl} \left[ 1-\epsilon\left(1-\frac{R}{H^2}\right) \right]H^2$ and $\rho_{GR} = 3c^2M^{2}_{pl}\left[ 1-\eta\left(1-\frac{H^2}{R}\right) \right]R$ where $H$ and $R$ denote the Hubble parameter and the Ricci scalar, while $\epsilon$ and $\eta$ are model parameters related by $\epsilon = 1 - \eta$. We derived explicit analytical expressions for key cosmological quantities, including the Hubble parameter, the DE density $\rho_D$, the DE pressure $p_D$, the equation of state parameter of DE $\omega_D$ and the deceleration parameter $q$. The analysis was carried out for four distinct cases: (i) the standard model in its original formulation; (ii) the inclusion of spatial curvature; (iii) the addition of interactions between the dark sectors; and (iv) the presence of both interaction and curvature. Moreover, we also considered the limiting case of a DE Dominated Universe. To further characterize the dynamical features of the models, we investigated several diagnostic tools, namely the Statefinder parameters, the cosmographic approach, the $Om(z)$ diagnostic and the squared speed of the sound $v_s^2$ to assess stability against perturbations. Moreover, we established a correspondence between the DE models we studied and some scalar field theories, including tachyon, k-essence, dilaton, quintessence, Dirac-Born-Infeld, Yang-Mills and Nonlinear Electrodynamics (NLED) fields.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the extraction of rotational energy from rotating Einstein-Born-Infeld (EBI) black holes, where nonlinear electrodynamics introduces a radius-dependent effective charge modifying the spacetime geometry. Focusing on neutral test particles in the equatorial plane, we derive analytic expressions for their kinematics and establish conditions for negative energy orbits essential to the Penrose process using the near-horizon limit and Wald inequality. We present a closed-form expression for maximal energy extraction efficiency as a function of spin, charge, and the Born-Infeld parameter $\beta$. Our numerical survey reveals that increasing charge and nonlinear Born-Infeld effects generally reduce horizon radius and ergoregion size, suppressing energy extraction efficiency compared to Kerr and often Kerr-Newman black holes. However, at certain spins and \$beta$, the EBI geometry can enhance efficiency beyond Kerr-Newman. We also compute the irreducible mass, showing how nonlinear electromagnetic dynamics reduce the horizon area and the associated entropy proxy. These results provide a unified picture linking nonlinear electrodynamics, horizon structure, and energy extraction efficiency across relevant parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 In principle, rapidly rotating black holes (BHs) with accretion disks -- either prograde or retrograde -- could naturally act as high-energy particle colliders (HEPCs) because particles falling in from infinity that collide with particles in the disk near the BH horizon can exhibit center-of-mass (CM) energies beyond the capabilities of terrestrial instruments. However, we show that scattering can moderate the CM energy of near-horizon collisions. We find that rapidly rotating BHs with prograde accretion disks are the most viable candidates for astrophysical HEPCs, whereas BHs with retrograde disks are disfavored, when scattering is incorporated.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the use of the Gegenbauer procedure for time-domain reconstruction in frequency-domain calculations of the self-force on a particle orbiting a black hole. The conventional technique relies on the so-called method of extended homogeneous solutions (EHS), which circumvents the Gibbs phenomenon that would otherwise hamper the reconstruction of the particle's field from frequency modes. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of EHS reconstruction deteriorates rapidly with increasing orbital eccentricity, due to large numerical cancellations between frequency-mode contributions. Furthermore, the method is only suitable for bound orbits and cannot be fully applied in scattering scenarios. The Gegenbauer reconstruction procedure involves a re-projection of the partial Fourier representation onto a complementary basis of polynomials. The resulting series converges exponentially while averting the cancellation problem. We demonstrate the procedure with numerical results for the spherical harmonic modes of the scalar field sourced by a scalar charge in orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. We illustrate the merits of this approach, and discuss the challenges that remain for a full Gegenbauer-based self-force calculation.

 - **Abstract**
 We uncover a new class of phenomena in gravitational physics, whereby resonances in the complex plane can be excited via tailored time-dependent scattering. We show that specific forms of temporal modulation of an incoming signal can lead to complete absorption for the entire duration of the scattering process. This, then, makes stars and black holes truly black. Such ``virtual absorption'' stores energy with high efficiency, releasing it once the process finishes via relaxation into the characteristic virtual absorption modes -- also known as total transmission modes -- of the object. While such modes are challenging to obtain and four-dimensional black holes have a restricted set of solutions, we also show that higher dimensional black holes have a complex and interesting structure of virtual absorption modes.

 - **Abstract**
 As part of our program to develop a general theory of relativity for open systems, we introduce a covariant theory that incorporates the effects of classical and quantum spacetime alterations in a new metric tensor that effectively includes these alterations, thereby generating a Riemannian manifold from a new varied action without boundary terms. We illustrate the theory by studying an inflationary model which incorporates the quantum feedback effects of spacetime on the dynamics of the inflaton field $\hat{\varphi}$, enabling the simultaneous quantization of $\hat{\varphi}$ and the fluctuating gravitational field $\hat{\Omega}$ without relying on perturbative theory. We obtain an exact solution for the modes of both fields, $\hat{\varphi}$ and $\hat{\Omega}$, which comply with different quantum algebras. The normalization of the inflaton field modes that is obtained is intrinsically related to the geometric field modes, in such a way that the quantization of the fields results from an expression that links the geometric fields with the physical fields. Finally, the quadratic fluctuations of spacetime are calculated, and its spectrum is analyzed.

#### Modeling Gravastar Structure admitting Kuchowicz Spacetime in Rastall Gravity Theory

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the gravastar model as a potential alternative to black holes, utilizing the Kuchowicz metric in the context of Rastall gravity. The model comprises three distinct regions: an interior with positive energy density and negative pressure, a thin intermediate shell made of ultra-relativistic stiff fluid, and an exterior vacuum. The negative pressure within the interior generates an outward force exerted on the shell, fulfilling the Zel'dovich criterion. This configuration eliminates the central singularity and replaces the event horizon with the shell. We then derive the radial metric functions for both the inner and thin region, yielding a non-singular solution. Furthermore, we examine the physical properties of the shell, such as its energy, proper length, entropy, equation of state parameter, gravitational redshift and adiabatic index, across a range of Rastall parameter values. We conclude that the resulting gravastar model offers a promising solution to the singularity problem of conventional black holes within the context of this non-conservative theory.

 - **Abstract**
 General relativity describes the dynamics of gravitational waves, which can feature nonlinear interactions, such as those underlying turbulent processes. Theoretical and numerical explorations have demonstrated the existence of gravitational wave turbulence, of which a full and general mathematical description is currently not known. Here, we take essential steps towards such a theory. Leveraging a formulation exactly recasting general relativity as a set of nonlinear electrodynamics equations, we demonstrate that general relativity admits an Elsasser formulation -- the same type of equation underpinning magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We further show that nonlinear interactions described by this equation are in part Alfvénic, linking gravitational wave turbulence to Alfvénic turbulence. Our work paves the way for a new understanding of nonlinear gravitational wave dynamics through insights from magnetohydrodynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate static spherically symmetric solutions within the framework of the local limit of nonlocal gravity. This theory departs from Einstein's general relativity (GR) through the introduction of a scalar gravitational susceptibility function $S(x)$, $1+S > 0$, which is a new feature of the spacetime that vanishes in the GR limit. It is shown that the Schwarzschild spacetime constitutes an exact solution of the modified source-free gravitational field equations provided $S$ is a constant. The mass of the corresponding Schwarzschild solution is given by $M/(1+S)$, where $M$ denotes the mass of the solution in the GR limit. The interpretation of the solution in terms of a black hole is ruled out due to the divergence of the algebraic invariants of the Weitzenböck torsion at the Schwarzschild horizon.

#### Polarimetry imprints of exotic compact objects: relativistic fluid spheres and gravastars

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of polarimetric parameters of active galactic nuclei motivate the study of polarization in the spacetime of exotic compact objects which can mimic the features of black holes in the strong field regime of gravity. In this work, we study the properties of two models for ultra-compact objects containing light rings - relativistic fluid spheres and gravastars. We have simulated the orbit of a hot spot around the considered objects in the polarization ray-tracing software GYOTO, and extracted observables, namely integrated images of the Stokes parameters I, Q, U; their evolution during the orbit in the QU-plane, and the electric vector position angle (EVPA). Our models resemble the black hole qualitatively, with slight additional imprints which provide a useful tool to constrain the spacetime metric of supermassive compact objects with current and future observations, and probe the fundamental properties of these objects. We have found that one fluid star model with a pressure singularity resembles the black hole entirely, while another gravastar features notable differences in the EVPA curve in the low-inclination case. Since differences between the models become more pronounced for a higher inclination, our results could potentially restrict the adequateness of ECO classes with future high-inclination observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce the notion of Stäckel lift as a novel geometric setting for the construction of large classes of integrable Hamiltonian systems. The Stäckel lift extends the geometric framework underlying both the Riemannian and the Lorentzian-type classical Eisenhart lifts and is intimately related with Haantjes geometry. In particular, we establish that Hamiltonian systems constructed through Stäckel lifts are naturally endowed with a symplectic-Haantjes structure. We also show that explicitly momentum-dependent lifting matrices produce systems interpretable as gravitational waves, or momentum-dependent metrics of Hamilton and Finsler geometries, with potential applications in modified gravity theories.

#### Chronology Protection of Rotating Black Holes in a Viable Lorentz-Violating Gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We study causal properties of the recently found rotating black-hole solution in the low-energy sector of Horava gravity as a viable Lorentz-violating (LV) gravity in four dimensions with the LV Maxwell field and a cosmological constant $\Lambda (>-3/a^2)$ for an arbitrary rotation parameter $a$. The region of non-trivial causality violation containing closed timelike curves is exactly the same as in the Kerr-Newman or the Kerr-Newman-(Anti-)de Sitter solution. Nevertheless, chronology is protected in the new rotating black hole because the causality violating region becomes physically inaccessible by exterior observers due to the new three-curvature singularity at its boundary that is topologically two-torus including the usual ring singularity at $(r,\theta)=(0,\pi/2)$. As a consequence, the physically accessible region outside the torus singularity is causal everywhere.
