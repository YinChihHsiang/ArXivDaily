#### Mapping the Stellar Kinematics in the Central 240 Parsecs of M87 with the James Webb Space Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 The supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the giant elliptical galaxy M87 is one of the most well-studied in the local universe, but the stellar- and gas-dynamical SMBH mass measurements disagree. As this galaxy is a key anchor for the upper end of the SMBH mass$-$host galaxy relations, we revisit the central $3''\times 3''$ ($\sim 240\times240$ pc) region of M87 with the Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) integral field unit (IFU) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We implement several improvements to the reduction pipeline and obtain high signal-to-noise spectra ($S/N \sim 150$) in single $0.''05 $ spaxels across much of the NIRSpec field of view. We measure the detailed shape of the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution, parameterized by Gauss-Hermite moments up to $h_8$, in $\sim 2800$ spatial bins, substantially improving upon the prior high angular resolution studies of the M87 stellar kinematics. The NIRSpec data reveal velocities with $V \sim \pm 45$ km s$^{-1}$, velocity dispersions that rise sharply to $\sim$$420$ km s$^{-1}$ at a projected radius of 0.$''$45 (36 pc), and a slight elevation in $h_4$ toward the nucleus. We comprehensively test the robustness of the kinematics, including using multiple velocity template libraries and adopting different polynomials to adjust the template spectra. We find that the NIRSpec stellar kinematics seamlessly transition to recently measured large-scale stellar kinematics from optical Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) IFU data. These combined NIRSpec and KCWI kinematics provide continuous coverage from parsec to kiloparsec scales and will critically constrain future stellar-dynamical models of M87.

 - **Abstract**
 We present results from uGMRT 685 MHz observations of 87 QSOs belonging to the Palomar Green (PG) quasar sample with $z<0.5$. Radio emission is detected in all sources except for 3 radio-quiet (RQ) sources, viz., PG 0043+039, PG 1121+422, and PG 1552+085. The radio-loud (RL) $-$ RQ dichotomy persists at 685 MHz with only 1 source, PG 1216+069, changing its classification from RQ to RL. Approximately 1/3 of the detected RQ quasars display AGN-dominated radio emission while the rest may show additional contributions from stellar-related processes. Consistent with this, the RL and RQ quasars occupy distinct tracks on the `fundamental plane' of black hole activity. We find that RL quasars have $\log_{10}(L_{685\,\mathrm{MHz}}/\mathrm{W\,Hz}^{-1}) > 25.5$, while RQ quasars have ${\log_{10}(L_{685\,\mathrm{MHz}}/\mathrm{W\,Hz}^{-1})} <23.5$. Furthermore, the radio sizes display the RQ$-$RL divide as well with RQ sources typically having sizes $\lesssim30$ kpc, with only 16 ($\sim22$%) RQ sources having sizes between 30 and 100 kpc where there is an overlap with RL quasar sizes. A strong correlation exists between 685 MHz radio luminosity and black hole mass which is tightened when accretion rate is considered, highlighting the important role played by the accretion rate and accretion disk structure in jet production. We found no difference in the minimum-energy magnetic field strengths of the radio cores of RL and RQ quasars; however, different assumptions of source volume and volume filling factors may apply. High-resolution X-ray observations and radio-X-ray flux comparisons are needed to independently test the `magnetic flux paradigm'.

#### A $z\simeq0.4$ Little Red Dot analog: An Extended Starburst with an Overmassive Black hole

 - **Abstract**
 One of the most remarkable discoveries of JWST is a population of compact, red sources at z > 4, commonly referred to as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Spectroscopic identifications reported that most LRDs are active galactic nuclei (AGNs), which are preferentially found around z~6 and could imply a key phase in the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) in the early universe. Photometric surveys at lower redshift have recently been carried out to trace their evolution across cosmic time, and a small number of LRDs have been spectroscopically identified at both Cosmic Noon and in the local universe. Here we report the discovery of one of the lowest-z analogs of LRDs, J204837.26-002437.2 (hereafter J2048) at z = 0.4332, using new Gemini-N/GMOS IFU observations combined with archival multi-band photometric SED data. The GMOS data reveal extended blue emission from starburst with a star formation rate of 400 Msun yr-1, together with an extended, highly fast ionized outflow. This is the first spectroscopic confirmation of extended host emission and outflow in an LRD-like galaxy, providing a unique laboratory for understanding the nature of their high-redshift counterparts. Moreover, J2048 would host an extremely overmassive BH with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio of 0.6, with the BH mass and host stellar mass estimated to be 10^10.2 and 10^10.4 Msun, respectively. We discuss the origin and evolutionary fate of J2048, and the implications that such low-z analogs have for interpreting the properties of high-z LRDs.

 - **Abstract**
 In the last few years, a few supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have shown short-term (of the order of hours) X-ray variability. Given the limited size of the sample, every new addition to this class of SMBHs can bring invaluable information. Within the context of an automated search for X-ray sources showing flux variability in the \textit{Chandra} archive, we identified peculiar variability patterns in 2MASX J12571076+2724177 (J1257), a SMBH in the Coma cluster, during observations performed in 2020. We investigated the long-term evolution of the flux, together with the evolution of the spectral parameters throughout the \textit{Chandra} and \textit{XMM-Newton} observations, which cover a time span of approximately 20 years. We found that J1257 has repeatedly shown peculiar variability over the last 20 years, on typical timescales of $\simeq20-25$ ks. From our spectral analysis, we found hints of a softer-when-brighter behaviour and of two well-separated flux states. We suggest that J1257 might represent a new addition to the ever-growing size of relatively low mass SMBHs ($M\simeq10^6-10^7\mathrm{M}_\odot$) showing extreme, possibly quasi-periodic X-ray variability on short time scales. The available dataset does not allow for a definitive classification of the nature of the variability. However, given the observed properties, it could either represent a quasi-periodic oscillation at particularly low frequency or be associated with quasi-periodic eruptions in an AGN with peculiar spectral properties.

 - **Abstract**
 We re-investigated the distance to the black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-47 by analyzing its dust scattering halo (DSH) using high-resolution X-ray (Chandra) and millimeter (APEX) observations. Dust scattering halos form when X-rays from a compact source are scattered by interstellar dust, creating diffuse ring-like structures that can provide clues about the source's distance. Our previous work suggested two possible distances: 4.9 kpc and 11.5 kpc, but uncertainties remained due to low-resolution CO maps. We developed a new methodology to refine these estimates, starting with a machine learning approach to determine a 3D representation of molecular clouds from the APEX dataset. The 3D maps are combined with X-ray flux measurements to generate synthetic DSH images. By comparing synthetic images with the observed Chandra data through radial and azimuthal profile fitting, we not only measure the source distance but also distinguish whether the molecular clouds are at their near or far distances. The current analysis again supported a distance of 11.5 kpc over alternative estimates. While the method produced a lower reduced chi-squared for both the azimuthal and radial fits for a distance of 13.6 kpc, we ruled it out as it would have produced a bright ring beyond the APEX field of view, which is not seen in the Chandra image. The 4.85 kpc estimate was also excluded due to poor fit quality and cloud distance conflicts. The systematic error of 1 kpc, arising from uncertainties in determining molecular cloud distances, dominates the total error.

#### Rapid onset of a Comptonisation zone in the repeating tidal disruption event XMMSL2 J140446.9-251135

 - **Abstract**
 We report here on observations of a tidal disruption event, XMMSL2 J1404-2511, discovered in an XMM-Newton slew, in a quiescent galaxy at z=0.043. X-ray monitoring covered the epoch when the accretion disc transitioned from a thermal state, with kT~80 eV, to a harder state dominated by a warm, optically-thick corona. The bulk of the coronal formation took place within 7 days and was coincident with a temporary drop in the emitted radiation by a factor 4. After a plateau phase of ~100 days, the X-ray flux of XMMSL2 J1404-2511 decayed by a factor 500 within 230 days. We estimate the black hole mass in the galaxy to be $M_{BH}=4\pm{2}\times10^{6}$ solar masses and the peak X-ray luminosity $L_{X}\sim6\times10^{43}$ ergs/s. The optical/UV light curve is flat over the timescale of the observations with $L_{opt}\sim 2\times10^{41}$ ergs/s. We find that TDEs with coronae are more often found in an X-ray sample than in an optically-selected sample. Late-time monitoring of the optical sample is needed to test whether this is an intrinsic property of TDEs or is due to a selection effect. From the fast decay of the X-ray emission we consider that the event was likely due to the partial stripping of an evolved star rather than a full stellar disruption, an idea supported by the detection of two further re-brightening episodes, two and four years after the first event, in the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey.

 - **Abstract**
 Context. A dual active galactic nucleus candidate with a separation of only 500 pc was recently found in NGC 7727. According to the hierarchical merging scenario, such objects would be expected to merge on a timescale of a few hundred Myr. However, estimating the accurate merging timescales for the two nuclei is still a complex challenge. Aims. Using our numerical N-body code, we can trace the full evolution of central black holes during all phases: dynamical friction of unbound black holes, binary black hole formation, hardening of the system due to two-body scattering, and emission of gravitational waves leading to the final merger. Methods. Our model has next components: the bulge contains two dense stellar nuclei, each of which hosts a black hole. The most massive black hole in the center of the galaxy has a mass of 1.54x10^8 Msol and the least massive black hole in the offset second stripped nucleus has a mass of 6.33x10^6 Msol. We followed the dynamical evolution of the system up to a final separation of four Schwarzschild radii. The black holes were added as special relativistic particles and their equation of motion contains a full post-Newtonian approximation - 2.5 term. Results. Initially, the black holes are not gravitationally bound and, thus, the system spends more than 60 Myr in the phase of dynamical friction while tightening the orbit. The two-body scattering phase takes place from 60 Myr up to 120 Myr. In the last 10 Myr, the black hole's separation is seen to be rapidly shrinking due to the gravitational wave emission. Starting from the physical separation observed today, the total merging time in our model is 130 (10) Myr. Conclusions. These results have implications for the statistics of strong sources of gravitational waves at low frequencies, namely, systems engaged in an advanced state of are expected to be prime sources for the LISA mission to observe.

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), with masses ranging from a hundred and a million solar masses, are hypothesised to be surrounded by dense regions of dark matter known as dark matter spikes, where the annihilation of dark matter particles could produce detectable gamma rays. The detection of dark matter annihilation around IMBHs therefore offers a promising approach for probing the nature of dark matter. In this work, we search for dark matter annihilation around IMBHs using data from the Galactic Plane Survey, the Extragalactic Survey and a selection of satellite galaxies observed by the H.E.S.S. gamma-ray experiment in Namibia. Since no evidence for a gamma-ray signal from dark matter annihilation around IMBHs has been found, we set upper limits on the velocity-weighted annihilation cross section for dark matter masses between 800 GeV and 100 TeV. Our analysis obtains limits on the velocity-weighted annihilation cross section below the thermal relic cross section for dark matter masses between 10 and 100 TeV.

 - **Abstract**
 This article is a status report on the Anholonomic Frame and Connection Deformation Method, AFCDM, for constructing generic off-diagonal exact and parametric solutions in general relativity, GR, relativistic geometric flows, and modified gravity theories, MGTs. Such models can be generalized to nonassociative and noncommutative star products on phase spaces and modelled equivalently as nonassociative Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton geometries. Our approach involves a nonholonomic geometric reformulation of classical models of gravitational and matter fields described by Lagrange and Hamilton densities on relativistic phase spaces. Using nonholonomic dyadic variables, the Einstein equations in GR and MGTs can be formulated as systems of nonlinear partial differential equations(PDEs), which can be decoupled and integrated in some general off-diagonal forms. In this approach, the Lagrange and Hamilton dynamics and related models of classical and quantum evolution are equivalently described in terms of generalized Finsler-like or canonical metrics and (nonlinear) connection structures on deformed phase spaces defined by solutions of modified Einstein equations. New classes of exact and parametric solutions in (nonassociative) MGTs are formulated in terms of generating and integration functions and generating effective/ matter sources. The physical interpretation of respective classes of solutions depends on the type of (non) linear symmetries, prescribed boundary/ asymptotic conditions, or posed Cauchy problems.

#### Study of Kiselev Black Hole in Quantum Fluctuation Modified Gravity via Quasinormal modes and Greybody Factors

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we formulate the wave function to compute the effective potential of scalar and vector fields for the Kiselve black hole in the background of quantum fluctuation modified gravity. Using the 6th-order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approach, the quasinormal modes for the considered black hole are obtained through scalar and vector perturbation fields. We investigate the quasinormal frequency by considering several values of the metric and equation of state ($\mho$ and $\bar{\bar{\omega}}$) parameter, respectively. The real part values of the quasinormal modes drop as the $\mho$ values rise. Later, the greybody factors of the black hole are determined and found that the parameters $\mho$, $\bar{\bar{\omega}}$ and the multipole moment $l$ significantly affects the greybody factors. Additionally, for scalar perturbations, we graphically analyze the rigorous bound of the greybody factor under the effects of parameters $\mho$ and $l$.

 - **Abstract**
 We compute relativistic Lindblad torques for circular, equatorial extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) embedded in relativistic thin accretion discs, including spinning black hole configurations. We find that relativistic effects can amplify the magnitude of these torques by orders of magnitude in the strong-field regime, and that the torque can even reverse direction as the EMRI approaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). However, we show that the location of this reversal is highly spin-dependent, shifting progressively closer to the ISCO, where gravitational-wave emission completely dominates the inspiral, as the spin of the central black hole increases. Spin also modifies the radial dependence of the Lindblad torques. We investigate whether Lindblad torques can be approximated by parametrised power laws of the form T_LR = A(r_s / 10M)^n_r (or combinations thereof), and find significant spin- and disc-dependent variations in the slope parameter n_r. For instance, for spin a/M = 0.9, we find n_r = 3.6 in the strong-field regime, compared to the Newtonian value of n_r = 4.5. Given current forecasts of parameter recovery for ``golden'', loud EMRIs in accretion discs (\Delta n_r ~ 0.5), we predict LISA could distinguish between different disc configurations through their relativistic Lindblad torque signatures, providing the first direct probe of the midplane structure of the inner region of accretion discs, which is inaccessible to electromagnetic observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Two-dimensional dilaton gravity provides a valuable framework to study the dynamics of quantum black holes. These models are often coupled to conformal scalar fields, which capture essential quantum effects such as the trace anomaly, while remaining analytically tractable. From the viewpoint of two-dimensional quantum field theory, unitary theories require a positive central charge. However, theories with a total negative central charge naturally arise from the contribution of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts to the effective action. Recent analyses of the Callan-Giddins-Harvey-Strominger (CGHS) model with a Russo-Susskin-Thorlacius (RST) counterterm have shown that a negative central charge can remove curvature singularities in the backreacted geometry. In this work, we argue that singularity resolution arises from the negative central charge itself, rather than the particular dynamics of a given model. To support this, we present analogous results in spherically reduced Einstein gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 This thesis investigates the characteristics of modified teleparallel gravity models that incorporate a scalar field and a trace of the energy-momentum tensor, with particular attention to their cosmological effects, especially regarding late-time cosmic acceleration. Teleparallel gravity, as an alternative framework to General Relativity, defines gravity through torsion rather than curvature, and when combined with a scalar field, it allows exploration of a wider variety of cosmological scenarios. This thesis examines the late-time acceleration of the Universe and its various phases through dynamical system analysis within the framework of modified teleparallel gravity theories. It presents the mathematical formulations of $f(T)$, $f(T, \mathcal{T})$, $f(T, \phi)$, Horndeski teleparallel gravity, and the quintessence dark energy model, along with the application of dynamical systems and relevant cosmological datasets. Overall, the results demonstrate that these modified teleparallel gravity models provide viable descriptions of the late-time cosmic acceleration and offer insights into the dynamics of the Universe beyond standard cosmology.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binaries are excellent probes of gravity in the strong- and dynamical-field regime. We report a test of general relativity (GR) with the third GW Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) using the recently developed neural post-Einsteinian framework, both on individual events and at the population level through hierarchical modeling. We find no significant violation of GR and place a constraint that, for the first time, efficiently covers non-GR theories characterized by not only post-Newtonian deviations but also those beyond under the same theory-agnostic framework.

 - **Abstract**
 Weakly-modelled searches for gravitational waves are essential for ensuring that all potential sources are accounted for in detection efforts, as they make minimal assumptions regarding source morphology. While these searches primarily target generic transient sources, they are also highly effective at identifying a broad range of compact binary coalescences, demonstrated by the weakly-modelled search algorithm coherent WaveBurst being the first to detect GW150914. Despite their ability to detect compact binaries with diverse properties, the accurate estimation of source parameters from their output remains to be a challenging task. To overcome this, we leverage physics-informed neural networks, which serve as a powerful tool for parameter estimation by applying physical constraints through the universal differential equation governing a compact binary system. With this approach, we rapidly infer the mass parameters of binary black hole merger systems to within 7% from only the time-frequency representation of the gravitational wave signal.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations of compact binary systems have provided evidence for black holes with masses below standard expectations. When paired with neutron stars (NSs), such low-mass black holes (BHs) have the potential to be detected by future multimessenger campaigns and could unveil unknown features of the BH population in the universe. Given the importance of accurate models for matched-filtering searches and Bayesian parameter estimation in discoveries of this sort, attention has renewed on the limitations of low-mass NSBH merger models and on the downstream impact of such limitations on gravitational-wave data analysis. Previous numerical relativity (NR) studies have revealed discrepancies in the predicted merger time, as well as more general mismatches and dephasing between phenomenological models and high-resolution simulations. The simulation presented here was motivated by these findings and illustrates how publicly available tools can be applied to this specific science case, towards informing next-generation, more refined gravitational-wave and kilonovae models. Here, we summarize the setup of a high-resolution general relativistic hydrodynamics simulation of an equal-mass NSBH system performed entirely with public codes (Einstein Toolkit and FUKA) and a finite-temperature equation of state. The results we show include the $(\ell,m)=(2,2)$ strain and 2D snapshots of the system undergoing tidal disruption and early postmerger disk formation. The system evolved for $\sim 4$ orbits while the $L_2$ norm of the Hamiltonian constraint remained below $6\times10^{-7}$ throughout the inspiral prior to growing near merger time.

 - **Abstract**
 We show that the structure of the Lorentz group in four dimensions is such that unimodular (trace-free) gravity in electrovacuum can be consistently represented as an algebraic condition on the symmetric product space of 2-forms. This condition states that the commutator between the Riemann tensor and the Hodge dual must be equal to the commutator between Hodge dual and an operator constructed from the Maxwell tensor; symbolically, $[\text{Riem}, \star] = [\star, F \boxtimes F]$. We show that this condition is equivalent to the trace-free field equations, that the right-hand-side vanishes if and only if the energy-momentum tensor vanishes (recovering the appropriate Einstein spacetime limit) and that this condition can be solved in the spherically symmetric ansatz to yield Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter uniquely. This analysis suggests that the conceptual distinction between unimodular gravity and General Relativity is one of emphasis on how irreducible representations of the Riemann tensor are constrained by the existence of energy-momentum and the associated field equations.

 - **Abstract**
 We extend the semiclassical black hole microstate construction to include quantum corrections to the microscopic entropy using a doubly holographic model of black holes. Specifically, we consider a double-sided black hole on a JT brane with holographic matter, coupled to a pair of holographic CFTs on the asymptotic boundaries. The dimension of the Hilbert space spanned by the microstates of this doubly holographic black hole is given by the exponentiated entropy, which is equal to the sum of the quantum-corrected thermodynamic entropies of the left and right black holes. Importantly, the quantum-corrected thermodynamic entropy is shown to be equal to the generalised entropy of the eternal black hole, and thus can be interpreted as quantifying the entanglement between the two asymptotic boundaries.
