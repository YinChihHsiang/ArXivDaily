 - **Abstract**
 The black-hole occupation fraction ($f_\mathrm{occ}$) defines the fraction of galaxies that harbor central massive black holes (MBHs), irrespective of their accretion activity level. While it is widely accepted that $f_\mathrm{occ}$ is nearly 100% in local massive galaxies with stellar masses $M_\star \gtrsim 10^{10}~M_\odot$, it is not yet clear whether MBHs are ubiquitous in less-massive galaxies. In this work, we present new constraints on $f_\mathrm{occ}$ based on over 20 years of Chandra imaging data for 1606 galaxies within 50 Mpc. We employ a Bayesian model to simultaneously constrain $f_\mathrm{occ}$ and the specific accretion-rate distribution function, $p(\lambda)$, where the specific accretion rate is defined as $\lambda=L_\mathrm{X}/M_\star$, and $L_\mathrm{X}$ is the MBH accretion luminosity in the 2-10 keV range. Notably, we find that $p(\lambda)$ peaks around $10^{28}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}~M_\odot^{-1}$; above this value, $p(\lambda)$ decreases with increasing $\lambda$, following a power-law that smoothly connects with the probability distribution of bona-fide active galactic nuclei. We also find that the occupation fraction decreases dramatically with decreasing $M_\star$: in high mass galaxies ($M_\star \approx 10^{11-12}M_\odot$), the occupation fraction is $>93\%$ (a $2\sigma$ lower limit), and then declines to $66_{-7}^{+8}\%$ ($1\sigma$ errors) between $M_\star\approx10^{9-10}M_\odot$, and to $33_{-9}^{+13}\%$ in the dwarf galaxy regime between $M_\star\approx10^{8-9}~M_\odot$. Our results have significant implications for the normalization of the MBH mass function over the mass range most relevant for tidal disruption events, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and MBH merger rates that upcoming facilities are poised to explore.

 - **Abstract**
 Gamma-ray bursts are flashes of high-energy radiation lasting from a fraction of a second to several hours. Military satellites made the first detections of GRBs in the late 1960s. The $\gamma$-ray emission forms from shocks in a relativistic jet launched from a compact central engine. In addition to the emission of $\gamma$-rays, the interaction of the jet with the surrounding medium yields afterglow emission that can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum. Redshift measurements from these afterglows place GRBs from the local to the distant Universe. The central engines of GRBs are thought to be either a hyperaccreting black hole or a highly magnetized neutron star (magnetar). There is now strong observational evidence that this central engine is created either in the core collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star or via the merger of two compact objects (neutron stars or a neutron star with a black hole). The combination of stellar scale events with extreme energies and luminosities makes GRBs powerful probes of the extreme physics involved in their production and of other areas of astrophysics and cosmology. These include as the electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources, the production and acceleration of relativistic jets, the synthesis of heavy elements, the study of the interstellar and intergalactic medium, and the identification of the collapse of early generations of stars.

 - **Abstract**
 We present VLT/X-shooter spectroscopy of the extremely metal-poor starburst galaxy SBS 0335-052E, a nearby (D $\sim$54 Mpc) analog of high-redshift systems, probing its outflow up to a distance of $\sim$2.6 kpc. Using direct-method oxygen abundances, we find a complex metallicity profile that generally declines with distance, decreasing by 0.37 dex from the galaxy center out to 2.4 kpc into the outflow. This implies a metal-loading factor roughly an order of magnitude lower than predictions based on the mass-metallicity relation for low-mass galaxies. We also detect extended HeII emission, including a broad, redshifted component beyond 2 kpc, distinct from narrow emission associated with star clusters. No H$\beta$ emission is detected associated with the broad redshifted component, implying extremely high HeII/H$\beta$ ratios (0.7--4.8). Such extreme values, combined with the decreasing metallicity, challenge current models for stellar feedback. The contribution of an intermediate-mass black hole could simultaneously account for the declining metallicity and the unusually extended HeII emission.

#### Validation of the DESI-DR1 3x2-pt analysis: scale cut and shear ratio tests

 - **Abstract**
 Combined survey analyses of galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing (3x2-pt studies) will allow new and accurate tests of the standard cosmological model. However, careful validation is necessary to ensure that these cosmological constraints are not biased by uncertainties associated with the modelling of astrophysical or systematic effects. In this study we validate the combined 3x2-pt analysis of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI-DR1) spectroscopic galaxy clustering and overlapping weak lensing datasets from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and the Hyper-Suprime-Cam Survey (HSC). By propagating the modelling uncertainties associated with the non-linear matter power spectrum, non-linear galaxy bias and baryon feedback, we design scale cuts to ensure that measurements of the matter density and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum are biased by less than 30% of the statistical error. We also test the internal consistency of the data and weak lensing systematics by performing new measurements of the lensing shear ratio. We demonstrate that the DESI-DR1 shear ratios can be successfully fit by the same model used to describe cosmic shear correlations, and analyse the additional information that can be extracted about the source redshift distributions and intrinsic alignment parameters. This study serves as crucial preparation for the upcoming cosmological parameter analysis of these datasets.

#### Gaussian process analysis of type-B quasiperiodic oscillations in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630

 - **Abstract**
 We analyzed Insight-HXMT data of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630 during the type-B QPO phase of its 2019 outburst. Using the Gaussian process method, we applied an additive composite kernel model consisting of an SHO, a DRW, and an additional white noise (AWN) to data from three energy bands: LE (1-10 keV), ME (10-30 keV), and HE (30-150 keV). We find that for the DRW component, correlations on the timescale of $\tau_{\rm DRW}\sim10$ s are absent in the LE band, while they persist in the ME and HE bands over the full duration of the light curves. This energy-dependent behavior may reflect thermal instabilities, with the shorter correlation timescale in the disk compared to the corona. Alternatively, it may reflect variable Comptonizations of seed photons from different disk regions. Inner-disk photons are scattered by a small inner corona, producing soft X-rays. Outer-disk photons interact with an extended, jet-like corona, resulting in harder emission. The QPO is captured by an SHO component with a stable period of $\sim 0.2$ s and a high quality factor of $\sim 10$. The absence of significant evolution with energy or time of the SHO component suggests a connection between the accretion disk and the corona, which may be built by coherent oscillations of disk-corona driven by magnetorotational instability. The AWN components are present in all the three-band data and dominate over the DRW and SHO components. We interpret the AWN as another fast DRW with its $\tau_{\rm DRW} < 0.01$ s. It may trace high-frequency fluctuations that occur in both the inner region of the accretion disk and the corona. Overall, our work reveals a timescale hierarchy in the coupled disk-corona scenario: fast DRW < SHO < disk DRW < corona DRW.

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123 is a binary black hole merger whose primary component lies within or above the pair-instability mass gap, while the secondary component falls within this gap. The standard theory of stellar evolution is significantly challenged by this event. We investigate the formation of candidate progenitors of GW231123 in Population III (Pop3) star clusters. We find that they could form through stellar mergers, binary black hole mergers, and mixed mergers. The mass distribution of these candidate progenitors covers the component masses of GW231123. Their predicted merger rate density spans the range of $0.001{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}-0.26{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$, encompassing that of GW231123. These findings suggest that GW231123 may originate from Pop3 star clusters. Furthermore, such candidate progenitors are expected to be detectable by future gravitational wave detectors LISA/Taiji/TianQin/DECIGO/CE/ET, which would provide valuable insights into the formation scenarios of events like GW231123.

 - **Abstract**
 Accretion rates in radio galaxies are typically estimated from optical and total radio flux measurements, incorporating emission from the core, jets, and lobes. These estimates can be used to investigate the link between observed Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) emission properties and the underlying accretion physics of their Super-Massive Black Holes (SMBHs). However, while optical and core radio emission trace the ongoing accretion episode, extended jet and lobe structures may result from past AGN activity. Therefore, accretion rates inferred from spatially unresolved radio observations may be systematically overestimated, a bias whose prevalence and extent have yet to be thoroughly explored. In this study, using a sample of 121 local radio-loud galaxies with spatially resolved radio components, we assess this effect by estimating their \textit{Eddington}-scaled accretion rates ($\lambda$) using both the common methodology which considers total radio fluxes and a simple but novel approach that treats core and extended emission as signatures of distinct accretion phases. Our results show that the former method systematically overestimates the $\lambda$ by a factor of $\sim 3$, affecting the accretion mode classification in approximately $11\%$ of sources. This discrepancy appears to correlate with radio size, with the most extended galaxies indicating a transition in accretion disk mode. Such a bias could affect AGN classification in unresolved high-redshift radio surveys. Our results motivate re-examining accretion rate calculations from AGN radio surveys and align with the AGN unification model for radio galaxies, revealing a clearer link between accretion disk physics and optical spectral properties.

#### Accretion, Jets, and Recoil in Merging Supermassive Binary Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation that captures the full, self-consistent evolution from the late inspiral through merger and subsequent recoil of a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) with misaligned spins embedded in an equilibrated circumbinary disk (CBD). Our full numerical simulation follows the final 40 orbits of the inspiral and merger of the binary, following an initial phase of 165 orbits of CBD evolution toward equilibrium. We find that the jets, launched from the minidisks surrounding each black hole, are tilted toward the black hole spin direction close to the individual black holes, but align with the binary's total angular momentum at larger distances. Following the merger, the remnant black hole receives a recoil kick exceeding 1000 km/s. Remarkably, it retains its gravitationally bound CBD as if it were ejected from a galactic nucleus. Furthermore, the jet launched by the recoiling remnant black hole preserves the large-scale orientation established during the late inspiral. We demonstrate that the majority of the luminosity emerges from a region in close proximity to the black hole, suggesting that the accretion disk surrounding the recoiling remnant would remain the most luminous feature postmerger, persisting for long enough to be observable by modern telescopes (hours in the case of LISA sources). These findings introduce a direct, first-principles model for the recoil of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), offering a comprehensive theoretical basis to support and elucidate both ongoing and future observational efforts.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a rigorous identification of candidates for dormant black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs) in binaries using summary statistics from Gaia DR3, rather than full orbital solutions. Although Gaia astrometric orbits have already revealed a small sample of compact object binaries, many systems remain undetected due to stringent quality cuts imposed on the published orbits. Using a forward-modelling framework that simulates Gaia observables, in particular the renormalised unit weight error (ruwe) and radial velocity (RV) scatter, we infer posterior distributions for companion mass and orbital period via MCMC sampling, marginalising over nuisance orbital parameters. We validate our approach by comparing the predicted masses and periods against full orbit solutions from DR3, and by successfully recovering known compact object binaries as promising candidates. The method is best suited for systems with red giant primaries, which have more reliable Gaia RV scatter and a light centroid more likely dominated by one component, compared to main-sequence stars. And they are less likely to be triples with short-period inner binaries, which produce confounding signatures. We apply the method to three million giants and identify 556 systems with best-fit companion masses $\gtrsim 3\,M_\odot$. Recovery simulations suggest our selection method is substantially more sensitive than the DR3 non-single-star catalogue, particularly for binaries with periods below 1 year and above $\sim 6$ years. These candidates represent promising targets for spectroscopic follow-up and Gaia DR4 analysis to confirm the presence of compact objects. Candidate main-sequence stars with massive companions face a larger set of confounding effects. Therefore, we present an analogous catalogue of 279 additional `main sequence' candidates only as an appendix.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform a multiprobe analysis combining cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), ACT CMB lensing, and large-scale structure (LSS) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), including DESI Legacy Imaging Survey (LS) galaxies and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). We present the first $5\times2$pt analysis of ACT DR6 lensing, DESI LS, and Planck ISW. Within $\Lambda$CDM, this yields $S_8 = \sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.819 \pm 0.016$, in good agreement with primary CMB inferences and provides a sound-horizon-free Hubble constant constraint of $H_0 = 70.0 \pm 4.4$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Then, combining with CMB primary and BAO, we reconfirm a CMB-BAO discrepancy in the $\Omega_m$-$\frac{D_v}{r_d}$ plane, which is heightened when combining BAO with the $5\times2$pt data vector. We explore two dark-energy extensions that may reconcile this: an early-time modification, early dark energy (EDE), and late-time dynamical dark energy (DDE) parameterized by $w_0w_a$. For CMB primary+BAO+$5\times2$pt, we find a $3.3\sigma$ preference for DDE over $\Lambda$CDM, while EDE is modestly favoured at $2.3\sigma$. The models address different shortcomings of $\Lambda$CDM: DDE relaxes the neutrino mass bound ($M_\nu<0.17$eV vs. $<0.050$eV under $\Lambda$CDM), making it compatible with neutrino oscillation measurements, while EDE raises the Hubble constant to $H_0=70.5\pm1.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, easing the discrepancy with SH0ES. However, neither model resolves both issues simultaneously. Our analysis indicates that both DDE and EDE remain viable extensions of $\Lambda$CDM within current uncertainties and demonstrates the capacity of combined probes to place increasingly stringent constraints on cosmological parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are among the key targets for future space-based gravitational wave detectors. The gravitational waveforms emitted by EMRIs are highly sensitive to the orbital dynamics of the small compact object, which in turn are determined by the geometry of the underlying spacetime. In this paper, we explore the de- tectability of regular black holes with sub-Planckian curvature, which can be interpreted as regularized versions of the Schwarzschild black hole (RSBH). To do so, we begin by ana- lyzing the metric and geodesics, determining the effective potential, and investigating the marginally bound orbits and the innermost stable circular orbits for timelike particles. Our analysis reveals that orbital radius, angular momentum, and energy significantly depend on the model parameter {\alpha} for both orbits. Our main aim is to focus on the influence of the model parameter on a specific kind of orbit, the periodic orbit, surrounding a supermassive RSBH. The findings show that, for a constant rational integer, {\alpha} has a significant impact on the energy and angular momentum of the periodic orbit. Utilising the numerical kludge method, we further investigate the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial body over various periodic orbits. The waveforms display discrete zoom and spin phases within a complete orbital period, influenced by the RSBH parameter {\alpha}. As the system evolves, the phase shift in the gravitational waveforms grows progressively more pronounced, with cumulative deviations amplifying over time. With the ongoing advancements in space- based gravitational wave detection systems, our results will aid in leveraging EMRIs to probe and characterize the RSBH properties.

#### Analytic and accurate approximate metrics for black holes with arbitrary rotation in beyond-Einstein gravity using spectral methods

 - **Abstract**
 A key obstacle for theory-specific tests of general relativity is the lack of accurate black-hole solutions in beyond-Einstein theories, especially for moderate to high spins. We address this by developing a general framework--based on spectral and pseudospectral methods--to obtain analytic, closed-form spacetimes representing stationary, axisymmetric black holes in effective-field-theory extensions of general relativity to leading order in the coupling constants. The approach models the spacetime (and extra fields) as a stationary, axisymmetric deformation of the Kerr metric in Boyer-Lindquist-like coordinates, expands metric deformations as a spectral series in radius and polar angle, and converts the resulting beyond-Einstein field equations into algebraic equations for the spectral coefficients. For any given spin, these equations are solved via standard linear-algebra methods; the coefficients are then fitted as functions of spin with non-linear functions, yielding fully analytic metrics for rotating black holes in beyond-Einstein theories. We apply this to quadratic gravity theories--dynamical Chern-Simons, scalar-Gauss-Bonnet, and axi-dilaton gravity--obtaining solutions valid for any spin, including near-extremal cases with errors below machine precision for $a \leq 0.9$ and $\lesssim 10^{-8}$ for $a \leq 0.999$. We show that existing slowly-rotating solutions break down at $a \sim (0.2, 0.6)$, depending on approximation order and chosen accuracy. We then use our metrics to compute observables, such as the surface gravity, horizon angular velocity, and the locations of the innermost circular orbit and the photon ring. The framework is general and applicable to other effective-field-theory extensions for black holes of any spin.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive study of the Kerr-Newman quasinormal mode spectrum in the Dudley-Finley approximation, where the linear gravitoelectromagnetic perturbations are decoupled by "freezing" either one of the fields to its background value. First, we reassess the accuracy of this approximation by comparing it to calculations that solve the coupled system of gravitoelectromagnetic perturbation equations across the subextremal spin-charge parameter space. We find that for the $(\ell,m,n) = (2,2,0)$, $(2,2,1)$, and $(3,3,0)$ modes, the agreement is typically within $10\%$ and $1\%$ for the real and imaginary parts of the frequencies, respectively. Next, we investigate the spectrum in the near-extremal limit, and study the family of long-lived ("zero-damped") gravitational modes. We find that the near-extremal parameter space consists of subregions containing either only zero-damped modes, or zero-damped modes alongside modes that retain nonzero damping. We derive analytic expressions for the boundaries between these regions. Moreover, we discuss the connection between the zero-damped and damped modes in the Dudley-Finley approximation and the "near-horizon/photon-sphere" modes of the full Kerr-Newman spectrum. Finally, we analyze the behavior of the quadrupolar gravitational modes with large overtone numbers $n$, and study their trajectories in the complex plane.

#### Nonsingular Schwarzschild-de Sitter black holes in finite conformal quantum gravity

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we prove that the classical Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime is an exact solution of a class of weakly non-local, UV finite conformal quantum gravity theories, without the necessity of including a cosmological constant term in the action, thus associating the effective cosmological constant $\Lambda$ appearing in the metric with the coupling constants of the quantum gravity theory. Furthermore, exploiting the inherent conformal symmetry of the theory, we take advantage of the natural enlargement of the exact solutions to motivate the construction of a regular spacetime via conformal rescaling of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. Moreover, we ensure the spacetime completeness by investigating the regularity of the curvature invariants and the geodesic completeness of conformally/non-conformally coupled massive and massless particles. We also study the global causal structure by explicitly constructing the Penrose diagram of the regular spacetime. Furthermore, as a result of the spacetime completeness analysis, we generalize the range of conformal factors that generate regular spacetimes, by considering the $N$ parameter of the conformal factor as a real parameter with a lower bound, and not only a positive integer, as constrained in previous studies on regular Schwarzschild/Kerr black holes. Thus, the present analysis broadens the range of solutions of the finite conformal quantum theory and opens the window to more precise observational tests of the theory using astrophysical data, by considering the accelerated expansion of the universe.

#### Motions of spinning particles in the Kerr-Newman black hole exterior and gravitational wave emission. I. Periodic orbits

 - **Abstract**
 The motion of a spinning particle in the exterior of the Kerr-Newman black hole is studied. The dynamics is governed by the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations in the pole-dipole approximation through the spin-curvature coupling to the leading order in its spin. In terms of conserved quantities, one can transform the dynamical equations in the Mino time into an integral form for both aligned and misaligned spins with orbital motion. These non-geodesic equations can be solved analytically with the solutions involving Jacobi elliptic functions. The radial potential can be derived in order to study the parameter space of the particle for various types of orbit, based on its roots obtained with the corrections of the particle's spin. We consider motion oscillating around two turning points, which are the two outermost roots of the radial potential on the equatorial plane in the misaligned case. In this case, there is an induced oscillatory motion out of the equatorial plane. In particular, the oscillation periods of the motion are obtained. When the orbits become a source of gravitational wave emission, these periods of motion will play a key role in determining the gravitational waves in the frequency domain. Numerical kludge waveforms are constructed. The gravitational wave amplitudes are found to be sensitive to the turning points of the orbits as measured from the black holes. The implications for gravitational wave emission due to extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a parametric study of the spacetime structures in the dyonic Reissner-Nordström solution in Weyl's conformal theory of gravity. We derive expressions for photon sphere radii and horizons for this metric in terms of the conformal gravity parameters, from which we then obtain analytic formulae for extremal limits and Hawking temperatures. Due to the surprising lack of the inverse quadratic $1/r^2$ term in this fourth-order metric, there is no guarantee for the innermost horizon of a black hole spacetime to be a Cauchy horizon, which is in direct contrast to the corresponding metric in general relativity. For example, for certain parameter values, a ``nested black hole'' is seen to exist; in such a spacetime, we find a Cauchy horizon trapped between two event horizons, which is not a structure known to be obtainable in standard general relativity. In addition to such exotic spacetimes, we also find a critical value for the electric and magnetic charges, at which the stable and unstable photon spheres of the metric merge, and we obtain extremal limits where three horizons collide.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the optical properties of black holes endowed with primary Proca hair, focusing on the distinctive double-peak structure generated in the effective potential by the massive vector field. This novel feature drastically modifies the geodesic motion of both photons and massive particles, leading to qualitatively new dynamical and observational signatures. We derive and analyze the effective potentials, classify time-like and null geodesics, and identify the conditions for multiple circular orbits. Particular attention is devoted to the photon sphere structure, the associated shadows, and lensing phenomena. Our analysis reveals that, for a broad range of parameters, the black-hole shadow can acquire a two-boundary structure and exhibit additional inner rings, unlike the standard Schwarzschild case. These modifications provide potentially observable imprints of Proca hair in electromagnetic spectra, highlighting the relevance of double-barrier optical phenomena for current and future observations of strong-gravity environments.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct a new class of smooth, horizonless, non-supersymmetric solutions in five-dimensional minimal supergravity, which we call rotating topological stars. Built from a Kerr-Taub-bolt geometry embedded in five dimensions, they constitute the first rotating generalization of the topological star compatible with both smoothness in the interior and standard Kaluza-Klein asymptotics, S$^1\times\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$. The solutions carry angular momentum, magnetic and electric charges, and form a discrete tower of states labeled by a primary quantum number controlling the spin. Remarkably, despite lying outside the black-hole extremality bound, they can approach arbitrarily closely (in conserved charges) the Kerr black string with a large boost along the fifth dimension, making them relevant prototypes for rotating and astrophysical black-hole microstates. We analyze their geometry in detail, including their gravitational multipoles that can significantly deviate from those of black holes and the presence of an ergoregion, and show that both geodesics and scalar perturbations separate, paving the way for analyzing their dynamics in future work.

 - **Abstract**
 We identify singularity-free Running-Kerr-Taub-Bolt solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity that descend to four-dimensional rotating solutions with flat-space asymptotics. We compute their spin-induced quadrupole moment and find that for a certain range of charges this quadrupole moment is positive. This behavior differs from the Kerr black hole and from most other spinning objects constructed with ``normal'' four-dimensional matter, and we discuss the top-down physics of these solutions that could be responsible for this unusual behavior.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce manifestly duality invariant generating function of the index of single centered black holes in the heterotic string theory compactified on a six dimensional torus. This function is obtained by subtracting, from the inverse of the Igusa cusp form, the generating function of the index of two centered black holes constructed from the Dedekind eta function. We also study the analytic properties of this function in the Siegel upper half plane.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) and holographic complexity (HC) for three-dimensional dyonic quantum black holes, incorporating corrections arising from bulk quantum fields in the setup of double holography. We investigate the holographic entanglement entropy through the holographic Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) prescription and the island prescription. Using RT extremization, we evaluate HEE for connected and disconnected (island) surfaces and show islands emerge when RT surfaces intersect the brane; entanglement entropy grows with subregion size and ultimately saturates for quantum black holes as well as dressed defects. For complexity, we analyze both CV (perturbative) and CA (exact, all-orders) prescriptions: the leading quantum corrections feature universal behavior and the late-time growth can be expressed in thermodynamic variables, obeying generalized Lloyd-type bounds. In contrast, quantum dressed defects exhibit vanishing late-time growth. The CA prescription proves to be more tractable nonperturbatively and yields a thermodynamic interpretation of complexity growth.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics of spherically symmetric, charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The gravitational thermodynamics of Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes can be extended by allowing for variations of the cosmological constant and Newton's constant. In the dual CFT this corresponds to including the central charge C and its chemical potential $\mu$ as a new pair of conjugate thermodynamic variables. In addition, compared to Einstein's theory of gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity introduces higher-order curvature terms. The coupling constants of these higher-order curvature terms $\alpha$ can serve as new thermodynamic quantities, which will also be dual to thermodynamic quantities on the boundary CFT, a feature not present in the CFT dual to Einstein's gravity previously. Based on the holographic dictionary, we consider the critical behavior and phase transition phenomena of the CFT description of the charged Gauss-Bonnet black holes in $d=4$ and $d=5$ in ensemble at fixed $(C, \mathcal{V}, \tilde{Q}, \tilde{\mathcal{A}})$. We find that the conventional description of free energy cannot adequately describe the phase transitions and critical behavior of the CFT in this ensemble. Perhaps a new understanding and description should be introduced.

#### Holographic Thermodynamics of Higher-Dimensional AdS Black Holes with CFT Rescaling

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study the thermodynamic behavior of charged AdS black holes in higher-dimensional spacetimes within the framework of conformal holographic extended thermodynamics. This formalism is based on a novel AdS/CFT dictionary in which the conformal rescaling factor of the boundary conformal field theory (CFT) is treated as a thermodynamic parameter, while Newton's constant is held fixed and the AdS radius is allowed to vary. We explore how variations in the CFT state, represented by its central charge, influence the bulk thermodynamics, phase structure, and stability of black holes in five and six dimensions. Our analysis reveals the emergence of Van der Waals like phase transitions and critical phenomena governed by the central charge. Additionally, we find that the thermodynamic behavior of AdS black holes is affected by the dimensionality of the bulk spacetime, as we compare higher-dimensional black holes to lower-dimensional ones, such as BTZ black holes. These findings provide new insights into the role of boundary degrees of freedom in shaping the thermodynamics of gravitational systems via holography.

#### Hayden--Preskill Model via Local Quenches

 - **Abstract**
 We model the Hayden--Preskill (HP) information recovery protocol in 2d CFTs via local joining quenches. Euclidean path integrals with slits prepare the HP subsystems: the message $M$, its reference $N$, the Page-time black hole $B$, the early radiation $E$, and the late radiation $R$; the remaining black hole after emitting $R$ is denoted as $B'$. The single-slit geometry provides an analytically tractable toy model, while the bounded-slit geometry more closely captures the HP setup. In the free Dirac fermion 2d CFT, the mutual information $I(N\!:\!B')$ shows quasi-particle dynamics with partial or full revivals, whereas that in holographic 2d CFTs, which are expected to be maximally chaotic, exhibit sharp transitions: in the bounded-slit case, when the size of the late radiation becomes comparable to that of the reference $N$, $I(N\!:\!B')$ does vanish at late time, otherwise it remains finite. This contrast between free CFTs and holographic CFTs gives a clear characterization of the HP recovery threshold.
