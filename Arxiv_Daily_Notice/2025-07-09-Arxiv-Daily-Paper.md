 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present and characterize the galaxy cluster catalog detected by the WaZP cluster finder, which is not based on red-sequence identification, on the full six years of observations of the Dark Energy Survey (DES-Y6). The full catalog contains over 400k detected clusters with richnesses, Ngals, above 5 and that reach redshifts up to 1.3. We also provide a version of the catalog where the observation depth and richness computation are homogenized to be used for cosmology, containing 33k rich (Ngals >25) clusters. We compare our results with the previous WaZP catalog obtained from the DES first-year data release (DES-Y1). We find that essentially all clusters within the common footprint and depth limit are recovered. The deeper observations on DES-Y6 and the more complete available spectroscopic redshift sample lead to improvements in the redshifts of the clusters, resulting in an average scatter of 1.4% and offset of 0.2%. The optical clusters are also cross-matched with Sunyaev Zel'dovich Effect (SZE) cluster samples detected by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). We find that essentially all SZE clusters with reasonable overlapping footprint have a corresponding WaZP cluster. Conversely, 90% of the optical detections with richness greater than 150 have a counterpart in the deeper regions of the SZE surveys. Based on cross-match with the SZE catalogs, we also find that 15-20% of the SZE matched systems have more than one possible WaZP counterpart at the same redshift and within the SZE R500c, indicating possible interacting or unrelaxed systems. Finally, given the optical and SZE beams, WaZP and SZE centerings are found to be consistent. A more detailed study of the SZE-WaZP mass-richness relation will be presented in a separate paper.

 - **Abstract**
 The orbits of planetary systems can be deformed from their initial configurations due to close encounters with larger astrophysical bodies. Typical candidates for close encounters are stars and binaries. We explore the prospect that if there is a sizeable population of primordial black holes (PBH) in our galaxy, then these may also impact the orbits of exoplanets. Specifically, in a simplified setting, we study numerically how many planetary systems might have a close encounter with a PBH, and analyze the potential changes to the orbital parameters of systems that undergo PBH flybys.

 - **Abstract**
 The dynamical stability of differentially rotating neutron stars, including hypermassive neutron stars, is of paramount importance in understanding the fate of the post-merger remnant of binary neutron stars mergers and the formation of a black hole during core collapse supernovae. We study systematically the dynamical stability of differentially rotating neutron stars within a broad range of masses, rotation rates and degrees of differential rotation, modeled as polytropes with $\Gamma=2$. We pay particular attention to quasi-toroidal configurations that are outside the parameter space region explored in previous works. We estimate the limits of the region of stability against quasi-radial perturbations by performing an extensive set of numerical simulations. We find that some of the stability criteria proposed in the past are not sufficient nor necessary to determine stability if differential rotation is present and propose a new more general criterion. We show that there is a large parameter space that allows for quasi-toroidal configurations that will not collapse immediately to a black hole and that can sustain masses up to $\sim 2.5$ times the maximum mass of a non-rotating neutron star.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae have provided fundamental observational data in the discovery of the late acceleration of the expansion of the Universe in cosmology. However, this analysis has relied on the assumption of a Gaussian distribution for the data, a hypothesis that can be challenged with the increasing volume and precision of available supernova data. In this work, we rigorously assess this Gaussianity hypothesis and analyze its impact on parameter estimation for dark energy cosmological models. We utilize the Pantheon+ dataset and perform a comprehensive statistical, analysis including the Lilliefors and Jarque-Bera tests, to assess the normality of both the data and model residuals. We find that the Gaussianity assumption is untenable and that the redshift distribution is more accurately described by a t-distribution, as indicated by the Kolmogorov Smirnov test. Parameters are estimated for a model incorporating a nonlinear cosmological interaction for the dark sector. The free parameters are estimated using multiple methods, and bootstrap confidence intervals are constructed for them.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we present the development and the results of a new search pipeline for short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) in the publicly available data from the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi satellite. This pipeline uses rigorous statistical methods that are designed to maximize the information extracted from the Fermi/GBM detectors. Our approach differs substantially from existing search efforts in several aspects: The pipeline includes the construction of template banks, Poisson matched filtering, background estimation, background misestimation correction, automatic routines to filter contaminants, statistical estimation of the signal location and a quantitative estimator of the signal probability to be of a cosmological, terrestrial, or solar origin. Our analysis also includes operating the pipeline on "time-slided" copies of the data, which allows exact significance assessment and $p_{\text{astro}}$ computation, akin to the state-of-the-art gravitational waves (GW) data analysis pipelines. Depending on the spectral properties of the bursts, our pipeline achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement by a factor of 2 to 15 over the onboard GBM triggering algorithm. This enhancement increases the detectable volume for sGRBs and results in an approximate 50% increase in sGRB detections in the 2014 GBM dataset. As a further consequence of the sensitivity increase, we detect hundreds of soft gamma-ray flares of galactic origin. This improved sensitivity enhances the chances of detecting fainter, off-axis GRBs that would likely fall below the standard triggering thresholds. Applying this pipeline to the full GBM archive is expected to expand further the joint sGRB-GW detection volume.

 - **Abstract**
 The growing evidence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) being present in the early Universe poses challenges to their traditional formation pathways. Separately, studies suggest that merging SMBH binaries with total masses $\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ could be the primary sources of the nanohertz gravitational wave background detected by the Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Owing to their extreme masses, these SMBHs have a higher probability of forming earlier than their lower-mass counterparts. In this work, we provide a formalism to calculate the implications of early seeded SMBHs for the PTA signal. As an application, we explore the two most prominent scenarios of high-$z$ SMBHs seeding mechanisms: direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) and collapse of supermassive dark stars (SMDSs). We show that SMDS-seeded SMBHs, with comoving seed number density of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \, {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ can be the dominant contributor to the PTA signal, with mass $> 10^9 M_\odot$ binaries acquiring a peak merger rate at $z< 1$. By contrast, SMBHs seeded via the DCBH channel may contribute only sub-dominantly unless produced with a much larger number density than implied by numerical simulations. Our analysis further suggests that the seed number density should be $< \mathcal{O}(10^{-1}) \, {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ in order to not over-predict the expected PTA signal.

 - **Abstract**
 We study cosmic magnification beyond lensing in a late-time universe dominated by quintessence and cold dark matter. The cosmic magnification angular power spectrum, especially going beyond the well-known lensing effect, provides an independent avenue for investigating the properties of quintessence, and hence, dark energy. By analysing the magnification power spectrum at different redshifts, it is possible to extract new information about the large-scale imprint of dark energy, including whether we are able to disentangle different models from one another. Using three well-known quintessence models, we analyse the cosmic magnification angular power spectrum while taking relativistic corrections into account. We found that it will be difficult to distinguish between quintessence models, and quintessence from the cosmological constant, in lensing magnification angular power spectrum on large scales, at redshifts $z \,{\leq}\, 1$; whereas, when relativistic corrections are incorporated, the total magnification angular power spectrum holds the potential to distinguish between the models, at the given $z$. At $z \,{\geq}\, 3$, the lensing magnification angular power spectrum can be a reasonable approximation of the total magnification angular power spectrum. We also found that both the total relativistic and the Doppler magnification signals, respectively, surpass cosmic variance at $z \,{\leq}\, 0.5$: hence the effect may be detectable at the given $z$. On the other hand, the ISW and the time-delay magnification signals, respectively, are surpassed by cosmic variance on all scales, at epochs up to $z \,{=}\, 4.5$, with the gravitational-potential magnification signal being zero.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we consider FRW universe filled with matter, non-minimally coupling (NMC) scalar field under $V(\phi) = V_{0}\phi^{2}$ potential and holographic vacuum energy. Dark energy is contributed from both holographic vacuum energy and the NMC scalar field. NMC effective gravitational constant $G_\text{eff}(\phi)$, is naturally defined at the action level. Therefore, the gravitational constant in the holographic vacuum density is an effective one, i.e. $ \rho_{\Lambda} = {3c^{2}}/{8\pi G_{\text{eff}}L^{2}}\,. $ Apparent horizon is chosen as IR holographic cutoff scale as it is a trapped null surface. There are nine fixed points in this dynamical system with four independent dimensionless parameters. We consider flat case and find that viable cosmological evolution follows the sequence: an initial stiff-fluid-dominated phase, transitioning through a nearly dust-dominated era, and eventually reaching a stable dark energy-dominating state. Stability analysis requires that $\xi <0$ and $0 < c < 1$ for the theory to be physically valid. Since zero NMC coupling, $\xi=0$, is not allowed in the autonomous system, the model can not completely recover canonical scalar field case. That is to say, as $\xi \rightarrow 0^-$ and $c \rightarrow 0^+$, the model can only approach the canonical scalar case but can not completely recover it. To approach dust or stiff fluid dominations, both magnitudes of the NMC coupling and the holographic parameter must be small. Numerical integration shows that for any allowed values of $\xi$ and $c$, $w_\text{eff}$ approaches $-1$ at late times. Increasing of $c$ does not change shape of the $w_{\rm eff}$, but larger $c$ increases $w_\text{eff}$. As $\xi$ becomes stronger, dust era gradually disappears. Good behaviors of the dynamics require $-1 \ll \xi <0$ and $0 < c \ll 1$.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we explore the cosmological implications of a modified gravity theory characterized by the function \( f(R, \Sigma, T) \), where \( R \) is the Ricci scalar, \( \Sigma \) represents a geometric deformation term, and \( T \) denotes the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The model is reconstructed under the framework of three fundamental energy conditions: Null Energy Condition (NEC), Dominant Energy Condition (DEC), and Strong Energy Condition (SEC). We derive the corresponding Hubble parameter \( H(z) \) for each case and constrain the free parameters \( H_0 \), \( \alpha \), and \( \beta \) using the latest Cosmic Chronometer (CC) and Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernova datasets. A thorough analysis of physical quantities such as pressure, energy density, and the equation of state parameter is carried out. Furthermore, diagnostic tools including the deceleration parameter \( q(z) \), statefinder parameters \( \{r, s\} \), and the $O_m(z)$ diagnostic are employed to assess the models viability. Our findings suggest that the model can consistently describe late-time cosmic acceleration and offers distinct behavior under different energy conditions, all while aligning with current observational data.
#### Wigner's friend's black hole adventure: an argument for complementarity?

 - **Abstract**
 At the heart of both black hole physics and Wigner's friend scenarios lies the question of unitarity. In Wigner's friend setups, sealed-lab measurements are modeled unitarily, probing the measurement problem. In black hole physics, the unitarity problem concerns information preservation in evaporation. We extend a recent analogy between these two puzzles exposed by Hausmann and Renner [arXiv:2504.03835v1] by constructing new paradoxes that merge black hole physics with nonlocal extensions of Wigner's friend scenarios into a unified argument. We briefly discuss possible resolutions.
#### Limiting Geometry and Spectral Instability in Schwarzschild--de Sitter Spacetimes

 - **Abstract**
 We revisit the quasinormal mode problem in Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetimes providing a unified infrastructure tailored for studying limiting configurations. Geometrically, we employ the hyperboloidal framework to explicitly implement Geroch's rigorous limiting procedures for families of spacetimes. This enables a controlled transition between Schwarzschild, de Sitter, and Nariai geometries. Numerically, we introduce the analytical mesh refinement technique into quasinormal mode calculations, successfully recovering -- within the appropriate limiting scenarios -- both known families of quasinormal modes: complex light-ring modes and purely imaginary de Sitter modes. We interpret these results in terms of spectral instability, where the notions of stable and unstable modes depends on the specific spacetime limit under consideration. In the Schwarzschild limit, de Sitter modes appear as a destabilizing effect on the continuous branch cut at $\omega = 0$. Conversely, the branch cut can be understood as emerging from an infinite accumulation of discrete modes at $\omega = 0$ in the transitional regime. We propose a heuristic measure of QNM density to characterize this accumulation and highlight the need for a more rigorous study of potential branch cut instabilities--especially relevant in the context of late-time gravitational wave signals. The proposed infrastructure provides a general and extensible framework for investigations in more complex spacetimes, such as Reissner--Nordström--de Sitter or Kerr--Newman--de Sitter.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the structure and properties of the canonical energy momentum tensor (EMT) across a range of field theories. We begin by developing a unified and systematic method that naturally yields the canonical EMT for gauge theory, without the need for artificial symmetrization or improvement terms. Our analysis highlights how Noether's theorem intrinsically emphasizes the 1-form nature of gauge potentials. We further extend to general relativity and demonstrate that the assumption of metric compatibility naturally implies a torsion free connection. Building upon variational symmetry principles, we establish the equivalence between the Einstein Hilbert EMT and the canonical EMT, thereby clarifying their respective roles in field dynamics and conservation laws. Lastly, we present an alternative derivation of the Einstein field equations via Noether's theorem.
#### Addressing the Hubble Tension: Insights from Reversible and Irreversible Thermodynamic Processes

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the role of reversible and irreversible thermodynamic processes in a cosmological context, focusing on their impact on the early and late-time expansion history of the universe. In our framework, gravitationally induced adiabatic matter creation/annihilation are treated as irreversible processes, while energy exchange between the cosmic bulk and the horizon is modeled as reversible. We propose two thermodynamic interacting scenarios with matter creation/annihilation in which energy flows from matter and radiation components to an effective entropic dark energy sector. In both scenarios, effective entropic dark energy initially exhibits properties akin to those of radiation and matter prior to recombination. Subsequently, it transitions into a quintessence state, ultimately converging towards the cosmological constant in the current epoch. Our models predict Hubble constant values of $H_0 = 71.73 \pm 0.79 \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $H_0 = 71.06 \pm 0.79 \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, which exhibit agreement with the recent 2024 SH0ES measurement of $H_0 = 73.17 \pm 0.86 \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ at levels of $1.2\sigma$ and $1.8\sigma$. When compared to the 2022 SH0ES baseline measurement of $H_0 = 73.04 \pm 1.04 \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, both models demonstrate concordance at $1\sigma$ and $1.5\sigma$. These results demonstrate that such thermodynamically motivated interactions can address the Hubble tension within a minimal extension of the standard cosmological model.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper explores the properties of black holes using a new model of nonlinear electrodynamics called modified Maxwell (ModMax), in conjunction with nonlinear massive gravity known as dRGT-like massive gravity. We start by deriving the exact black hole solutions within the framework of ModMax-dRGT-like massive gravity and analyze how the parameters of both ModMax and dRGT-like massive gravity influence the characteristics of these black holes. Additionally, we calculate the thermodynamic quantities for these black holes in the non-extended phase space and investigate how the parameters of ModMax and dRGT-like massive gravity affect these quantities. We confirm that these quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. We also examine local stability by analyzing heat capacity and assess how ModMax and the massive parameters influence phase transitions and physical limitation points. Next, we expand our analysis to the extended phase space, demonstrating that these thermodynamic quantities satisfy both the first law of thermodynamics and the Smarr relation in this context. Finally, we examine the isoperimetric ratio of black holes in ModMax-dRGT-like massive gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the gravitational waveforms generated by critical, equatorial plunging geodesics of the Kerr metric that start from an unstable-circular-orbit, which describe the test-mass limit of spin-aligned eccentric black-hole mergers. The waveforms are generated employing a time-domain Teukolsky code. We span different values of the Kerr spin $-0.99 \le a \le 0.99 $ and of the critical eccentricity $e_c$, for bound ($0 \le e_c<1$) and unbound plunges ($e_c \ge 1$). We find that, contrary to expectations, the waveform modes $h_{\ell m}$ do not always manifest a peak for high eccentricities or spins. In case of the dominant $h_{22}$ mode, we determine the precise region of the parameter space in which its peak exists. In this region, we provide a characterization of the merger quantities of the $h_{22}$ mode and of the higher-order modes, providing the merger structure of the equatorial eccentric plunges of the Kerr spacetime in the test-mass limit.
#### Constraint on Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity with Different Dark energy Parametrizations from DESI DR2 BAO Data

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05975

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the cosmological viability of symmetric teleparallel gravity, specifically the $f(Q)$ gravity model with a power-law form $f(Q) = \alpha Q^n$, in combination with two widely used dark energy parameterizations: Chevallier Polarski Linder (CPL) and Barboza Alcaniz (BA). Employing the most recent DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) dataset along with previous BAO measurements, we constrain the model parameters through a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. We examine the background evolution via key cosmological indicators including the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, deceleration parameter $q(z)$, the effective equation of state $\omega_{\rm eff}(z)$, and the Om diagnostic. Our results indicate that the inclusion of DESI DR2 data significantly tightens constraints on the model parameters and supports a consistent transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion. The present-day values of $q(0)$ and $\omega_{\rm eff}(0)$ lie within the quintessence regime for all datasets. However, for lower redshift values the behaviour varies between phantom-like and quintessence-like phases. Statistical comparison via $\chi^2$, AIC, BIC, and $R^2$ further demonstrate that both CPL + $f(Q)$ and BA + $f(Q)$ provide better or competitive fits to data compared to $\Lambda$CDM, hence offering a compelling geometric alternative for explaining late-time cosmic acceleration.

 We discuss the conversion mechanism from scalar field to gravitational waves in magnetic background in $f(R)$ gravity minimal coupled to the Maxwell electrodynamics. Applying the conversion in early universe with primordial magnetic field and the neutron star with strong magnetosphere, the generated gravitational waves, converted from the scalar field, exhibit distinct power spectra which can be potentially probed by future experiments such as DECIGO, BBO, CE and ET.
