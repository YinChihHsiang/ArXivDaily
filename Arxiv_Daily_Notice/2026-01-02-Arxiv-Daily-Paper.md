#### A secondary orbiter under collisions with an accretion disk

 - **Abstract**
 Dynamics of stellar orbits in dense stellar systems and nuclear star clusters (NSC) with an embedded supermassive black hole (SMBH) is governed a complex interplay of different forces. In particular, star--star gravitational collisions (relaxation), physical collisions between stars, and the hydrodynamical interaction with any surrounding gaseous environment, such as an accretion disk. These processes influence the stellar distribution, the feeding of the central black hole, and the generation of observable phenomena. Furthermore, the self-gravity of the accretion medium modulates the long-term evolution, adding significant complexity to the system's dynamics. By employing elementary arguments we outline the mentioned influences in their mutual competition.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive long-term, multi-epoch spectral and timing study of the Seyfert 1 Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) Mrk~1040, utilizing X-ray observations spanning from 2009 to 2024 ($\sim$15 years). The source exhibits pronounced spectral and temporal variability, indicative of transitions between different accretion regimes in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole. The earlier reported soft excess is re-examined within a uniform, physically motivated multi-epoch framework. We confirm the presence of this soft excess in the 2009 observation, where it is well described by a warm, extended Comptonizing corona with $kT_{\rm e,warm} \sim 0.26$~keV and a radial extent of $R_{\rm warm} \sim 30~r_g$. In subsequent epochs, the soft excess is not statistically significant, possibly due to a combination of enhanced ionized absorption, intrinsic weakening of the warm Comptonizing region, or partial truncation of the inner disc. A strong correlation between the soft and hard X-ray fluxes suggests a common physical origin for both components, likely within a multi-layered Comptonizing structure that evolved into a compact and thermally stable corona after 2013. The observed spectral variability, together with changes in the Fe~K$\alpha$ line strength, reflects the evolving coronal geometry and accretion flow dynamics. Variations in the intrinsic column density ($N_H$) further indicate that Mrk~1040 is embedded within a clumpy, dynamically variable absorber responding to changes in the accretion rate. Using the TCAF model, we estimate the black hole mass as $M_{\rm BH} = (4.50 \pm 1.62) \times 10^7~M_\odot$, consistent with previous estimates.

 - **Abstract**
 The late-time linear Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect directly probes the dynamics of cosmic acceleration and the nature of dark energy. Detecting these weak, secondary temperature anisotropy signals of the CMB requires accurate theoretical predictions of their amplitude across cosmological models. By extending the pyGenISW package, previously limited to $\Lambda$CDM, we aim to generate full-sky ISW maps for a suite of 791 $w$CDM cosmologies using the Gower Street N-body simulations, thereby enabling ISW analyses across a broader dark-energy parameter space. We make our code and ISW data publicly available. We compute the ISW signals by tracing the time evolution of the gravitational potential across large-volume simulations that span dark energy equation of state parameters from phantom to quintessence, $-1.79 \lesssim w \lesssim -0.34$. These data are projected onto the sphere using HEALPix to obtain full-sky temperature maps. We validate our pipeline by comparing the measured ISW angular power spectra and ISW-density cross-correlations against linear theory expectations ($2 \leq \ell \leq 200$) computed with benchmarks from the pyCCL library. The agreement is excellent across the multipole range where the ISW contribution is expected to dominate, confirming the reliability of our modelling of gravitational-potential evolution. With additional tests of the ISW signal's strength in density extrema, as well as comparing all models to a reference $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we found that quintessence-like models ($w > -1$) show higher ISW amplitudes than phantom models ($w < -1$), consistent with enhanced late-time decay of gravitational potentials. The consistency of our $w$CDM ISW maps and their agreement with theory predictions confirm the robustness of our methodology, establishing it as a reliable tool for theoretical and observational ISW-LSS analyses.

#### A Convolutional Neural Network for the Recovery of Transfer Functions From Velocity-Resolved Reverberation Mapping Data

 - **Abstract**
 One of the hallmarks of active galactic nuclei are that they are highly variable with time. In watching the spectra vary it has been observed that the emission-lines often appear to "reverberate" -- that is they vary in response to continuum variations assumed to originate close to the black hole. This critical observation underlies the reverberation mapping technique, an elegant physics experiment that has allowed us to characterize the environment around many supermassive black holes in nearby active galactic nuclei. Recent observations are of such quality that the response can be measured as a function of velocity across the emission-line, and in doing so we can construct velocity-delay maps that show the structure and physics of the gas in the broad-line region better than any other measurement to date. Unfortunately constructing such maps requires a deconvolution, and given that the data are often noisy and with gaps such deconvolutions are non-trivial. Here we present a novel deconvolution method for the recovery of velocity-delay maps using a custom convolutional neural network architecture, showcasing that such methods have great promise for the deconvolution of reverberation mapping data products. While we have designed this new method with the BLR in mind, in principle this technique could be applied to any reverberation deconvolution problem, including in the accretion disk and torus.

#### Cosmic Himalayas in CROCODILE : Probing the Extreme Quasar Overdensities by Count-in-Cells analysis and Nearest Neighbor Distribution

 - **Abstract**
 The recently reported Cosmic Himalayas (CH) -- an extreme quasar overdensity at z~2 -- poses an apparent challenge to the Lambda CDM framework, with a reported significance of 16.9-sigma under Gaussian assumptions. Such an event appears improbably rare, with a formal probability of P ~ 10^-68. In this work, we investigate whether CH-like structures can naturally arise in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. Using the CROCODILE simulation, which self-consistently models galaxy-black hole coevolution, we examine quasar clustering through two complementary approaches: the count-in-cells (CIC) statistic, which probes large-scale overdensities, and the nearest-neighbor distribution (NND), sensitive to small-scale environments. CIC analysis reveals that the underlying distribution is heavy-tailed and non-Gaussian, and that conventional Gaussian-based evaluation substantially overestimates the significance of extreme events. When modeled with an asymmetric generalized normal distribution (AGND), the inferred rarity of the CH is substantially reduced and reconciled with standard Lambda CDM; for instance, regions appearing as 12-sigma outliers under Gaussian assumptions (P ~ 10^-33) are found to occur in the AGND regime with a probability of P ~ 10^-4. NND analysis further demonstrates that extreme overdense regions within the simulation can naturally sustain two-point correlation function values similar to those observed in the CH (r0 ~ 30 Mpc/h), suggesting that the strong clustering stems from sample selection biases and local environmental variations. These two analyses conclusively highlight the importance of adopting non-Gaussian statistics when quantifying extreme overdensities of quasars and establish that the CH is not an anomaly, but a natural outcome of structure formation in the Lambda CDM universe.

#### Comment on "Regular magnetically charged black holes from nonlinear electrodynamics: Thermodynamics, light deflection, and orbital dynamics" by Aydiner, Sucu and Sakalli

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23783

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the recent article by Aydiner, Sucu, and Sakalli [Phys.\ Dark Univ.\ \textbf{50}, 102164 (2025)] [arXiv:2507.05145], which investigates the thermodynamics, tunneling kinetics, and weak-lensing signatures of a regular, magnetically charged nonlinear-electrodynamics black hole. While the study addresses interesting phenomenological questions, we identify several inconsistencies that compromise the validity of the reported results. Specifically, we note mutually contradictory values for the extremal charge separating the black hole and horizonless regimes, an inaccurate characterization of the Schwarzschild limit as an extremal configuration, a vacuum weak-deflection expansion that fails to recover the standard second-order Schwarzschild coefficient, and a sign error in the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) corrected tunneling probability. We also highlight terminology regarding the nature of the horizonless solution and the physical interpretation of plasma parameters that requires correction. We clarify these points to ensure the robustness of the model's asymptotic limits.

#### Kerr Perihelion Precession via the Laplace-Runge-Lenz Vector Method

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.23871

 - **Abstract**
 We calculate, up to the first-order in the black hole spin, the perihelion precession of a test particle in the equatorial plane of a Kerr black hole using the perturbative Laplace-Runge-Lenz (LRL) vector method. To account for the dragging of inertial frames, we modify the LRL vector by incorporating a counteracting term in the angular momentum, which preserves the Keplerian orbit form to first order. We derive the standard Lense-Thirring precession result, leading to a transparent reinterpretation of known results, clarifying the role of frame dragging in LRL-based perturbation methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave (GW) scattering in strong gravitational fields is a central problem in GW lensing. Yet, conventional treatments based on asymptotic expansions suffer from divergences and become unreliable near the optical axis. In this work, we present a rigorous calculation of GW scattering by a Schwarzschild black hole (BH) within the BH perturbation theory. By placing the observer at a finite distance and abandoning the asymptotic expansion of radial wave functions, we obtain a well-convergent partial-wave description without invoking any regularization scheme, thereby naturally resolving the divergences of the partial-wave series and the Poisson spot. We numerically computed the scattered GW waveforms by reconstructing the physical $+$ and $\times$ polarizations from the master variables, revealing the formation of the Poisson spot and pronounced wavefront distortions. A systematic comparison with conventional asymptotic approaches shows that they reproduce only qualitative features at large scattering angles and fail in the forward-scattering region. We further compare the frequency-domain transmission factors derived from the scattering formalism with those obtained from the Kirchhoff diffraction integral, finding significant discrepancies at high frequencies due to the latter's neglect of long-range gravitational effects and polarization evolution. Our results establish a stable and physically transparent framework for GW scattering in strong-field regimes and provide a solid foundation for accurate modeling of GW lensing beyond standard approximations.

#### Charged Dirac perturbations on Reissner-Nordström black holes in a cavity: quasinormal modes with Robin boundary conditions

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate charged Dirac quasinormal spectra on Reissner-Nordström black holes in a mirror-like cavity. For this purpose, we first derive charged Dirac equations, and \textit{two} sets of Robin boundary conditions following the vanishing energy flux principle. The Dirac spectra are then computed both analytically and numerically. Our results reveal a symmetry hidden in the Dirac spectra between two boundary conditions. Moreover, when the cavity is placed close to the event horizon $r_+$, we identify that, in the neutral background the Dirac spectra asymptote to $-(3/8+N/2)i$ [$-(1/8+N/2)i$] for the first [second] boundary condition; while in the charged background the real part of charged Dirac spectra asymptote to $qQ/r_+$ for both boundary conditions; where $N$ is the overtone number, $q$ and $Q$ are charges for the field and for the background. In particular, we uncover a striking anomalous decay pattern, $i.e.$ the excited modes decay \textit{slower} than the fundamental mode, when the charge coupling $qQ$ is large. Our results further illustrate the robustness of vanishing energy flux principle, which are applicable not only to anti-de Sitter black holes but also to black holes in a cavity.

#### Signatures of Quantum-Corrected Black Holes in Gravitational Waves from Periodic Orbits

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24036

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate gravitational wave emission from periodic timelike orbits of a test particle around a loop quantum gravity-inspired Schwarzschild black hole. The spacetime is characterised by a holonomy-correction parameter that modifies the radial metric component while preserving asymptotic flatness and the classical location of the horizon. The bound geodesics are systematically classified using the zoom--whirl representation labelled by three integers $(z,w,v)$. Gravitational waveforms are computed within a numerical framework that combines exact geodesic motion with the quadrupole approximation, which is suitable for extreme mass ratio inspirals. We demonstrate that the quantum corrections lead to distinct phase shifts, amplitude variations, and modifications to the harmonic structure of the waveforms, with increasingly complex features for orbits with larger zoom numbers. The corresponding frequency spectra and characteristic strain peak, which fall within the millihertz band, are within the sensitivity ranges of space-based detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. For specific orbital configurations and values of the quantum-correction parameter, the characteristic strain exceeds the projected detector noise, indicating potential observability. Our results demonstrate that gravitational waves from periodic orbits provide a sensitive probe of quantum-corrected black hole spacetimes in the strong-field regime.

#### Perturbation theory for gravitational shadows in Kerr-like spacetimes

 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24126

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24126

 - **Abstract**
 We present a fully analytical method for calculating the key parameters of a Kerr-like gravitational shadow, including its horizontal and vertical diameters, $D_X$ and $D_Y$, the coordinates of its center $X_{C}$, the average radius $\bar{R}$, the deviation from sphericity $\delta C$, and the mean deviation from the Kerr shadow $\delta K$. Developed within the framework of perturbation theory, this approach yields all characteristic parameters as simple polynomial expressions with an accuracy of $\sim a^5$, where $a$ is the Kerr spin parameter. This eliminates the need for repeated numerical integration of cumbersome parametric equations. Furthermore, our derived formulas account for the effects of a plasma medium - a feature of particular relevance given the prospect of multi-frequency astrophysical observations.

#### Black hole images as probes of thermodynamic evolution

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24174

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how black hole images (shadows and accretion-disk images) encode thermodynamic evolution information across different ensembles, using the Reissner-Nordström-AdS black hole as an illustrative example. Through analytic treatment and numerical verification, we demonstrate that these images encode not only phase transition information but also ensemble information, including additional temperature information in the isothermal ensemble. Phase transition information appears as a sudden increase in image size, which we prove occurs in both isobaric and isothermal ensembles. The ensemble and temperature information originates from a fundamental difference between isobaric and isothermal evolution: image size varies monotonically with the horizon radius along isobars, whereas it exhibits nonmonotonic behavior along isotherms. This contrast serves as a diagnostic tool to distinguish isobaric from isothermal evolution. In the isothermal ensemble, the nonmonotonic behavior introduces an extremal radius whose relative ordering with the small- and large-black hole radii at the phase transition admits three logical possibilities. Our analysis reveals that only two of these possibilities are physically realized, separated by a critical reduced temperature. Furthermore, image evolution in the two resulting temperature intervals exhibits qualitatively differences, demonstrating that black hole images indeed encode temperature information. These results not only enrich the set of observational avenues for probing black hole thermodynamic properties, but also introduce a new paradigm. This paradigm studies phase transitions in conjunction with nonmonotonic evolution, providing a useful framework for exploring thermodynamic imprints in other black hole systems.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the impact of pressure anisotropy on the structural and geometric properties of neutron stars within general relativity, focusing primarily on the phenomenological Bowers-Liang (BL) model, and comparing selected results with a quasi-local prescription. Using the SLy equation of state, we explore how anisotropic stresses modify global observables such as the mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, compactness, and tidal deformability over a broad range of anisotropy parameters. We find that moderate positive anisotropy can increase the maximum supported mass up to approximately $2.4\;M_\odot$ and enhance stellar compactness by up to $20\%$ relative to isotropic configurations, while remaining broadly consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints. To probe the internal gravitational field, we compute curvature invariants including the Ricci scalar, the Ricci tensor contraction, the Kretschmann scalar, and the Weyl scalar. We show that curvature measures directly tied to the matter distribution exhibit a strong sensitivity to anisotropy, whereas the Weyl curvature remains comparatively insensitive, reflecting its role as a measure of the free gravitational field. Within the phenomenological BL framework, the maximum compactness increases with anisotropy and reaches values as high as $\mathcal{C}_{\max}\approx 0.25$-$0.38$ for $\lambda_{\rm BL}\in[-4,+4]$, although the physical realizability of such highly compact configurations depends sensitively on the underlying anisotropy mechanism. A comparison with the quasi-local model highlights the strong model dependence of anisotropic effects, underscoring both the potential significance and the limitations of phenomenological anisotropy prescriptions in modeling strong-field neutron-star interiors.

#### Quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole evaporation and its fate

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24213

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the evaporation of the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole. Within a semiclassical framework, we compute the energy emission of Hawking radiation by introducing a massless scalar field as a test field, considering both minimally and non-minimally coupled cases. For the minimally coupled case, we find that loop quantum gravity effects become crucial at the late stage of the evaporation process, causing the emission rate to slow down and eventually terminate, leading to the formation of a black hole remnant. A quasi-normal mode analysis indicates the stability of this remnant. For the non-minimally coupled case, we show that the fate of the black hole strongly depends on the value of the coupling constant $\xi$. Focusing on the cases $\xi=\pm1$, we find that for $\xi=1$, the energy emission rate accelerates at late times and no remnant is formed, whereas for $\xi=-1$, the emission rate slows down and eventually terminates, resulting in a stable black hole remnant, as supported by the corresponding quasi-normal mode analysis.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24344

 - **Abstract**
 These notes are adapted from six lectures that I delivered at Analogue Gravity in Benasque 2023. They present the unified Gaussian (phase-space) framework to describe linear bosonic quantum systems, the standard tool in quantum optics and continuous-variable quantum information, emphasizing its simplicity and platform independence, with applications to semi-classical black holes and analogue gravity. Parts (I-III) develop the formalism: from harmonic dynamics and Gaussian transformations to state characterization via moments, Wigner functions, and entanglement measures. Part (IV) applies these tools to semi-classical black holes, discussing Hawking radiation and quantum superradiance in rotating black holes, and laboratory analogues in light-matter systems via toy models.

#### Effective Regge-Wheeler equations of a hybrid loop quantum black hole

 - **Abstract**
 A set of effective equations for the gauge-invariant gravitational perturbations in the interior of a spherically symmetric, non-rotating black hole is derived within the framework of hybrid loop quantum cosmology. The quantum zero-mode of the Hamiltonian constraint, obtained from a perturbative gauge-invariant canonical analysis, is explicitly imposed on a class of quantum states whose wavefunctions factorize into a background and a perturbative part, related through a geometric relational variable. These states naturally describe regimes with small perturbative backreaction and lead to an effective Hamiltonian and associated dynamics for the perturbations. The resulting equations take the form of Regge-Wheeler equations modified by expectation values of the quantum black hole geometry, providing a clear characterization of quantum corrections to the classical description of the black hole interior. This framework opens the way to investigating hybrid loop quantum gravity effects in the propagation of gravitational waves.

#### The Upper Bound of Event Horizon Formation Time in Generalized Oppenheimer-Snyder Collapse

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24421

 - **Abstract**
 We prove that, in the framework of the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse, the Schwarzschild exterior maximizes the event horizon formation time $\Delta T_{\text{eh}}=\frac{19}{6}m$ among all asymptotically flat, static, spherically-symmetric black holes with the same ADM mass $m$ that satisfy the weak energy condition. This bound extends the typical black hole inequalities--such as the Penrose inequality, which constrains spatial geometry--to temporal setting.

#### Stellar modeling within regularized 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in light of current astrophysical constraints

 - **Abstract**
 In this study we obtain interior solutions and investigate structural properties of isotropic compact stars in the framework of four-dimensional regularized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity. For stellar matter content, we adopt a widely used quark-matter model that approximates a realistic equation of state (EoS). By numerically integrating the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, we obtain interior solutions for static, spherically symmetric fluid spheres. The resulting sequences are compared directly with the predictions of General Relativity (GR). Our analysis focuses on three diagnostic indicators: (i) the mass-radius profiles under GR and three representative choices of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling; (ii) the stellar compactness factor, $C \equiv M/R$; and (iii) the relation between stellar mass and central energy density. Recent observational studies suggest that the maximum masses inferred from the mass-radius relation may be larger than previously expected. To address this, we include a comparative set of constraints from multi-messenger astrophysical observations, including gravitational-wave event GW190814, as well as X-ray measurements from NICER for PSR~J0740+6620 and PSR~J0030+0451. These data provide stringent, astrophysically grounded tests of the viability of the models discussed here. Our results indicate that compact stars within 4DEGB gravity are systematically less compact and achieve moderately higher maximum masses compared to the GR case. This trend is consistent with recent theoretical analyses of compact stars in higher-curvature gravity theories and with constraints from multi-messenger astrophysics. Together, these findings suggest that regularized Gauss-Bonnet corrections constitute a plausible extension of GR in the strong-field regime.

#### Proca stars and their frozen states in an infinite tower of higher-derivative gravity

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24584

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the five-dimensional Proca star under gravity with the infinite tower of higher curvature corrections. We find that when the coupling constant exceeds a critical value, solutions with a frequency approaching zero appear. In the finite-order corrections case $n=2$ (Gauss-Bonnet gravity), the matter field and energy density diverge near the origin as $\omega\to 0$. In contrast, for $n\geq 3$, the divergence is efficiently suppressed, both the field and the energy density remain finite everywhere, and both the matter field and energy density remain finite everywhere. In the limit $\omega \to 0$, a class of horizonless frozen star solutions emerges, which are referred to ``frozen stars". Importantly, frozen stars contain neither curvature singularities nor event horizons. These frozen stars develop a critical horizon at a finite radius $r_c$, where $-g_{tt}$ and $1/g_{rr}$ approach zero. The frozen star is indistinguishable from that of an extremal black hole outside $r_c$, and its compactness can reach the extremal black hole value.

#### Difference between quark stars and neutron stars in universal relations and their effect on gravitational waves

 - **Abstract**
 We calculate the $f$-mode frequency and tidal overlap of quark stars using the full general relativity method. We verify the universal relations obtained from conventional neutron stars in the case of quark stars and explore the cases with different values of parameters of the quark star equation of state. Since quark stars have significantly smaller radii compared to neutron stars in the low mass range, the relation between the tidal defomability and $f$-mode frequency times radius is different for neutron stars and quark stars. This difference has an impact on dynamical tide, which is the lowest-order effect we know of that can distinguish quark stars and neutron stars from the gravitational wave during the inspiral phase. We calculate the tidal dephasing caused by this effect in the post-Newtonian method and find that it can not be detected even by the next-generation gravitational wave detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave echoes offer a unique probe of the near-horizon structure of astrophysical black holes, beyond the standard ''black hole spectroscopy''. Theoretical waveform predictions, however, remain uncertain, motivating robust searches that avoid specific echo modeling. We present a model-independent search framework targeting long-lived quasinormal modes (QNMs) expected from strong interior reflection. By employing a generalized phase-marginalized likelihood that coherently combines data for each QNM across a detector network, our method enhances sensitivity to the signals. To handle real detector noise, we implement an optimized notching procedure to suppress instrumental spectral lines and refine the Bayesian parameter settings. We validate the performance of this framework using injection studies on O1 background data, demonstrating reliable signal recovery in realistic noise conditions. We then apply this method to three binary black hole merger events with high ringdown signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) from observing runs O1 to O4: GW150914, GW231226, and the recently detected GW250114. No statistically significant evidence for postmerger echoes is found. Consequently, we derive 90% upper limits on the network SNR and the average amplitude of the long-lived QNMs, setting the first model-independent constraints on late-time echo signatures from LVK data.

 With an intent to examine the combined effect of non-linear electrodynamics (NED) and dark matter (DM), we obtain a static and spherically symmetric solution with the black hole (BH) magnetically charged and immersed in the Hernquist DM halo (MHDM). The position of the event horizon $r_h$ and the critical impact parameter $b_m$ are then probed to gauge the extent of influence magnetic charge $g$ and halo parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ have on them. A recurring outcome of our analysis with respect to different BH observables is the nullification of competing effects of charge and halo parameters, leading to observables obtaining values equal to those for a Schwarzschild BH. This is also observed for $r_h$ and $b_m$. We delve into unraveling the impact of NED and DM combined on the strong gravitational lensing (GL) and its related observables, such as the angular separation, relative magnification, and the angular position of the inner, closely packed bright ring. Interestingly, we find combinations of charge and halo parameters that leave the deflection angle unchanged from the Schwarzschild case, thereby leading to a situation where an MHDM BH and a Schwarzschild BH become indistinguishable. Similar results are also observed for lensing observables. Finally, utilizing observations related to the angular diameter of super-massive BHs (SMBHs) $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ and employing the $\chi^2$ test, we extract bounds on $g$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ signifying the viability of our BH model as an SMBH.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the oscillation of the Kasner exponent $p_t$ near critical point of the hairy black holes dual to holographic superfluid and reveal a clear inverse periodicity $f(T_c/(T_c-T))$ in a large region below the critical temperature. We first introduce the fourth-power term with a coefficient $\lambda$ to adjust the oscillatory behavior of the Kasner exponent $p_t$ near the critical point. Importantly, we show that the nonlinear coefficient $\lambda$ provides accurate control of this periodicity: a positive $\lambda$ stretches the region, while a negative $\lambda$ compresses it. By contrast, the influence of another coefficient $\tau$ is more concentrated in regions away from the critical point. This work provides a new perspective for understanding the complex dynamical structure inside black holes and extends the actively control from the fourth- and sixth-power term into the black hole interior region.

 - **Abstract**
 The absence of Birkhoff's theorem in effective quantum gravity models leads to a fundamental ambiguity in the vacuum sector, where a priori no unique vacuum solution exists. As a result, phenomenological investigations of the physical implications of these models have been made more difficult. We address this challenge by establishing a constructive framework which allows to formulate 4D covariant actions from the physical nature of the systems's degrees of freedom, which are dust and gravity, together with two guiding principles. We take advantage of the non-propagating nature of a relational dust clock and the suppression of gravitational waves in spherical symmetry. This structural ultralocality allows for a decomposition of the dynamics into independent LTB shells. We further impose spatial diffeomorphism invariance and a geometric guiding principle, where the latter ensures that a unique and static vacuum solution exists. These assumptions allow to strictly constrain the LTB shell Hamiltonian to a factorised form as well as the static vacuum metric function to a universal form. This constructive framework produces a fully 4D-covariant action that belongs to the class of generalised extended mimetic gravity models. This provides the necessary consistent basis for a perturbation theory in the context of quasi-normal modes or cosmological perturbations beyond the static sector in which quantum gravity effects are also included in linear and higher order perturbations. Furthermore, for this class of models our results resolve the long-standing `curvature polymerisation ambiguity' in loop quantum cosmology by unambiguously determining how flat space modifications are extended to non-flat geometries, thus unifying the description of black holes and cosmology in a single effective framework.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the strong gravitational lensing and shadow properties of the black hole in the context of bumblebee gravity, characterized by a global monopole charge $\kappa\eta^2$ and a Lorentz symmetry breaking parameter $\gamma$. We compute the deflection angles of light passing near the black hole in strong deflection limit, and estimate key lensing observables, including relativistic Einstein rings, absolute magnifications, image separations, and flux ratios, for astrophysical black holes. The black hole shadow is analyzed using the apparent angular size $\theta_{\rm Shadow} = 2\,\theta_{\infty}$ in the limiting photon orbit. Furthermore, we study the modification of the shadow structure in the presence of a radially infalling, optically thin accretion flow within a generalized framework. Our results indicate that both the global monopole charge and Lorentz-violating parameters significantly influence the photon sphere, lensing observables, and shadow morphology, potentially providing observational signatures for testing bumblebee gravity in the strong-field regime.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a well-motivated non-particle candidate for dark matter, requiring an enhancement of curvature perturbations on small inflationary scales consistent with observational constraints. In this work we study PBH production within Horndeski gravity, accounting for compatibility with the GW170817 constraint on the gravitational-wave speed and imposing a constant coupling to the Ricci scalar. Under these conditions, and assuming an inflaton field characterised by a canonical kinetic term and a smooth potential, the inflationary dynamics is controlled by the cubic Horndeski interaction. We show that a suitable kinetic dependence of the latter enhances the effective friction acting on the inflaton, inducing a transient ultra-slow-roll phase embedded in an otherwise standard slow-roll evolution. Interestingly, this mechanism amplifies the curvature power spectrum on small scales without introducing any feature in the potential. For representative parameter choices we find that pronounced peaks in the scalar power spectrum are generated, leading to the formation of asteroid-mass PBHs with masses of order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})\,M_\odot$, which can account for a substantial fraction of the dark matter abundance, reaching $f_{\rm PBH}\simeq 0.9$, while satisfying current observational constraints. The resulting sharp features in the scalar power spectrum also imply potentially observable scalar-induced gravitational-wave signatures.

 - **Abstract**
 This talk gives a short introduction to the ``UV/EFT correspondence", which uses scattering amplitudes to relate the Effective Field Theory (EFT) coefficients probed by low-energy measurements to properties of the underlying high-energy (UV) completion. This includes recent ``positivity bounds" on EFT coefficients, which are the low-energy signatures of causality and unitarity in the UV. To illustrate their phenomenological impact, I apply these bounds to a simple EFT for dark energy and compare with recent cosmological observations.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we compute the conserved currents and charges associated to the action of an infinitesimal isometry (Killing field) in Einstein--Cartan--Palatini gravity. We offer a new approach to these quantities through the formalism of $L_\infty$-algebras and the work of Ćirić, Giotopoulos, Radovanović, and Szabo, and Costello and Gwilliam. We demonstrate our approach by computing the entropy of the Schwarzchild black hole. Along the way, we prove a purely algebraic result about the existence and utility of a higher (a full $\infty$) version of the adjoint action of an $L_\infty$-algebra.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider quadratic curvature perturbation to the Myers-Perry black hole in five dimensions at the linear level in the coupling constant. The solution can then be solved order by order in terms of two dimensionless angular momentum parameters up to an arbitrary order. We present the results up to tenth order. The perturbed solution allows us to obtain the higher-derivative correction to the black hole thermodynamics, which we find is in complete agreement with the Reall-Santos method.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the dynamics of a charged scalar field in the near-horizon region of an extremal charged BTZ black hole. The near-horizon geometry contains an AdS2 throat with a constant electric field, which lowers the effective mass of the scalar and can trigger a violation of the AdS2 Breitenlohner-Freedman bound. We show that this instability is resolved by the formation of a static scalar cloud supported by Schwinger pair production. The condensate backreacts on the gauge field and partially screens the electric flux, leading to a self-consistent stationary configuration. The scalar profile is obtained analytically from the near-horizon equations and exhibits the characteristic behavior of a BF-violating mode in AdS2. We analyze the associated boundary conditions, the induced charge density, and the resulting modification of the electric field. The resulting configuration can be interpreted as an electric analogue of known magnetic hairy black hole solutions. Our results provide a concrete realization of electric screening in extremal charged black holes and clarify the role of near-horizon dynamics in shaping the infrared structure of the solution.

#### Kerr worldline-QFT action from Compton amplitude to infinite spin orders

 - **Abstract**
 We develop a quadratic-in-Riemann worldline action for a Kerr black hole at infinite spin orders by matching to a proposed tree-level Kerr Compton amplitude, originally obtained from higher-spin QFT considerations. A worldline action is an effective theory, and as such the tree-level matching needs to be corrected by loop effects, including UV counter terms, renormalization, and higher-order matching to general relativity. However, we anticipate that many features of the Wilson coefficients of the proposed tree-level action will remain unchanged even after a loop-level matching. While the worldline action is given in closed form, it contains an infinite number of quadratic-in-Riemann operators $R^2$, even for the same-helicity sector. We argue that in the same-helicity sector the $R^2$ operators have no intrinsic meaning, as they merely remove unwanted terms produced by the linear-in-Riemann operators, which are well-established in the literature. The opposite-helicity sector is somewhat more complicated, it contains both $R^2$ operators that removes unwanted terms, and $R^2$ operators that add new needed terms to the Compton amplitude. We discuss and classify all independent $R^2$ operators that can feature in the worldline action.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, based on the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, we highlight the fundamental role of the holographic central charge in connecting the boundary theory to quantum information, black hole thermodynamics, and the nature of gravity in the bulk. We establish that the large central charge of the boundary conformal field theory corresponds to classical gravity, while a small central charge corresponds to quantum gravity described by Loop Quantum Gravity. In addition, we study the thermodynamic behavior of AdS-Schwarzschild black holes for both large and small central charges. For large central charge, the classical AdS-Schwarzschild black holes have two phases: unstable small black holes and stable large black holes. Conversely, for small central charge, black holes are stable, and their entropy is smaller than that of classical black holes. To explore the influence of the boundary central charge on the information loss paradox, we use the island formula to recover the Page curve. We find that before the Page time, the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation increases with time, and its slope is determined by the central charge of the boundary theory. After the Page time, the island inside black holes emerges, and the unitarity of black hole evaporation is restored, yielding a constant entropy consistent with the Page curve. This entanglement entropy, i.e. after the Page time, depends on the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and includes a logarithmic correction related to the central charge.

 These lecture notes are a contribution to the proceedings of the school "Geometric, Algebraic and Topological Methods for Quantum Field Theory", held in Villa de Leyva, Colombia, from 31st of July to 9th of August 2023. Its intention is to put together several basic tools of classical integrability and contrast them with those available in the formulation of asymptotic symmetries and the definition of canonical charges in gauge theories. We consider as a working example the Chern-Simons theory in 3D dimensions, motivated by its various applications in condensed matter physics, gravity, and black hole physics. We review basic aspects of the canonical formulation, symplectic geometry, Liouville integrability, and Lax Pairs. We define the Hamiltonian formulation of the Chern-Simons action and the canonical generators of the gauge symmetries, which are surface integrals that subject to non-trivial boundary conditions, realize transformations that do change the physical state, namely large (or improper gauge transformations). We propose asymptotic conditions that realize an infinite set of abelian conserved charges associated with integral models. We review two different cases: the Korteweg-de Vries equation for its connection with the Virasoro algebra and fluid dynamics, and the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy, as it embeds an infinite class of non-linear notable integrable evolution equations. We propose a concrete example for gravity in 3D with $\Lambda<0$, where we find a near-horizon asymptotic dynamics. We finalize offering some insights on the initial value problem, its connection with integrable systems and flat connections. We study some properties of the Monodromy matrix and recover the infinite KdV charges from the trace invariants extracted from the Monodromy evolution equation that can be written in a Lax form.

 - **Abstract**
 The thermofield double state entangles two copies of a CFT via a sum over energy eigenstates and is dual to the two-sided eternal black hole. We explore an analogous construction using sums over gauge group representations of half-BPS Wilson loops in multiple copies of $U(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. These sums act as delta function-like operators that correlate the eigenvalues of the corresponding half-BPS matrix models. We suggest that the holographic duals are ''bubbling wormhole'' geometries: multi-covers of AdS$_5$ $\times S^5$ whose conformal boundary consists of multiple four-spheres intersecting on a common circle. We analyze the matrix model free energy, discuss its bulk interpretation, and study probe loops in these backgrounds.
