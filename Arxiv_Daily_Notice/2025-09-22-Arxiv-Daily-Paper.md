#### Kinematics of Stellar Streams from Globular Clusters Depend on Black Hole Retention and Star Mass: A Selection Effect for Dark Matter Inference

 - **Abstract**
 Velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) in stellar streams from globular clusters (GCs) is sensitive to heating by Galactic substructure, including dark matter (DM) subhalos. Recent studies have compared $\sigma$ in observed and modeled streams to probe DM properties, but have relied on stream models that neglect strong encounters, black holes (BHs), and mass segregation in GCs. Such phenomena may inflate stream $\sigma$ or introduce selection effects -- e.g., a $\sigma$ that depends on star mass ($m$). We investigate this prospect using Monte Carlo $N$-body simulations of GCs under static Galactic tides to generate mock streams with realistic mass and velocity distributions. We find $\sigma$ correlates with $m$, especially after core collapse (the GC's observable increase in central density upon ejecting its BHs), rising from $1.2$--$2.2\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$ between $m=0.3$--$0.8\,M_\odot$, with typical kinematic cuts on stream membership. Similar in magnitude to heating by Galactic substructure, this enhancement occurs because the GC's loss of BHs allows its most-massive stars to occupy its dense center, raising their likelihood of strong ejection via binary interactions and adding broad, exponential wings to the stream's velocity distribution. Streams' kinematics thus probe properties (density, BH retention) of their progenitor GCs. Our results also imply observations of streams from some GCs, especially those not subject to highly episodic mass loss, may select for higher $\sigma$ than predicted by models neglecting $\sigma$'s $m$-dependence. This would cause observed $\sigma$ in streams -- already on the low side of expectations for cold DM -- to further favor alternatives such as warm, ultralight, or self-interacting DM.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform an analysis of the full shapes of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest correlation functions measured from the first data release (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our analysis focuses on measuring the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the cosmic growth rate times the amplitude of matter fluctuations in spheres of $8$ $h^{-1}\text{Mpc}$, $f\sigma_8$. We validate our measurements using two different sets of mocks, a series of data splits, and a large set of analysis variations, which were first performed blinded. Our analysis constrains the ratio $D_M/D_H(z_\mathrm{eff})=4.525\pm0.071$, where $D_H=c/H(z)$ is the Hubble distance, $D_M$ is the transverse comoving distance, and the effective redshift is $z_\mathrm{eff}=2.33$. This is a factor of $2.4$ tighter than the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) constraint from the same data. When combining with Ly$\alpha$ BAO constraints from DESI DR2, we obtain the ratios $D_H(z_\mathrm{eff})/r_d=8.646\pm0.077$ and $D_M(z_\mathrm{eff})/r_d=38.90\pm0.38$, where $r_d$ is the sound horizon at the drag epoch. We also measure $f\sigma_8(z_\mathrm{eff}) = 0.37\; ^{+0.055}_{-0.065} \,(\mathrm{stat})\, \pm 0.033 \,(\mathrm{sys})$, but we do not use it for cosmological inference due to difficulties in its validation with mocks. In $\Lambda$CDM, our measurements are consistent with both cosmic microwave background (CMB) and galaxy clustering constraints. Using a nucleosynthesis prior but no CMB anisotropy information, we measure the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = 68.3\pm 1.6\;\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ within $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we show that Ly$\alpha$ forest AP measurements can help improve constraints on the dark energy equation of state, and are expected to play an important role in upcoming DESI analyses.

#### Dynamical Analysis of the HD 169142 Planet-Forming Disk: Twelve Years of High-Contrast Polarimetry

 - **Abstract**
 We present a dynamical analysis of the HD 169142 planet-forming disk based on high-contrast polarimetric imaging over a twelve-year observational period, offering insights into its disk evolution and planet-disk interactions. This study explores the evolution of scattered-light features and their relationship with millimeter continuum emission. Archival visible-to-near-infrared scattered-light observations from NACO, SPHERE, and GPI combined with new observations from SCExAO reveal persistent non-axisymmetric structures in both the inner and outer rings of the disk. Through Keplerian image transformations and phase cross-correlation techniques, we show that the azimuthal brightness variations in the inner ring follow the local Keplerian velocity, suggesting these are intrinsic disk features rather than planet-induced spirals or shadows. The motion of the outer ring is weakly detected, requiring a longer observational baseline for further confirmation. Comparing scattered-light features with ALMA 1.3 mm-continuum data, we find that the scattered light traces the edges of dust structures in the inner ring, indicating complex interactions and a leaky dust trap around the water-ice snowline. These findings highlight the capability of long-term monitoring of circumstellar disks to distinguish planetary influences from Keplerian disk dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of three new low-latitude (|b| ~ 20$^{\circ}$) Milky Way satellites: Yasone-1, Yasone-2, and Yasone-3. They were identified in our search for compact stellar overdensities in the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1, supported by follow-up deep photometric imaging from the Gran Telescopio Canarias OSIRIS instrument and Gaia astrometric data. These three new Milky Way satellites are found as compact stellar overdensities that exhibit structural and photometric properties consistent with old, metal-poor populations. All three are best described by isochrone fits corresponding to an age of ~12 Gyr and subsolar metallicities: [Fe/H] ~ -1.5 for Yasone-1 and Yasone-2, and [Fe/H] ~ -2.0 for Yasone-3. Yasone-1, located at a heliocentric distance of 12 kpc, has a physical half-light radius of 1.40 pc, an absolute V-band magnitude of +2.36, and a total stellar mass of 18.2 M$_{\odot}$. Yasone-2, at a distance of 20 kpc, has a slightly larger size of 2.44 pc, a brighter V-band magnitude of +1.83, and a higher mass of 28.0 M$_{\odot}$. Yasone-3, located at 15 kpc, is the faintest and least massive of the three, with M$_{V}$ = +2.52, a stellar mass of 14.4 M$_{\odot}$, and a half-light radius of 2.09 pc. We also report a fourth (Yasone-4), lower-confidence hypercompact candidate located at Galactic latitude (b ~ 48$^{\circ}$), identified by replicating our search using the photometric catalogue of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Public Release. Finally, we present the discovery of sixteen (Yasone-5 to Yasone-20) new hypercompact cluster candidates in the Galactic disc. We discuss the possibility that any of the Yasone clusters may host an intermediate-mass black hole, and we advocate for follow-up spectroscopic observations to further constrain their nature.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a review of our findings on the origin, drivers, nature, and impact of kiloparsec-scale radio emission in radio-quiet (RQ) AGN. Using radio polarimetric techniques, we probe the dynamics and magnetic (B-) field geometry of outflows in Seyfert and LINER galaxies. Multi-band data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) reveal how low-power jets interact with their environment. These interactions can slow down and disrupt the radio outflows while locally regulating star formation through AGN feedback. Several radio properties correlate strongly with the black hole mass, similar to trends observed in radio-loud (RL) AGN. Although their characteristics differ, RQ systems might not be intrinsically distinct from RL AGN, apart from lower jet powers. Our polarization measurements further suggest a composite model in which a black hole-accretion disk system drives both a collimated jet with a small-pitch-angle helical B-field and a wide-angle wind threaded by a high-pitch-angle helical field.

 - **Abstract**
 The standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm of the physical Universe suffers from well-known conceptual problems and is challenged by observational data. Alternative models exist in the literature, both phenomenological and physically motivated, many of them suffering from similar or new problems. We propose a method to mechanically generate alternative models in a procedure informed by data and tuned to mitigate specific problems. We implement a computational framework, dubbed CosmoGen, that integrates evolutionary algorithms for symbolic regression, with computation of structure formation and background cosmological quantities that are used to guide the evolutionary process. As a proof-of-concept we apply the procedure to the specific case of dark energy fluid models, and ask the framework to generate models capable of alleviating the cosmological tensions $S_8$ and $H_0$. The system generates models with high fitness values, and through a Bayesian analysis of an illustrative model, we show that the model indeed alleviates the tensions.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive models of rotating very massive stellar cores with mass $\approx 10^2$--$10^4M_\odot$ which are marginally stable to the pair-unstable collapse, assuming that the core is isentropic and composed primarily of oxygen. It is shown that the cores with mass $\lesssim 10^3M_\odot$ can form a massive disk with the mass more than 10% of the core mass around the formed black hole if the core is rotating with more than 30% of the Keplerian limit. We also indicate that the formation of rapidly spinning massive black holes such as the black holes of GW231123 naturally accompanies the massive disk formation. By using the result of our previous study which showed that the massive disk is unstable to the non-axisymmetric deformation, we predict the amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves and show that the collapse of rotating very massive stellar cores can be a promising source of gravitational waves for Einstein Telescope. The detection of such gravitational waves will provide us with important information about a formation process of intermediate mass black holes.

#### Evidence for Three Subpopulations of Merging Binary Black Holes at Different Primary Masses

 - **Abstract**
 With the release of the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA gravitational-wave catalog (GWTC-4), we are starting to gain a detailed view of the population of merging binary black holes. The formation channels of these black holes is not clearly understood, but different formation mechanisms may lead to subpopulations with different properties visible in gravitational-wave data. Adopting a phenomenological approach, we find GWTC-4 data supports the presence of at least three subpopulations, each associated with a different range of black hole mass and with sharp transition boundaries between them. Each subpopulation is characterized by different distributions for either the mass ratios, the black-hole spin magnitudes or both. Subpopulation A with primary mass $m_1 \leq 27.7^{+4.1}_{-3.4} M_{\odot}$ ($90 \%$ credibility), is characterized by a nearly flat mass ratio distribution $q=m_2/m_1$, and by small spin magnitudes ($\chi \leq 0.5^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$). Subpopulation B with $27.7^{+4.1}_{-3.4} M_{\odot} \leq m_1 \leq 40.2^{+4.7}_{-3.2} M_{\odot}$, has a much sharper preference for mass ratio $q \approx 1$. Subpopulation C, with $m_1 \geq 40.2^{+4.7}_{-3.2} M_{\odot}$, has support for large spin magnitudes, and tentative support for mass ratios $q\approx0.5$. We interpret these transitions as evidence for multiple subpopulations, each potentially associated with a different formation pathways. We suggest potential formation scenarios for each subpopulations, and suggest that Subpopulation B may be associated with chemically homogeneous evolution or population III stars. Our findings for Subpopulation C are largely consistent with recent claims of hierarchical mergers, but with some curious differences in properties.

 - **Abstract**
 The product of a compact star merger is usually hypothesized to be a hyperaccreting black hole, typically resulting in a gamma-ray burst (GRB) with a duration shorter than 2~s. However, recent observations of GRB~211211A and GRB~230307A, both arising from compact star mergers, challenge this model due to their minute-long durations. The data from both events are consistent with having a nascent, rapidly spinning highly magnetized neutron star (a millisecond magnetar) as the merger product and GRB engine, but a smoking gun signature is still missing. Here we report strong but not yet conclusive evidence for the detection of a 909-Hz gamma-ray periodic signal during a brief time window of GRB~230307A, which is consistent with the rotation frequency of such a millisecond magnetar. Notably, the periodic signal appeared for only 160~ms at an epoch coinciding with the transition epoch when the jet emission from the GRB central engine ceased and when the delayed emission from high latitudes started. If this signal is real, the temporal and spectral features of this gamma-ray periodicity can be consistently interpreted as asymmetric mini-jet emission from a dissipating Poynting-flux-dominated jet, as revealed by the energy-dependent light curve data of this burst.

#### Observation of the Galactic Center in the Sub-MeV Gamma-Ray Band with an Electron-Tracking Compton Camera

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first detection of gamma-ray emission from the Galactic center in the 150-600 keV band using a linear, imaging-spectroscopy approach used in common telescopes with an electron-tracking Compton camera (ETCC) aboard the SMILE-2+ balloon experiment. A one-day flight over Australia resulted in a significant gamma-ray detection in the light curve and revealed a $7.9\sigma$ excess in the image map from the Galactic center region. These results, obtained through a simple and unambiguous analysis, demonstrate the high reliability and sensitivity of the ETCC and establish its potential for future high-precision MeV gamma-ray observations. The measured intensity and spatial distribution were tested against three emission models: a single point-like source, a multi-component structure, and a symmetric two-dimensional Gaussian. All models were found to be statistically consistent with the data. The positronium-related flux in the multi-component model is $(3.2~\pm~1.4)~\times~10^{-2}$ photons cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, which is approximately a factor of two higher than the value reported by INTEGRAL, with a discrepancy at the $2\sigma$ level. This difference may arise from unresolved sources or truly diffuse emission, such as exotic processes involving light dark matter or primordial black holes.

#### Why Do We See So Few Black Holes in Massive Binaries?

 - **Abstract**
 We offer a simple explanation for the small number of black holes observed in pairs with massive stars. In detached massive binaries, spherically symmetric accretion takes place. This accretion could result in effective energy release in the hard band only if the equipartition of the gravitational and magnetic energy of plasma is established (Shvartsmans theorem). However, we show that due to the magnetic exhaust effect this equilibrium is virtually never established for the actual magnetic fields observed on massive stars: Shvartsmans theorem does not work. As a result, it is virtually impossible to detect black holes in detached massive binaries by currently available means (mainly, through X-ray observations).

 - **Abstract**
 We present a new method to search for strong gravitational lensing systems by pairing spectra that are close together on the sky in a spectroscopic survey. We visually inspect 26,621 spectra in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 that are selected in this way. We further inspect the 11,848 images corresponding to these spectra in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10, and obtain 2046 conventional strong gravitational lens candidates, of which 1906 are new. This constitutes the largest sample of lens candidates identified to date in spectroscopic data. Besides the conventional candidates, we identify a new class of systems that we term "dimple lenses". These systems have a low-mass foreground galaxy as a lens, typically smaller in angular extent and fainter compared with the lensed background source galaxy, producing subtle surface brightness indentations in the latter. We report the discovery of 318 of these "dimple-lens" candidates. We suspect that these represent dwarf galaxy lensing. With follow-up observations, they could offer a new avenue to test the cold dark matter model by probing their mass profiles, stellar mass-halo mass relation, and halo mass function for $M_{\textrm{Halo}} \lesssim 10^{13}\,M_\odot$. Thus, in total, we report 2164 new lens candidates. Our method demonstrates the power of pairwise spectroscopic analysis and provides a pathway complementary to imaging-based and single-spectrum lens searches.

#### Unified dark fluid with null sound speed as an alternative to phantom dark energy

 - **Abstract**
 Recent BAO measurements from DESI, when combined with CMB and supernovae data, suggest evolving dark energy and in particular point to a possible phantom regime, with an equation of state parameter $w<-1$. We explore an alternative phenomenological way to model dark matter and dark energy based on a unified dark fluid (UDF). By construction, our model reproduces the same background expansion history as DESI's best-fit using the CPL parametrization, but assumes a vanishing rest-frame sound speed and no anisotropic stress. This simple prescription ensures a consistent and physical treatment of perturbations, and the use of a unified dark sector avoids phantom behaviour by construction. We model CMB, LSS, and redshift-space distortion observables, and find differences with CPL that are typically at the few-percent level. As a result, we forecast that even stage IV CMB and galaxy surveys will have limited power to discriminate between our UDF and CPL at the linear level. At the non-linear level, we study spherical collapse in the UDF and show that within this framework, structure formation proceeds very similarly to standard scenarios. Using Planck, DESI BAO DR2, and DESY5 supernovae data, we demonstrate that this simple UDF model fits current observations nearly as well as CPL, while treating perturbations consistently. Because most cosmological observations are not sensitive to how the dark sector is split, the unified framework can also approximate the phenomenology of interacting dark energy-dark matter scenarios or evolving dark matter, making it a general way to model the data, at least as long as the dark components have a vanishing sound speed, which is the most distinctive feature of our analysis. This highlights that a unified dark fluid with evolving equation of state and null sound speed is sufficient to pass current constraints without a phantom component.

#### Cosmographic Footprints of Dynamical Dark Energy

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce a novel cosmographic framework to trace the late-time kinematics of the Universe without assuming any underlying dynamics. The method relies on generalized Padé-$(2,1)$ expansions around arbitrary pivot redshifts, which, compared to state-of-the-art calculations, reduce truncation errors by up to two orders of magnitude at high redshift and yield more precise constraints by defining cosmographic parameters exactly where the data lie. This avoids extrapolations, mitigates degeneracies, and enables a clean disentangling of their effects. Using the latest low-redshift datasets, we center the generalized expansion in multiple bins across $z\in[0,1]$ and obtain precise constraints on the redshift evolution of cosmographic parameters. We find that all key parameters deviate from their $\Lambda$CDM predictions in a redshift-dependent way that can be naturally explained within dynamical Dark Energy scenarios. The deceleration parameter $q(z)$ follows a redshift evolution consistent with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization, while the generalized $Om(z)$ diagnostic shows deviations of up to $\sim4\sigma$ from the constant $\Lambda$CDM expectation, closely matching the CPL predictions. Taken together, these results point to footprints of dynamical Dark Energy in the kinematics of the Universe at $z\lesssim 1$.

#### Sound-Horizon-Agnostic Inference of the Hubble Constant and Neutrino Mass from BAO, CMB Lensing, and Galaxy Weak Lensing and Clustering

 - **Abstract**
 We present a sound-horizon-agnostic determination of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, by combining DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data with the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing measurements from Planck, ACT, and SPT-3G, the angular size of the CMB acoustic scale, Dark Energy Survey Year-3 ($3\times2$-pt) galaxy weak lensing and clustering correlations, and the Pantheon+ supernova sample. In this analysis, the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, is treated as a free parameter, avoiding assumptions about early-Universe physics. By combining uncalibrated comoving distances from BAO and supernovae with constraints on the matter density $\Omega_m h^2$ from CMB and galaxy lensing/clustering, we break the $r_d$-$H_0$ degeneracy and obtain $H_0 = 70.0 \pm 1.7$ km/s/Mpc when the sum of the neutrino masses is fixed at $\Sigma m_\nu = 0.06$ eV. With a conservative prior on the amplitude of primordial fluctuations, $A_s$, we find $H_0 = 70.03 \pm 0.97$ km/s/Mpc and $r_d = 144.8 \pm 1.6$ Mpc. Allowing $\Sigma m_\nu$ to vary yields $H_0 = 75.3^{+3.3}_{-4.0}$ km/s/Mpc and $\Sigma m_\nu = 0.55^{+0.23}_{-0.37}$ ($<1.11$ eV) at 68% (95%) CL, and $H_0 = 73.9 \pm 2.2$ km/s/Mpc with $\Sigma m_\nu = 0.46^{+0.21}_{-0.25}$ ($=0.46^{+0.40}_{-0.45}$ eV) at 68% (95%) CL when a prior on $A_s$ is applied. Forecasts for the completed DESI BAO program, combined with Simons-Observatory-like CMB lensing, next-generation $3\times2$-pt data, and expanded supernova samples predict $\sigma(H_0) \simeq 0.67$ km/s/Mpc with fixed $\Sigma m_\nu$, and $\sigma(H_0) \simeq 1.1$ km/s/Mpc with $\Sigma m_\nu < 0.133$ ($<0.263$) eV at 68% (95%) CL when the neutrino mass is varied. As the precision of BAO, CMB lensing, and galaxy lensing/clustering improve, this $r_d$-agnostic framework will provide an independent test of the need for new physics at recombination.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we tested the physical properties of Rastall black holes in the presence of string clouds and quintessence. The modified spacetime geometry arising from the Rastall framework is first established, providing the basis for analyzing the geodesic structure. We study null geodesics in detail, testing photon trajectories, the conditions for photon spheres, BH shadows, the associated effective radial force, and the topological features of photon rings. Also, the analysis is further tested to timelike geodesics, where we investigate the motion of massive particles and determine the innermost stable circular orbits. In this case, we discuss the thermodynamic behavior of the system, show the effects of Rastall gravity, strings, and quintessence on the BHs stability and thermal characteristics. In this context, our results improve and show of how modifications to general relativity and surrounding matter distributions influence both the dynamical and thermodynamical aspects of BHs.

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce novel black hole (BH) solutions, charge/non-charge, within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, a theory that does not inherently include a cosmological constant, using equal/diffirent metric ansatzs. Remarkably, these solutions exhibit asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) or de Sitter (dS) behavior, depending on their parameter values. Unlike the BTZ solutions of General Relativity, which feature a causal singularity and constant scalar invariants, our solutions display strong spacetime singularities, as shown by their scalar invariants. We construct $f(R)$ functions that behave as polynomial functions, emphasizing the unique nature of these solutions. We demonstrate the stability of these solutions in two ways: first, by showing that their heat capacity is positive, which ensures thermodynamic stability; and second, by proving that the second derivative of $f(R)$ is positive, meeting the Ostrogradski criterion for dynamical stability. Furthermore, the solutions satisfy the first law of thermodynamics, confirming their consistency with fundamental thermodynamic principles.

 - **Abstract**
 Regular black holes and horizonless black-hole mimickers offer mathematically consistent alternatives to address the challenges posed by standard black holes. However, the formation mechanism of these alternative objects is still largely unclear and constitutes a significant open problem since understanding their dynamical formation represents a first step to assess their existence. We here investigate, for the first time and without invoking deviations from general relativity, the dynamical formation of a well-known horizonless black-hole mimicker, namely, a gravastar. More specifically, starting from the collapse of a uniform dust sphere as in the case of the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse, we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, a gravastar can form from the nucleation and expansion of a de-Sitter region with initial zero size at the center of the collapsing sphere. Furthermore, the de-Sitter expansion naturally slows down near the Schwarzschild radius, where it meets the collapsing dust surface and gives rise to a static equilibrium. Interestingly, we also find a maximum initial compactness of the collapsing star of $\mathcal{C}= 3/8$, above which the collapse to a black hole is inevitable.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze a theory with non-minimal matter-curvature coupling, considering non-metricity properties with a Weyl connection. This model has the advantage of an extra force term which can mimic dark matter and dark energy, and simultaneously follow Weyl's idea to unify gravity and electromagnetism. Indeed, Schwarzschild-like and Reissner-Nordstrom-like black hole solutions exist in this model, leading to new features, such as an additional horizon, due to the non-metricity vector. We derive the cosmological field equations, considering a minimal coupling, and discuss preliminary results on the scalar cosmological perturbations in this model.

 - **Abstract**
 The divergence of curvature invariants at a given point signals the incompleteness of the spacetime, and the derivative order of these diverging invariants determines the differentiability class of the considered spacetime. We hereby focus on a general static and spherically symmetric geometry and determine, in the full non-linear regime and in a model independent way, the conditions that the metric functions must satisfy in order to achieve regularity at the origin. This work is structured around a central theorem, which relates the regularity of the spacetime at the origin to the parity of the metric functions. The detailed proof of this theorem constitutes the main result of the paper.

 - **Abstract**
 Regular black holes (BHs) which are singularity-free alternatives to the standard black hole paradigm in General Relativity (GR), offer effective models for probing the interface between classical and quantum gravity. They serve as promising candidates for exploring the nature of strong gravity and potential extensions of GR by providing testing grounds to understand how quantum corrections might manifest in astrophysical black holes. In the present work, we investigate the regular BH scenario described by the Simpson-Visser (SV) spacetime and explore its imprints on the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed in the black hole power spectrum. The Simpson-Visser spacetime represent the simplest, globally regular extensions of the Schwarzschild scenario, through the presence of a regularizing parameter. We explore the imprints of the regularizing parameter on the orbital and epicyclic frequencies associated with the motion of test particles in the rotating SV spacetime. Models aimed to explain the observed HFQPOs often invoke these fundamental frequencies and hence can potentially constrain the regularizing parameter from the available HFQPO data. We test eleven well-established HFQPO models against available observations from six black hole sources, obtaining spin constraints that, when compared with previous independent estimates, help identify the observationally favored models for each source. Based on the present data, we report that the observationally favored models cannot discriminate between the Kerr and the Simpson-Visser scenario. This when coupled with the large discrepancy in previous spin estimates of these sources, may plausibly indicate some deviation from GR in the strong gravity regime near BHs which requires further investigation.

 - **Abstract**
 Some aspects of two General Relativistic cosmological solutions, an exact $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmological solution $j=1$ ($j$ is cosmographic jerk parameter), and a specifically designed toy cosmological solution $j=1+3\varepsilon(q-1/2)$ ($q$ is cosmographic deceleration parameter, $0<|\varepsilon|<1$) that is capable of accommodating a phantom crossing scenario as suggested by DESI DR2, are studied within the context of $f(R)$ gravity, by portraying them as a \emph{flow} in the 2-dimensional \emph{theory space} spanned by the quantities $r=\frac{R f'}{f}, m=\frac{R f''}{f'}$. For the $f(R)$ theories exactly reproducing a background $\Lambda$CDM-like expansion history $j=1$, it is shown by means of a \emph{cosmographic} reconstruction approach that the curvature degree of freedom need not necessarily behave like an effective cosmological constant, and that cosmologies under different possible such theories lead to different possible values of $\Omega_{m0}$. With the theory space analysis, it is also shown that $\Lambda$CDM-mimicking $f(R)$ cosmologies that asymptote to General Relativistic $\Lambda$CDM in the limit $q\to1/2$, are prone to instability under small homogeneous and isotropic perturbation, casting a doubt on achieving an exact $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmological solution $j=1$ within $f(R)$ gravity. Regarding the toy cosmological solution $j=1+3\varepsilon(q-1/2)$ that is capable of accommodating a phantom crossing scenario, it is shown that possible underlying $f(R)$ theories that admit it as a solution are inevitably plagued by tachyonic instability ($f''(R)<0$). All the above physically interesting conclusions are derived without explicitly reconstructing, even numerically, the functional form of the underlying $f(R)$, which demonstrates the edge of the $r$-$m$ theory space analysis over the traditional explicit reconstruction approach.

 - **Abstract**
 The Weyl geometric gravity theory, in which the gravitational action is constructed from the square of the Weyl curvature scalar and the strength of the Weyl vector, has been intensively investigated recently. The theory admits a scalar-vector-tensor representation, obtained by introducing an auxiliary scalar field, and can therefore be reformulated as a scalar-vector-tensor theory in a Riemann space, in the presence of a nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field. By assuming that the Weyl vector has only a radial component, an exact spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the field equations can be obtained, which depends on three integration constants. As compared to the Schwarzschild solution, the Weyl geometric gravity solution contains two new terms, linear and quadratic in the radial coordinate, respectively. In the present work we consider the possibility of testing and obtaining observational restrictions on the Weyl geometric gravity black hole at the scale of the Solar System, by considering six classical tests of general relativity (gravitational redshift, the Eötvös parameter and the universality of free fall, the Nortvedt effect, the planetary perihelion precession, the deflection of light by a compact object, and the radar echo delay effect, respectively) for the exact spherically symmetric black hole solution of the Weyl geometric gravity. All these gravitational effects can be fully explained and are consistent with the vacuum solution of the Weyl geometric gravity. Moreover, the study of the classical general relativistic tests also allows to constrain the free parameter of the solution.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the quasinormal mode spectrum and grey-body factors of black holes in an effectively quantum-corrected spacetime, focusing on the influence of near-horizon modifications on observable quantities. Employing scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac test fields, we analyze the perturbation equations and extract the fundamental quasinormal frequencies using both the 6th-order WKB method with Padé resummation and time-domain integration. Our results show that quantum corrections near the horizon significantly affect the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes, particularly for low multipole numbers and in the near-extremal regime. We also verify the robustness of the correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors by comparing WKB results with those reconstructed from the dominant quasinormal modes. Across all field types and parameter ranges considered, the WKB method proves accurate within a few percent, confirming its reliability in probing the impact of near-horizon physics. These findings support the use of quasinormal ringing and Hawking radiation spectra as sensitive tools for testing quantum modifications of black hole spacetimes.

 - **Abstract**
 We study grey-body factors of neutral scalar and Dirac fields in the background of charged black holes arising in the Einstein--Euler--Heisenberg (EEH) theory. The Euler--Heisenberg corrections, which represent nonlinear electrodynamical effects due to vacuum polarization, modify the effective potential barrier surrounding the black hole and thereby affect the transmission probabilities for Hawking quanta. Using the sixth-order WKB method, and verifying our results against the recently proposed correspondence between grey-body factors and quasinormal modes, we compute the frequency-dependent grey-body spectra for various values of the black hole charge and EEH coupling. We find that the nonlinear coupling systematically lowers the effective potential barrier, enhancing the transmission probability. This work represents the first step toward incorporating nonlinear QED effects into the study of Hawking evaporation, focusing here on neutral test fields.

 - **Abstract**
 Lin, Maldacena, Rozenberg, and Shan (LMRS) presented a new information paradox in black hole physics by noticing that the entanglement and Rényi entropies in a two-sided black hole can become negative when the geometry contains a very large number of matter excitations behind the black hole horizon. While originally this puzzle was presented in the context of BPS two-sided black holes in two-dimensional supergravity, the negativity in fact persists for more general two-sided black holes in the presence of a large number of matter excitations. Since the entanglement and Rényi entropies in ordinary quantum systems cannot be negative, resolving this puzzle is a necessary step towards understanding the quantum mechanical description of black holes. In this paper, we explain how to address the entanglement negativity puzzle, both in the original setting discussed by LMRS and in more general non-supersymmetric settings, by summing over all non-perturbative contributions to the gravitational path integral. We then interpret this result from the point of view of a dual matrix integral, which we use to extend our analysis beyond the regime of validity of the genus re-summation performed in the gravitational path integral. In this regime, positivity is rescued by new saddles of the matrix integral, a one-eigenvalue instanton and a two-eigenvalue instanton. Finally, we formulate a similar puzzle and its resolution using random tensor network techniques.
