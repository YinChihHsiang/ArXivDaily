 - **Abstract**
 "Little red dots" (LRDs) represent a new population of astronomical objects uncovered by JWST whose nature remains debated. Although many LRDs are suspected as active galactic nuclei (AGN), they show little variability on days-years timescales. We report the discovery of two gravitationally lensed LRDs at redshift $\sim$4.3 behind the cluster RXCJ2211-0350, one of which (RX1) is quadruply imaged with time delays spanning $\sim$130 years. RX1 exhibits intrinsic color and brightness variations of up to 0.7 magnitude among its images. These changes are consistent with blackbody-temperature variations of a photosphere, indicating long-term variability analogous to Cepheid-like pulsations but in a far more extended ($R \sim 2000$ AU) and massive ($M \gtrsim 10^6 \, M_{\odot}$) systems. These results suggest LRDs as a distinct class of AGN with stellar-like envelopes.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs), their spin and abundance, in a single-field inflationary model based on a mutated hilltop potential inserted with a small step-like feature. This step induces a brief phase of ultra-slow-roll inflation, producing the large enhancement of the scalar power spectrum required for an appreciable amount of PBH abundance. Instead of the commonly used analytical power spectra, we compute the primordial power spectrum accurately by numerically solving the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation. Using the obtained power spectrum, we apply peak theory with $\nabla^2 \zeta$ treated as a Gaussian random field and parametrize the curvature profile by its amplitude $\mu$ and characteristic width $K$. Confining the study to Type-I PBH, the threshold value is calculated using two robust methods: the average of the compaction function and the q-function method. Using the result, the dimensionless spin parameter of the resulting PBHs is calculated at linear order and found to be $\sqrt{\langle a_\star^2 \rangle} \sim 10^{-3}$; however, it can be higher for smaller masses. We present detailed predictions for two representative parameter sets, calculate the present-day PBH mass function $f_{\rm PBH}(M)$ and the associated scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). The first produces PBHs of mass $M \simeq 10^{-13}\,M_\odot$ that can account for $100\%$ of dark matter, while the second yields $M \simeq 10^{-2}\,M_\odot$ PBHs contributing approximately $2.4\%$ of the dark matter density. The predicted signals of SIGWs lie within the sensitivity bands of future experiments such as LISA, DECIGO, BBO, and SKA. In particular, the second parameter set produces a SIGWs compatible with the recent NANOGrav evidence for a low-frequency gravitational-wave signal.

#### Evolution of the Inner Accretion Flow in Swift J1727.8$-$1613 across Intermediate States: Insights from Broadband Spectral and Timing Analysis

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive broadband spectral and variability study of the newly detected black hole X-ray binary Swift~J1727.8--1613 in the intermediate states during its 2023 outburst, using multi-mission observations from NICER, NuSTAR, AstroSat, and Insight-HXMT. The spectral data up to $78$ keV in the hard-intermediate state (HIMS) requires models with two Comptonizing regions. In contrast, models with a single Comptonizing region adequately describe the soft-intermediate states (SIMS), implying a significant evolution in the disk-corona geometry between the states. The hard X-ray tail above $100$ keV in the HIMS, detected with both AstroSat/CZTI and Insight-HXMT/HE, indicates that the electron population in the corona is not purely thermal but rather hybrid, with a power-law distribution above the thermal cutoff. While both the reflection modeling and disk continuum fitting favor a truncated disk geometry in the HIMS, the disk substantially moves close to the innermost stable circular orbit in the SIMS, accompanied by a significant rise in the disk temperature. This interpretation is further supported by the increase in the QPO frequency from $\sim1.3$ to $\sim6.6$ Hz. From joint modeling of the disk continuum and reflection component, we estimate a black hole mass of $10.5^{+7.7}_{-3.0}$, spin of $0.79^{+0.03}_{-0.13}$, and disk inclination angle of $42^\circ$-$50^\circ$, which match well with the previously reported spectro-polarimetric measurements. The inferred source distance of $\sim3.5$ kpc is consistent with the recent estimate based on optical spectroscopy. We find a weakly variable or stable disk and a highly variable Comptonized component.

 - **Abstract**
 Using late-Universe observations, we demonstrate that freeing dark energy and dark matter equations of state (EoS) dramatically alters the inferred strength and direction of their interactions. When dark sector EoS are fixed to $w_{\mathrm{de}}=-1$ and $w_{\mathrm{dm}}=0$, the data consistently favor an energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter across various interaction forms. This apparent evidence, however, proves highly sensitive to the EoS assumptions: treating $w_{\mathrm{de}}$ as a free parameter substantially weakens the evidence for interaction, with its value converging to the quintessence regime ($w_{\mathrm{de}}>-1$). In contrast, freeing $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ maintains a preference for interaction, revealing a correlation where positive $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ is associated with energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter, and negative $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ with energy transfer from dark matter to dark energy. These findings caution against the simplistic assumption of $\Lambda$CDM EoS values when attempting to detect a possible interaction. Despite these fundamental degeneracies, model comparison using the Akaike and Deviance information criteria shows that all of the tested interacting dark energy scenarios receive substantial support over the $\Lambda$CDM model.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we test a framework to perform the analysis of redshift-space distortions simultaneously in configuration and Fourier space. We test our methods with the AbacusSummit suite of N-body simulations as well as a more numerous set of approximate EZmocks, reproducing the sample of luminous red galaxies of from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) and its extension (eBOSS). Our clustering models are based on the effective field theory of large-scale structures in a Lagrangian frame, used in the latest results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. We perform a template type of analysis, including dilation parameters and the slope parameter from the ShapeFit framework. We find that the joint space inference yields unbiased and robust constraints on simulated datasets, consistent with results from individual spaces or previous methods to obtain consensus results. Our joint space analysis on the the BOSS+eBOSS LRG sample obtains $ f\sigma_8 = 0.463 \pm 0.052 $, in good agreement with the official 2020 results.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar feedback, as a key process regulating the baryon cycle, is thought to greatly redistribute baryonic material inside and outside the dark matter halos (DMHs), however the observational evidences are lacking. Through stacking analyses of ~400,000 galaxy spectra from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we find star formation driven cool outflows in Mg II absorption line. Assuming only gravity acts on the launched gas, our calculations reveal that outflows from low mass galaxies (log M*<10) are capable of escaping beyond the DMHs, which aligns well with our finding in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) absorption along the minor-axes of galaxies using background quasars. This research offers indirect evidence that stellar feedback drives the low baryon retention rate in low-mass haloes, implicating that baryonic processes within galaxies are connected with the diffuse matter beyond the DMHs.

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the idea of using quasars as standardizable candles for cosmology, we examine the relation between X-ray (at 2 keV, $L_{\rm 2keV}$) and ultraviolet (at 2500 Angstrom, $L_{\rm 2500}$) monochromatic luminosities of quasars using a sample of 2414 X-ray sources from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey cross-matched with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 16 quasar catalogue (SDSS DR16Q), at redshifts between 0.5 and 2.5. These objects are bright both in X-rays and in the optical, so that the sample is characterized by nearly 100% statistical completeness. We have developed a new method for determining the $L_{\rm 2keV}-L_{\rm 2500}$ relation, which consistently takes into account (i) X-ray and UV flux limited object selection, (ii) X-ray and UV variability of quasars, and (iii) the decreasing space density of quasars with increasing luminosity. Assuming a linear relation between $l_{\rm X}\equiv\log(L_{\rm 2keV}/[{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}])$ and $l_{\rm UV}\equiv\log(L_{\rm 2500}/[{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}])$, we find the slope, $\gamma=0.69\pm0.02$ (hereafter all uncertainties are quoted at the 68% confidence level), and normalization, $l_{\rm X}=26.45\pm0.02$ at $l_{\rm UV}=30.5$, of the $L_{\rm 2keV}$ ($L_{\rm 2500}$) dependence. These values are not substantially different from the results of previous studies. A key novel aspect of our work is allowance for intrinsic scatter (which adds to the dispersion induced by quasar variability and flux measurement uncertainties) of the $L_{\rm 2keV}-L_{\rm 2500}$ relation in both variables, i.e. in X-ray and UV luminosity. The intrinsic X-ray scatter ($\sigma^2_{\rm intX}=0.066\pm0.005$) strongly dominates over the UV one ($\sigma^2_{\rm intUV}=0.001^{+0.003}_{-0.001}$). Further studies should seek to explain this behaviour in terms of accretion onto supermassive black holes and orientation of quasars with respect to the observer.

#### Constraints on nDGP gravity from SPT galaxy clusters with DES and HST weak-lensing mass calibration and from Planck PR4 CMB anisotropies

 - **Abstract**
 We present constraints on the normal branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) braneworld gravity model from the abundance of massive galaxy clusters. On scales below the nDGP crossover scale $r_{\rm c}$, the nDGP model features an effective gravity-like fifth force that alters the growth of structure, leading to an enhancement of the halo mass function (HMF) on cluster scales. The enhanced cluster abundance allows for constraints on the nDGP model using cluster samples. We employ the SPT cluster sample, selected through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZE) with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and with mass calibration using weak-lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The cluster sample contains 1,005 clusters with redshifts $0.25 < z < 1.78$, which are confirmed with the Multi-Component Matched Filter (MCMF) algorithm using optical and near-infrared data. Weak-lensing data from DES and HST enable a robust mass measurement of the cluster sample. We use DES Year 3 data for 688 clusters with redshifts $z < 0.95$, and HST data for 39 clusters with redshifts $ 0.6 < z <1.7$. We account for the enhancement in the HMF through a semi-analytic correction factor to the $\nu\Lambda$CDM HMF derived from the spherical collapse model in the nDGP model. We then further calibrate this model using $N$-body simulations. In addition, for the first time, we analyze the primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements from Planck PR4 within the nDGP model. We obtain a competitive constraint from the joint analysis of the SPT cluster abundance with the Planck PR4 data, and report an upper bound of $1/\sqrt{H_0r_{\rm c}}< 1.41$ at $95\%$ when assuming a cosmology with massive neutrinos.

 - **Abstract**
 Microquasars (MQs) are Galactic binary systems, consisting of a star and a compact object, a neutron star or a stellar mass black hole, which accretes matter from its companion star and gives rise to relativistic jets. Recent detection of very-high-energy (VHE; $E \gtrsim 100,\text{GeV}$) and ultra-high-energy (UHE; $E \gtrsim 100,\text{TeV}$) gamma-rays by LHAASO, HAWC and HESS from the MQ V4641 Sgr and SS 433 suggests them as Galactic PeVatrons. In this work, we studied a hadronic origin of the observed TeV-PeV gamma-ray emission from these MQs. We considered the hadronic scenario where the gamma-rays are produced by the interaction of relativistic protons in the MQ jet with the stellar wind. We fitted our model with observed data and constrained physical parameters like the hadronic jet power fraction, the proton spectral index, the maximum proton energy and the jet bulk Lorentz factor. Our best-fit model shows hard proton spectra ($1.84-2.44$) and maximum proton energies between 1 and 5 PeV. We also estimated the all-flavor neutrino fluxes corresponding to the gamma-ray fluxes from the hadronic model and found that V4641 sgr can be detected by next-generation neutrino telescopes like KM3NeT-ARCA and TRIDENT. Furthermore, we modeled a synthetic population of Galactic MQs and estimated their contribution to the diffuse TeV-PeV gamma-ray flux. For the inner Galaxy PSR contribution dominates in the range 10-100 TeV, and above 100 TeV diffused cosmic ray interactions with the molecular clouds is most dominant. We find that a population $\sim 14$ MQs is required to explain the LHAASO data above 100 TeV. For the outer Galaxy, we show that MQs are the dominant class of sources, and we constrain their population $\sim$14. Our findings strongly suggest that MQs are efficient particle accelerators, contributing to Galactic PeVatrons and potential multimessenger sources in our Galaxy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel graph-based machine learning classifier for identifying the dark matter cosmic web environments of galaxies. Large galaxy surveys offer comprehensive statistical views of how galaxy properties are shaped by large-scale structure, but this requires robust classifications of galaxies' cosmic web environments. Using stellar mass-selected IllustrisTNG-300 galaxies, we apply a three-stage, simulation-based framework to link galaxies to the total (mainly dark) underlying matter distribution. Here, we apply the following three steps: First, we assign the positions of simulated galaxies to a void, wall, filament, or cluster environment using the T-Web classification of the underlying matter distribution. Second, we construct a Delaunay triangulation of the galaxy distribution to summarise the local geometric structure with ten graph metrics for each galaxy. Third, we train a graph attention network (GAT) on each galaxy's graph metrics to predict its cosmic web environment. For galaxies with stellar mass $\mathrm{>10^9 M_{\odot}}$, our GAT+ model achieves an accuracy of $85\,\%$, outperforming graph-agnostic multilayer perceptrons and graph convolutional networks. Our results demonstrate that graph-based representations of galaxy positions provide a powerful and physically meaningful way to infer dark matter environments. We plan to apply this simulation-based graph modelling to investigate how the properties of observed galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey are influenced by their dark matter environments.

#### Effective $f(Q)$ model emerging from $f(Q,T)$ under a special EOS limit in symmetric cosmology with Bayesian and ANN observational constraints

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05142

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the cosmological consequences of an effective $f(Q)$ model emerging from the more general $f(Q,T)$ gravity theory under the special equation-of-state condition $\rho + p = 0$. Under this limit, the field equations yield the constraint $F(Q,T)H(t)=C$, implying that the function $F=f_Q$ becomes purely dependent on the nonmetricity scalar $Q$, and the background evolution mimics that of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We derive the resulting functional forms of $f(Q)$, obtain the corresponding effective cosmological constant, and analyze the physical nature of this reduction. To test the model against observations, we constrain the parameters $H_0$, $\Omega_m$, and $S_8$ using cosmic chronometers (CC), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and Pantheon+ SN Ia datasets. A comparative analysis is performed using both the conventional Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and a machine-learning based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) emulator. We find that the ANN approach yields tighter posterior constraints while significantly reducing computational time. The model successfully reproduces the observational trends of each dataset and offers insights into the persistent $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. Our results indicate that effective nonmetricity-based dark energy scenarios derived from $f(Q,T)$ gravity provide a viable and observationally consistent alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, with future high-precision surveys expected to further distinguish between these frameworks.

#### Images from disk and spherical accretions of Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the shadow and optical appearance of the Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) illuminated by various static accretions. First, we find that as the dark matter parameter $\left|\alpha\right|$ increases, the fundamental characteristic quantities of the black hole, the event horizon $r_h$, the photon sphere radius $r_{ph}$, and the critical impact parameter $b_{ph}$ all increase, while the peak of the effective potential $V_{\text{eff}}$ decreases and shifts toward the direction of increasing $r$. In contrast, the magnetic charge parameter $g$ suppresses $r_h$, $r_{ph}$, and $b_{ph}$, while increases the peak of $V_{\text{eff}}$ and shifts it toward the direction of decreasing $r$. This indicates a competing effect between the dark matter parameter $\left|\alpha\right|$ and the magnetic charge parameter $g$ on the fundamental properties of the black hole. Furthermore, we use the EHT observational data to constrain the dark matter parameters $\alpha$ and find that the constraint range given by the supermassive black hole SgrA* is stricter than that of the black hole M87*. Finally, the black hole images are studied based on different accretion models, and it is found that both dark matter parameters $\alpha$ and accretion models significantly influence the black hole images. For larger dark matter parameters $\left|\alpha\right|$, the inner shadow or central faint illuminating region of the Bardeen black hole surrounded by PFDM is larger but the bright ring of the image is fainter. This provides a potential method for us to distinguish between classical Bardeen black holes and Bardeen black holes surrounded by PFDM. These preliminary results may provide some clues for future investigations of dark matter using black hole shadows and images.

 - **Abstract**
 It has recently been argued that extremal black holes can act as amplifiers of new physics, due to horizon instabilities that enhance the effects of ultraviolet corrections. In this paper, we revisit some of these claims and investigate the viability of a class of non-spherical extremal black holes. In particular, we revisit the regularity of perturbed extremal Reissner--Nordström AdS black holes showing that, while some certain components of the scalar stress energy tensor diverge, the backreaction remains finite. We also study geodesic completeness, identifying a simple geometric constraint which, if satisfied, ensures that null geodesics cross the horizon smoothly. This analysis suggests the existence of a broad class of spacetimes with regular non-spherical horizons.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, references [1,2] found that the repetitive Penrose process cannot extract all the extractable rotational energy of a Kerr black hole, and reference [3] found that the repetitive electric Penrose process cannot extract all the electrical energy of a Reissner-Nordström (RN) black hole. This suggests that a law analogous to the third law of thermodynamics exists for the repetitive Penrose process. In this paper, we intend to study the repetitive Penrose process in the Kerr-de Sitter (Kerr-dS) black hole. We will explore influences of the cosmological parameter on the repetitive Penrose process. The results show that, in addition to a similar third law of thermodynamics, the Kerr-dS black hole yields a higher energy return on investment (EROI) and single-extraction energy capability compared to the Kerr black hole. Specifically, the larger the cosmological parameter, the stronger the EROI and the single-extraction energy capability. Furthermore, we also find that at a lower decay radius, the Kerr black hole exhibits a higher energy utilization efficiency (EUE) and more extracted energy after the repetitive Penrose process is completed. However, at a higher decay radius, the situation is reversed, i.e., the Kerr-dS black hole exhibits a higher EUE and more extracted energy, which is due to the existence of stopping condition of the iteration.

 - **Abstract**
 Tidal Love numbers (TLNs) characterize the response of compact objects to external tidal fields and vanish for classical Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes in general relativity. Nonvanishing TLNs therefore provide a potential observational window into new physics. In this work, we present a unified and fully analytic study of the TLNs of three representative classes of regular black holes -- the Bardeen black hole,the black hole with sub-Planckian curvature, and the black hole arising in asymptotically safe gravity -- under scalar, vector, and axial gravitational perturbations. Employing a Green's function method combined with systematic perturbative expansions, we show that TLNs of regular black holes are generically nonzero and exhibit strong model and mode dependence. In many cases, higher-order corrections develop logarithmic scale dependence, closely resembling renormalization-group running in quantum field theory and revealing a scale-dependent tidal response absent in classical black holes. Our analysis demonstrates that the internal structure of regular black holes, including de Sitter or Minkowski cores and quantum-gravity-inspired modifications, leaves distinct fingerprints in their tidal properties. These results establish TLNs as promising probes for testing regular black hole models with future gravitational-wave observations.

#### Domain Wall formation from $Z_2$ spontaneous symmetry breaking/restoration in Scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory

 - **Abstract**
 This study offers a detailed analysis of domain wall formation and its cosmological consequences in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity coupled to a scalar field. A central aspect of the model is the scalar field Lagrangian's ability to spontaneously break and restore its $Z_2$ discrete symmetry. This spontaneous symmetry breaking is a fundamental prerequisite for topological defect formation. In this context, domain walls arise as kink-like, solitonic solutions that interpolate between the distinct vacuum states of the theory. We perform a detailed numerical analysis of the dynamics of a neutral scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, exploring its behavior across different cosmological backgrounds. Our results show that coupling to the Gauss-Bonnet term enables the formation of static domain walls with a fixed proper distance within a de Sitter (inflationary) background. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to a radiation-dominated epoch, where we identify that the cosmic expansion causes the "melting" of these domain walls. To assess the potential observational signatures of this scenario, we calculate the predicted spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves generated by the network dynamics using {\it CosmoLattice} package. We also examine the possible generation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) associated with collapsing domain walls. Regrettably, our calculations indicate that the direct observational detection of such domain walls from this model lies beyond the reach of foreseeable experiments. Our results constitute a No-Go argument against the generation of PBHs as well as of large amplitude GW signals from domain walls in a Scalar-EGB spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism.
