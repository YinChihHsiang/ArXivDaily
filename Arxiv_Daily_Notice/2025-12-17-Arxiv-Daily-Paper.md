 - **Abstract**
 Radiation-driven winds are ubiquitous in massive stars, but in Very Massive Stars (VMSs), mass loss dominates their evolution, chemical yields, and ultimate fate. Theoretical predictions have often relied on extrapolations of O star prescriptions, likely underestimating true VMS mass-loss rates. In the first of a series of papers on VMS wind properties, we investigate a feature predicted by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations: a mass-loss `kink' or upturn where the single-scattering limit is breached and winds transition from optically thin to optically thick. We calculate hydrodynamically consistent non-LTE atmosphere models using the PoWR$^\mathrm{HD}$ code, with a grid spanning $40-135M_\odot$ and 12-50 kK at fixed $\log(L_\star/L_\odot) = 6.0$ and solar-like metallicity with $Z=0.02$. Our models confirm the existence of the kink, where the wind optical depth crosses unity and spectral morphology shifts from O star to WNh types. The predicted location of the kink coincides with the transition stars in the Galactic Arches cluster and reproduces the model-independent transition mass-loss rate of $\log(\dot{M}_\mathrm{trans}) \approx -5.16$ from Vink & Gräfener (2012). For the first time, we locate the kink at $\Gamma_\mathrm{e} \approx 0.43$ ($M_\star \approx 60M_\odot$) without relying on uncertain stellar masses. Above the kink, mass-loss rates scale much more steeply with decreasing mass (slope ~ 10), in qualitative agreement with MC predictions. We additionally identify two bistability jumps in the mass loss driven by Fe ionisation shifts: the first from FeIV to FeIII near 25 kK and the second from FeIII to FeII near 15 kK. Our models thus provide the first comprehensive confirmation of the VMS mass-loss kink while establishing a mass-loss relation with complex mass and temperature dependencies with consequences for stellar evolution, chemical yields, and the black hole mass spectrum.

#### Confirming membership in Local Group galaxies with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1

 - **Abstract**
 We use the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1) to identify stellar members of the Local Group dwarf galaxies. We cross-match DESI targets with candidate members that are based on Gaia proper motions, positions, and photometry. The addition of DESI radial velocities enables secure membership determination in 16 systems, spanning ultra-faint, classical, and irregular dwarf galaxies. Our results confirm that Gaia-based selection algorithms are effective in minimising foreground contamination. With DR1, we find the largest number of member stars for Draco and Sextans. While Draco is discussed in detail in other works, we focus on Sextans and, for the first time with DESI, trace its stellar kinematics to large radii (up to $\sim$10~half-light radii). Our derived systemic velocity and velocity dispersion are consistent with previous works. We find that the more metal-poor population exhibits a higher velocity dispersion and extends to larger radii, whereas the more metal-rich population is kinematically colder and centrally concentrated. The metallicity gradient is steeper in the inner regions of Sextans ($\sim -9\times 10^{-3}$~dex~arcmin$^{-1}$ or $\sim-0.29$~dex~kpc$^{-1}$), while almost no gradient in the outskirts, hinting for an ex-situ halo or for an ``outside-in'' star formation. Although DESI [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios for Sextans stars with [Fe/H]~$\gtrsim-2.0$ are in line with literature values, those for very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]~$\lesssim-2.0$) present a large scatter and strong anti-correlation with metallicity, warranting a caution for using DESI abundances in this regime. We find one ultra metal-poor candidate in Canes~Venatici~I, which requires higher resolution spectroscopic follow-ups.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding how mass and angular momentum flow through accretion discs remains a fundamental unsolved problem in astrophysics. Accreting white dwarfs offer an ideal laboratory for addressing this question: their variability occurs on accessible timescales of seconds to minutes, and their optical spectra contain continuum and emission-line components that trace distinct disc regions. Broad-band timing studies have revealed time-lags similar to those observed in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, suggesting propagating fluctuations and possible coupling to an inner hot flow. However, the blending of line and continuum light in broad filters prevents a physical interpretation of these signals. The 2040s will bring an unprecedented number of disc-accreting systems discovered by Rubin-LSST, space-based gravitational-wave observatories, and third-generation ground and space-based detectors. To extract disc physics from these sources, high-cadence optical spectral-timing, simultaneously resolving continuum and individual lines, is essential. Such measurements would directly map how variability propagates through discs, determine how the outer disc responds to changes in the inner flow, and test whether accretion physics is scale-invariant from white dwarfs to supermassive black holes. This white paper outlines the scientific motivation and observational capabilities required to realise this vision. It highlights the opportunity for ESO to enable a transformative new window on accretion physics in the coming decade.

#### Spirals and Vertical Motions in the Planet-Forming Disk around HD 100546. A multi-line study of its gas kinematics

 - **Abstract**
 HD100546 represents a particularly interesting target to study dynamical planet-disk interactions as various features have been observed in both the dust and gas that provide direct and indirect evidence for ongoing planet formation. In this work, we aim to characterize the gas kinematics of five molecular CO emission lines observed with ALMA in HD 100546, to reveal deviations from Keplerian rotation as well as substructures in the peak intensity and line width. We fit the molecular intensity channels with the Discminer package to model the line profiles. Aside from fitting the full cube, we also conduct runs where the blue- and redshifted sides are modeled separately to search for possible asymmetries. Our analysis reveals prominent kinematical spiral features in all five lines on large scales of the disk and we reproduce their morphology with both a linear and logarithmic spiral. In 12CO 2-1, spirals are also seen in the peak intensity residuals, the line width residuals exhibit a prominent ring of enhanced line widths around 125-330 au. The models further show, that the emission from the redshifted side may originate from higher disk layers than that from the blueshifted side. The pitch angles of the spirals are consistent with those driven by an embedded companion inside of 50 au and they suggest a dynamical mechanism rather than gravitational instabilities. We further find indications of a companion around 90-150 au, where tentative dips are present in the radial profiles of the integrated intensity of 13CO and C18O and pressure minima are observed in the azimuthal velocities. For the first time, we also detect downward vertical flows in this region, which coincide with the observed dust gap. The asymmetry in the emission heights may be a result of infall from the disk's environment. Another explanation is provided by a warped inner disk, casting a shadow onto one side of the disk.

#### Searching for Intermediate-Mass Black Holes in Milky Way satellites

 - **Abstract**
 Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), with masses between roughly $10^2\,M_\odot$ and $10^5\,M_\odot$, represent a largely uncharted component of the black-hole (BH) population. They are theoretically predicted to form in several early-Universe pathways, including the remnants of massive Population III stars, the runaway collapse of dense stellar clusters, and the direct collapse of metal-poor gas. Establishing whether IMBHs are present in dwarf galaxy satellites of the Milky Way (MW), and with what occupation fraction - i.e. the fraction of galaxies with a certain stellar mass that host a central BH - provides one of the most incisive tests of BH seed formation models. Despite their importance, present dynamical constraints on IMBHs remain weak. Dynamical IMBH masses or upper limits are available for very few such systems, with secure detections in less than ten cases. A next-generation wide-field spectroscopic facility, capable of combining deep multiplexed stellar spectroscopy with high-resolution integral-field observations of galaxy centers, would open access to IMBH masses in the $\leq10\,M_\odot$ regime. Such an advance would make possible - for the first time - a robust measurement of the IMBH occupation fraction in dwarf galaxies. A key scientific requirement for the coming decades is to establish the observational and instrumental capabilities needed to detect or tightly constrain IMBHs in nearby dwarf galaxies, particularly in the $\simeq10^3-10^4 \,M_\odot$ mass range, and thereby enable a measurement of their occupation fraction. Such a measurement is fundamental for distinguishing between competing scenarios for the formation of BH seeds in the early Universe.

#### Local Group dwarf galaxies as dark matter probes

 - **Abstract**
 Unveiling the fundamental nature of non-baryonic dark matter (DM) has profound implications for our understanding of the Universe and of the physical laws that govern it. Its manifestation as an additional source of matter necessary to explain astrophysical and cosmological observations indicates either a breakdown of General Relativity or that the current Standard Model of Particle Physics is incomplete. In the standard Cold DM (CDM) paradigm, DM consists of collisionless non-relativistic particles with negligible non-gravitational interactions. This simple hypothesis is very successful on large and intermediate scales, but faces challenges on small galactic scales. Local Group (LG) dwarf galaxies can play a fundamental role to elucidate whether these challenges stem from poorly understood fundamental baryonic processes or instead indicate that alternative DM scenarios need to be considered. In particular, a systematic determination of their DM halo properties as a function of stellar mass and star formation histories (SFH) will provide crucial observational benchmarks for models to deal with the trickiest issue that prevents us from advancing in our understanding of DM nature, i.e. the impact of baryonic processes in altering the properties of the inner regions of DM haloes. Such systematic study would require assembling accurate l.o.s. velocities (and metallicities) for several thousands of stars per galaxy, for an heterogeneous sample of target galaxies, spanning order of magnitudes in stellar mass and covering distances from about 100 kpc to more than 1 Mpc. This calls for both multi-objects spectrographs on 12m-class telescopes with fov of a few deg2 and a multiplex power in the several 1000s with the capability of providing dense sampling of the innermost regions, as well as for wide-area multi-objects spectrographs with fov of several arcmin2 on 30-40m class telescopes.

#### Convective Core Evolution of Main-Sequence Stars in Rapid Population Synthesis I: Framework and Implementation

 - **Abstract**
 Stars spend most of their lifetime on the main sequence (MS), where hydrogen burning establishes the internal chemical structure that governs the subsequent evolution. In massive stars, mass loss through winds and binary interactions can significantly modify this structure during the MS. We present a new MS evolution framework suitable for rapid binary population synthesis, implemented in the COMPAS code. Building on the semi-analytical model of Shikauchi et al. (2025), our framework captures the evolution of the convective core on the MS under arbitrary mass-loss or mass-gain histories, including a treatment for stellar rejuvenation and MS mergers. This new framework yields more massive helium cores at terminal-age MS, more compact radii in stripped MS stars, and systematically higher black hole masses than commonly used prescriptions. By providing a more realistic treatment of MS evolution, this framework improves the physical consistency of massive stars and binary evolution in rapid population synthesis.

#### AtLAST -- Cosmology with submillimetre galaxies magnification bias

 - **Abstract**
 Magnification bias offers a uniquely powerful and independent route to cosmological information. As a gravitational-lensing observable, it probes galaxy-matter correlations without relying on galaxy shapes, PSF modelling, or intrinsic-alignment corrections. Its sensitivity spans both geometry and growth: magnification bias simultaneously responds to the matter density, the amplitude of structure, and the redshift evolution of dark energy (DE) below $z \leq 1$. Importantly, its parameter degeneracy directions differ from those of shear, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, making it a complementary and consistency-check probe with substantial diagnostic value for the next decade of precision cosmology. However, the current potential of magnification bias is restricted by limited sky coverage, catalogue inhomogeneities, and insufficiently precise redshift or number-count characterisation. A next-generation wide-field submillimetre facility like AtLAST -- capable of uniform, deep surveys and spectroscopic mapping -- would overcome these limitations and transform magnification bias into a competitive, high-precision cosmological tool.

#### From ASTRID to BRAHMA -- The role of overmassive black holes in little red dots in cosmological simulations

 - **Abstract**
 We leverage the overmassive black holes ($\rm M_{BH}/M_{\ast} \approx0.1$) present in a realization of the BRAHMA cosmological hydrodynamic simulation suite to investigate their role in the emission of the unique ``little red dot'' (LRD) objects identified by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these black holes can produce LRD-like observables when their emission is modeled with a dense gas cloud shrouding the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Between redshifts 5 and 8, we find the number density of LRDs in this simulation to be $\rm 2.04 \pm 0.32 \times 10^{-4} \space Mpc^{-3}$, which is broadly consistent with current estimates for the total LRD population from JWST. Their emission in the rest-frame visible spectrum is dominated by their AGN, which induces the red color indicative of LRDs via a very strong Balmer break. Additionally, the elevated mass of the black holes reduces the temperature of their accretion discs. This shifts the peak of the AGN emission towards longer wavelengths, and increases their brightness in the rest-frame visible spectrum relative to lower mass black holes accreting at the same rate. These simulated LRDs have very minimal dust attenuation ($\rm A_V = 0.21 \pm 0.12$), limiting the amount of dust re-emission that would occur in the infrared, making them very likely to fall below the observed detection limits from observatories like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In contrast to the BRAHMA box, the ASTRID simulation produces systematically smaller black holes and predicts LRD number densities that are more than two orders of magnitude lower than current measurements. We therefore conclude that the presence of black holes that are overmassive relative to their host galaxy, and enshrouded in dense gas, is necessary for AGN-dominated LRD models to reproduce both the observed properties and abundances of JWST LRD populations.

#### Primordial Black Holes as Seeds for Extremely Overmassive AGN Observed by JWST

 - **Abstract**
 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently identified Abell 2744-QSO1 as a compact, metal-poor, black hole (BH) dominated galaxy at $z\simeq 7$. This system exhibits an extreme black-hole-to-stellar mass ratio and unusually low metallicity, posing significant challenges to BH seeding models. Motivated by these discoveries, we perform high-resolution cosmological simulations with a massive primordial black hole (PBH; $M_{\rm BH}=5\times10^7\,M_\odot$) seed, incorporating for the first time a fully coupled treatment of PBH accretion, BH feedback, and Population~III/II star formation and stellar feedback. Although PBHs accelerate structure formation through the seed effect, the associated strong thermal feedback from the accretion delays the onset of star formation to $z\lesssim 10$, producing short, bursty episodes throughout the subsequent evolution. PBH-driven outflows expel enriched gas from the nucleus, while sustained inflows from the intergalactic medium continuously replenish pristine material. This feedback-regulated cycle naturally yields low accretion rates ($\dot{m}_{\rm BH}/\dot{m}_{\rm edd} \sim 1-10\%$), subsolar metallicities ($Z/Z_\odot\lesssim10^{-2}$) and extreme $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios during both the initial star-forming phase and the subsequent quenching phases, in excellent agreement with JWST observations. Our results demonstrate that massive PBHs offer a viable pathway for forming the most extreme high-redshift systems, providing a physically motivated explanation for the extraordinary properties of Abell 2744-QSO1, as a sub-class of the broader population of JWST-discovered "little red dots".

#### Can dwarf spheroidal galaxies host a central black hole ?

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14146

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.14146

 - **Abstract**
 We construct mass models of Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies to place constraints on the central black hole (BH) masses they can host. We model the galaxies as a three-component system consisting of the stars, dark matter halo, and a central black hole, using the Osipkov--Merritt--Cuddeford class of anisotropic distribution function. The posterior distribution of black hole mass remains flat toward the low-mass end, indicating that the kinematic data places an upper limit on the black hole mass. Our analysis yields a 95% credible upper limit of $\log(M_{\bullet}/M_{\odot}) < 6$. We combine our results with black hole mass measurements and upper limits from the literature to construct a unified $M_{\bullet}$--$\sigma_{}$ relation spanning $\sigma_{} \sim 10$--$300,\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$, described by $\log(M_{\bullet}) = 8.32 + 4.08,\log\left(\sigma_{}/200,\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}\right)$, with an intrinsic scatter of $\sigma_{\rm int} = 0.55$. We compare the inferred limits to models of black hole growth via momentum-driven accretion and stellar capture, which predict black hole masses in the range $10^{3}$--$10^{4},M_{\odot}$ for the range $\sigma_{} \sim 6$--$12,\mathrm{km,s^{-1}}$, in close agreement with the $M_{\bullet}$--$\sigma_{*}$ relation within the 95% credible upper limits on the black hole masses derived in this work.

#### A one-parameter two-zone leptonic model for the blazar sequence

 - **Abstract**
 Blazars, a subclass of radio-loud active galactic nuclei with relativistic jets aligned close to our line of sight, emit highly variable non-thermal radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. The physical origin of their emission and the blazar sequence remain open questions. We present a self-consistent two-zone leptonic model in which relativistic electrons accelerate in a compact region, losing energy via synchrotron and inverse Compton processes, and escape into a larger zone permeated by an external photon field associated with magnetohydrodynamic winds from the accretion disk. By varying only the mass accretion rate onto the central black hole, the model naturally reproduces the blazar sequence, including Compton Dominance, $\gamma$-ray spectral indices, and the positions of synchrotron and inverse Compton peaks, while variations in secondary parameters account for the observed spread in the data. Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars exhibit strong external Compton emission from the extended zone, whereas BL Lac objects are dominated by synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission from the compact acceleration region. This framework highlights the key role of accretion rate and spatially structured emission zones in shaping blazar spectra and provides a unified interpretation of their diverse phenomenology.

 - **Abstract**
 Multi-messenger astronomy will be transformed in the 2040s by an unprecedented volume of detections from next-generation gravitational wave, high-energy, and ultra-high energy neutrino, cosmic ray, and time domain observatories. This white paper, prepared for the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Expanding Horizons call, outlines the key science questions enabled by this emerging multi-messenger ecosystem, ranging from nucleosynthesis and dense matter physics to cosmology, fundamental physics, and the growth of black holes across cosmic time. We demonstrate that fully exploiting these discoveries requires a step change in optical to near infrared spectroscopic capability, including low latency response, high throughput, and flexible time domain operations across both hemispheres. We argue that without a dedicated large-aperture time domain facility, the scientific return of multi-messenger astronomy in the 2040s will be considerably limited.

#### JWST Observations of the Double Nucleus in NGC 4486B: Possible Evidence for a Recent Binary SMBH Merger and Recoil

 - **Abstract**
 A recent study of the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B using JWST-NIRSpec IFU kinematics confirmed a supermassive black hole (SMBH) of mass $M_{BH}=3.6\pm0.7\times10^8$ (~8% of the stellar mass). In addition to its double nucleus, the nuclear kinematics show pronounced asymmetries: a velocity-dispersion peak displaced by 6 pc from the galaxy center and a ~16 km/s offset in the mean stellar line-of-sight velocity near the SMBH. We examine the origin of the 12 pc double nucleus and these asymmetries and show that the observations favor an SMBH surrounded by an eccentric nuclear disk (END). END formation models require the SMBH to experience a gravitational wave (GW) recoil following a binary SMBH merger. Our orbit-superposition models contain ~50% retrograde stars at the edge of the nuclear region, in striking agreement with END-formation simulations. We infer a pre-merger mass ratio q>0.15 and a recoil kick of ~340 km/s. Our N-body simulations show that with such a kick, the SMBH returns to the center within ~30 Myr. Its flat central core is also consistent with earlier binary black hole scouring. We test two alternative mechanisms-buoyancy-driven oscillations and a pre-merger SMBH binary-but neither reproduces the observed offsets, favoring the GW-kick scenario. Our direct N-body simulations further show that a prograde SMBH binary in a rotating host can stall in a corotation resonance, delaying coalescence. Thus, although NGC 4486B is an old, relaxed galaxy near the Virgo cluster center, its SMBH appears to have merged only recently, making its nucleus a rare nearby laboratory for studying post-merger SMBH dynamics.

#### Topological and optical signatures of modified black-hole entropies

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how deviations from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy modify black-hole spacetimes through the recently proposed entropy-geometry correspondence. For four representative modified entropies, namely Barrow, Rényi, Kaniadakis, and logarithmic, we derive the corresponding effective metrics and analyze their thermodynamic and topological classification using the off-shell free energy and winding numbers. We show that Barrow and Rényi entropies yield a single unstable sector with global charge $W=-1$, while logarithmic and Kaniadakis corrections produce canceling defects with $W=0$, revealing topological structures absent in the Schwarzschild case. Using the modified metrics, we further calculate the photon-sphere radius and shadow size, showing that each modified entropy relation induces characteristic optical shifts. Thus, by comparing with Event Horizon Telescope observations of Sgr A$^\ast$, we extract new bounds on all entropy-deformation parameters. Our results demonstrate that thermodynamic topology, together with photon-sphere phenomenology, offers a viable way to test generalized entropy frameworks and probe departures from the Bekenstein-Hawking area law.

 - **Abstract**
 Quantum-gravitational effective actions with higher-derivative and non-local operators are expected to regularize the singularities of general relativity. Here we focus on quasi-local Einstein-Weyl gravity and obtain a classification of Frobenius solutions in static spherical symmetry. In contrast to local Einstein-Weyl gravity, and more generally quadratic gravity, we find that the quasi-local theory admits only regular solutions at the radial core. In addition, we find asymptotic $1/r^{6}$-corrections to the Schwarzschild geometry at large radial distances. Other solution classes around generic expansion points describe Schwarzschild-like and other types of horizons, as well as symmetric and non-symmetric wormhole throats.

 - **Abstract**
 Binary black hole mergers with asymmetric component masses are key targets for both third-generation ground-based and future space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, offering unique access to the strong-field dynamics of gravity. The evolution is commonly divided into three stages: the adiabatic inspiral, the transition, and the plunge. To date, constructions of inspiral-transition-plunge waveforms have largely focused on Schwarzschild or Kerr background spacetimes. In this paper, we extend these efforts to spacetimes beyond Kerr by constructing such waveforms in a Kerr-Newman background. For simplicity, we allow the primary black hole to carry spin and charge while keeping the secondary object neutral and non-spinning. We work in the small charge-to-mass ratio regime and adopt the Dudley-Finley approximation, in which the gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations decouple. In particular, the gravitational sector satisfies a Teukolsky-like equation, enabling only minimal modifications relative to the Kerr case when constructing the waveform. Having the inspiral-transtion-plunge waveforms in hand, we studied observational prospects for constraining the charge of the central black hole. We find that, for intermediate-mass-ratio mergers observed with the Einstein Telescope, explicitly modeling the post-inspiral dynamics significantly tightens charge-to-mass ratio constraints. In particular, the bounds on the charge-to-mass ratio can reach $O(10^{-3})$ in the region of primary masses and spins where the post-inspiral signal dominates, yielding charge bounds that can be orders of magnitude tighter than those obtained from the inspiral alone or from the current bound with GW150914. These results lay the groundwork for inspiral-transition-plunge waveform modeling in beyond-Kerr spacetimes and for probing non-Kerr signatures in future GW observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Analogue gravity explores how collective excitations in condensed matter systems can reproduce the behavior of fields in curved spacetimes. An important example is the acoustic black holes that can occur for sound in a moving fluid. In these lecture notes, we focus on atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), quantum fluids that provide an interesting platform for analogue gravity studies thanks to their accurate theoretical description, remarkable experimental control, and ultralow temperatures that allow the quantum nature of sound to emerge. We give a pedagogical introduction to analogue black holes and the theoretical description of BECs and their elementary excitations, which behave as quantum fields in curved spacetimes. We then apply these tools to survey the current understanding of black-hole superradiance and analogue Hawking radiation, including explicit examples and numerical methods.

 A recent study [Annals Phys. 455 (2023) 169394, e-Print: 2204.01901 [gr-qc]] examined the thermodynamic behavior of an axially symmetric black hole within a non-commutative framework that mimics the effect of an angular momentum. However, the analysis presents notable computational inconsistencies. In that analysis, the event horizon was miscalculated, and this error propagated through and compromised all subsequent results. In addition, an incorrect definition of surface gravity was used -- the spherically symmetric case was invoked for an axially symmetric spacetime -- rendering the thermodynamic results invalid. In other words, all the results presented in the paper require a thorough reexamination.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole (BH) solutions endowed with nontrivial scalar or matter fields - commonly known as hairy black holes - have attracted significant interest in recent years. They admit extra parameters beyond mass, charge, and angular momentum, leading to a richer phenomenology. Characterizing their allowed parameter space is therefore crucial, especially in light of the available data from electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations. The rotating hairy black hole solutions studied here are inspired by the gravitational decoupling method and satisfy the Einstein field equations with a conserved energy-momentum tensor that respects the strong energy conditions (SECs). We explore in detail the horizon structure of such black holes and report for the first time certain unique features, not observed in Kerr BHs. We investigate the sensitivity of the hairy parameters on the fundamental frequencies associated with the motion of matter in the hairy Kerr spacetime, and compare them with the Kerr scenario. The theoretical models aimed to explain the observed high-frequency observations (HFQPOs) in BHs are associated with the fundamental frequencies. Hence, such a study enables us to constrain the parameter space of the hairy Kerr spacetime by comparing the model-dependent HFQPO frequencies with the available observations. By comparing the kinematic models of HFQPOs with the observations of six BH sources, we report the most favored parameter space for each of these BHs. Our analysis also provides a framework to discern the most suitable model for each of these sources. Interestingly, even with the present precision of the data, the Relativistic Precession Model seems to be less suitable compared to the Tidal Disruption Model for the sources GRO J1655-40 and XTE J1859+226. The implications are discussed.

 - **Abstract**
 This review examines the role of differential forms, Pfaffian systems, and hypersurfaces in general relativity. These mathematical constructions provide the essential tools for general relativity, in which the curvature of spacetime;described by the Einstein field equations;is most elegantly formulated using the Cartan calculus of differential forms. Another important subject in this discussion is the notion of conformal geometry, where the relevant invariants of a metric are characterized by Elie Cartan's normal conformal connection. The previous analysis is then used to develop the null surface formulation (NSF) of general relativity, a radical framework that postulates the structure of light cones rather than the metric itself as the fundamental gravitational variable. Defined by a central Pfaffian system, this formulation allows the entire spacetime geometry to be reconstructed from a single scalar function, $Z$, whose level surfaces are null.

 We characterize spin initial data sets that saturate the BPS bound in the asymptotically AdS setting. This includes both gravitational waves and rotating black holes in higher dimensions, and we establish a sharp dimension threshold in each case. A key ingredient in our argument is a theorem providing a general criterion for when an imaginary Killing spinor of mixed causal type can be replaced by one that is strictly timelike or null. Moreover, in analogy with the minimal surface method, we demonstrate that spinors can be used to construct a codimension-$2$ slicing.

 - **Abstract**
 We perform searches for gravitational wave memory in the data of two major Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments located in Europe and Australia. Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are the primary sources of gravitational waves in PTA experiments. We develop and carry out the first search for late inspirals and mergers of these sources based on full numerical relativity waveforms with null (nonlinear) gravitational wave memory. Additionally, we search for generic bursts of null gravitational wave memory, exploring possibilities of reducing the computational cost of these searches through kernel density and normalizing flow approximation of the posteriors. We rule out the mergers of SMBHBs with a chirp mass of 10^10 Solar Mass up to 700 Mpc over 18 years of observation at 95% credibility. We rule out the observation of generic displacement memory bursts with strain amplitudes > 10^-14 in brief periods of the observation time but across the sky, or over the whole observation time but for certain preferred sky positions, at 95%$credibility.

 - **Abstract**
 The growing number of gravitational wave (GW) detections and the increasing sensitivity of GW detectors have enabled precision tests of General Relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime. The recent observation of multiple quasinormal modes (QNMs) in GW250114 marks a major advance for observational black hole spectroscopy. This clear signal, together with the growing number of GW detections, highlights the need for accurate predictions of QNM spectra in beyond-GR theories in order to carry out precision searches for new physics. In this work, we continue to lay the foundation for such predictions using a modified Teukolsky formalism in conjunction with the eigenvalue perturbation method. We compute the spectral shifts of slowly rotating Johannsen-Psaltis black holes for $2 \leq \ell \leq 10$, all $m$, and overtones $n = 0, 1, 2$, and confirm the large-$\ell$ behavior of the modes by comparing with the WKB approximation. We find that these black holes admit definite-parity modes but break the isospectrality between even- and odd-parity QNMs at all spins, and that the shifts depend linearly on $m$ for slow spins. We further derive a general parity condition that any beyond-GR modification to the metric must satisfy to support definite-parity modes, providing new insights into isospectrality breaking and parity structure in gravitational perturbations.

#### "Filtering" CFTs at large N: Euclidean Wormholes, Closed Universes, and Black Hole Interiors

 - **Abstract**
 Despite its successes, the large-$N$ holographic dictionary remains incomplete. Key features of gravitational path integrals--most notably Euclidean wormholes and the associated failure of factorization--lack a clear interpretation in the standard large-$N$ framework. A related challenge is the possibility of erratic $N$-dependence in CFT observables, behavior with no evident semiclassical gravitational counterpart. We argue that these puzzles point to a missing ingredient in the dictionary: a large-$N$ filter. This filter projects out the erratic $N$-dependence of CFT quantities when mapping them to semiclassical bulk physics, providing an intrinsic boundary definition of gravitational "averages." It also offers a boundary explanation of wormhole contributions and a boundary prediction of their amplitudes, thereby giving a natural resolution of the factorization puzzle. In addition, we derive an infinite tower of inequalities constraining wormhole amplitudes and argue that internal wormholes do not induce random couplings in the low-energy effective theory. Beyond resolving factorization, the large-$N$ filter supplies a generalized framework from which richer Lorentzian spacetime structures can emerge, including closed universes and black hole interiors. We argue that, as a consequence of erratic large-$N$ behavior, both closed universes and black hole interiors are quantum volatile, and that an AdS spacetime entangled with a baby universe is likewise quantum volatile. This volatility may allow an observer in AdS to infer the existence of the baby universe, whereas for an infalling observer, the ability to make measurements near a black hole horizon may become fundamentally limited--even if they may not live long enough to notice.

#### Black Holes and Abelian Instantons

 - **Abstract**
 We argue that the electromagnetic $\theta$-term is a physical parameter of the Standard Model coupled to gravity. Specifically, in the context of 4-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory we show that there exist Euclidean field configurations that have finite action, are asymptotically flat, and feature non-zero electromagnetic second Chern number. These ``gravitational Abelian instantons" correspond to a dyonic extension of a Euclidean wormhole. We argue that these configurations should be included in the gravitational path integral, and that doing so generates a non-perturbative contribution to the vacuum energy density that is $\theta$-dependent. We provide a Lorentzian interpretation of these instantons as capturing the effect of quantum fluctuations corresponding to pair production and annihilation of charged black holes. When $\theta$ is the expectation value of a dynamical axion field, the instantons presented here generate a potential for the axion, thereby breaking the axion shift symmetry. This provides yet another example of how quantum gravity violates global symmetries through the existence of black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Vacuum bubbles, formed in first order phase transitions, have important implications for cosmology. In particular, they source gravitational waves. Usually, it is assumed that, once bubbles are materialized, their state, further evolution and mergers are well-described classically. This paper will show that this intuition breaks down for bubbles which possess high microstate degeneracy. This is generic when the phase transition breaks spontaneously a symmetry. First, the degeneracy enhances the transition rate. Furthermore, the internal quantum state of the bubbles profoundly affects the classical dynamics of their mergers. A bubble, no matter how macroscopic, is born in a maximally entangled quantum state. This state can be viewed as a symmetric superposition of many different would-be classical bubbles. The inner entanglement is largely maintained up until their mergers. The resulting true quantum dynamics of the merger is macroscopically different from any type of classical mergers. These differences are imprinted as macroscopic features in the resulting classical gravitational waves. In this way, the inner microstate entanglement of merging bubbles provides a qualitatively new source of gravitational waves. This phenomenon is quantified and compared with the swift memory burden effect in black hole mergers.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the effects of quantum gravity for models of a scalar singlet coupled to the metric. Such models describe inflation for early cosmology and dynamical dark energy for late cosmology. We work within the ''variable gravity approximation" keeping in the effective action an arbitrary field dependence for terms with up to two derivatives. We focus on the scaling solutions of the gauge invariant functional flow equation which describes the dependence of the effective action on a momentum or length scale. The existence of such solutions is required for the ultraviolet fixed point defining an ultraviolet complete renormalizable quantum field theory for gravity. Our findings strengthen the case for the presence of a ''dilaton quantum gravity fixed point" for which the Planck mass increases proportional to the scalar field for large field values. This fixed point is different from the extended Reuter fixed point with a flat scalar potential and field-independent Planck mass, which is also seen in our setting.

 - **Abstract**
 In the exploration of the vast string landscape, we provide new analytic solutions of non-SUSY black branes in 10-D heterotic supergravity which exhibit a phase transition. Our black brane solutions carry two kinds of gauge charges but still are exact, which extends the recent developments in classification of heterotic branes. The solutions offer a novel method to embed previously known noncritical 2-D or 3-D solutions to the critical dimensions. Furthermore, by performing a perturbative analysis of the non-Abelian gauge field on this exact background, we analytically find that as the temperature decreases, a spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs, leading to a dynamical instability accompanied by gauge field condensation. This instability embodies a phase transition of black branes in heterotic supergravity, and analytically predicts the existence of unknown black hole solutions to be unveiled. Our results suggest that phase transition phenomena can be used to explore and analyze the phase structure of black hole solutions, for systematically discovering and classifying stringy black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 We derive the general form of the effective equations governing black hole dynamics in the limit of a large number of dimensions $D$. These split into a universal \emph{soap-bubble} embedding condition for stationary configurations and a set of nonlinear dynamical evolution equations describing near-horizon fluctuations of $O(1/D)$ amplitude over horizon scales of $O(1/\sqrt{D})$. We obtain these equations in full generality, including arbitrary asymptotic sources in the near-horizon region, and we show that they form a parabolic system with a well-posed initial value problem. To connect the various approaches to large-$D$ black hole dynamics, we also show that both the embedding and dynamical equations can be derived from the covariant membrane formalism. We clarify the intrinsic scope of the large-$D$ approach, emphasizing that it yields a well-posed dynamical evolution only on horizon scales of $O(1/\sqrt{D})$, which is the range where the most relevant horizon dynamics occur. Our results highlight the versatility of these effective theories for studying a wide class of black hole phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a comprehensive discussion of gravitational charges and radiation in four-dimensional asymptotically locally de Sitter (AldS) spacetimes. Such spacetimes have compact spatial sections and possess spacelike past and future infinities, $\mathscr{I}^\pm$. We show that the variational problem is well-posed if one specifies a conformal class up to three-dimensional diffeomorpshims at $\mathscr{I}^\pm$, provided one adds at $\mathscr{I}^\pm$ suitable local terms. These are analogues of the AdS covariant counterterms of holographic renormalisation. Radiation is possible only when the conformal class at infinity is non-trivial. Bulk diffeomorphisms that asymptote to conformal Killing vectors at $\mathscr{I}^\pm$ lead to gravitational charges that are conserved under radial translations, while transformations that asymptote to a general three-dimensional vector imply that the gravitational charges satisfy flux-balance laws. We also present quantities that are invariant under temporal translations, if gravitational flux is absent, but otherwise satisfy flux-balance laws. We derive these results using first principles application of Noether's method as well as covariant phase space methods. We apply our formalism to several exact solutions, including the Robinson-Trautman-dS class, which we use to demonstrate the existence of conserved charges even in the absence of asymptotic conformal Killing vectors and the existence of monotonic charges, including the Bondi mass.

 - **Abstract**
 The ultra-relativistic (Carrollian) regime of gravity has recently emerged as a fertile framework for exploring holography, non-Lorentzian symmetries, and geometric limit of General Relativity. In this letter, we establish the presence of a non-vanishing torsion within three-dimensional Carrollian gravity by constructing the Carrollian Mielke-Baekler (C-MB) gravity theory in its Chern-Simons formulation, obtained as the ultra-relativistic limit of the relativistic Mielke-Baekler model. The resulting C-MB theory features non-zero temporal torsion and curvature, together with spatial curvature, providing the most general three-dimensional Carrollian gravity model with these properties. Several known ultra-relativistic gravity theories arise as particular limits of this framework, highlighting its unifying character.

 In-in correlators are the basic observables in cosmology and are traditionally computed using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. In this paper we revisit this formalism for photons, gluons, and gravitons coupled to scalars in four dimensional de Sitter space and provide a novel treatment of boundary gauge-fixing of the underlying path integral. We also derive effective actions in Euclidean Anti-de Sitter space whose Feynman rules compute the in-in correlators of these theories in de Sitter space, generalising the shadow formalism recently obtained for scalar theories. We illustrate this formalism in a number of examples at tree-level and 1-loop, demonstrating its relative simplicity compared to other approaches. Moreover, we initiate the study of color/kinematics duality and the double copy for in-in correlators using dressing rules which uplift flat space Feynman diagrams to de Sitter space.
