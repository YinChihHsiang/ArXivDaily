 - **Abstract**
 Tidal disruption events (TDEs) have traditionally been discovered in optical sky surveys through targeted searches of nuclear transients. However, it is expected that some TDEs will occur outside the galaxy nucleus, arising from wandering black holes originating in galaxy mergers. Here we present observations of TDE 2025abcr, the first optical TDE discovered in the outskirts of a host galaxy. The TDE was identified by a custom 'off-nuclear' implementation of the ML classifier $\texttt{tdescore}$, which classifies new ZTF transients based on their lightcurves. Follow-up observations confirm that TDE 2025abcr is a TDE-H+He, occurring 9.5$"$ (10.3 kpc projected distance) from the nucleus of a massive galaxy ($\mathrm{M}_{\star}$ = $10^{11.18 \pm 0.03}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) with a central black hole mass of $10^{8.82 \pm 0.65}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. TDE 2025abcr itself was likely disrupted by a much lighter black hole ($10^{6.09\pm0.53}\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, as estimated with peak luminosity scaling relations). The black hole was either dynamically ejected from the nucleus or lies at the center of a very faint tidally-stripped dwarf galaxy undergoing a minor merger. Late-time observations of TDE 2025abcr could confirm the origin of this apparent 'orphan' black hole. The rate of highly offset ($\gtrsim$3 kpc) TDEs can be constrained to $<$10% of the nuclear TDE rate, but our discovery implies that many dozens of similar sources will be detected by the Vera C. Rubin each year with resolvable offsets.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar collisions can occur frequently in dense cluster environments, and play a crucial role in producing exotic phenomena from blue stragglers in globular clusters to high-energy transients in galactic nuclei. Successive collisions and mergers of massive stars could also lead to the formation of massive black holes, serving as seeds for supermassive black hole in the early universe. While analytic fitting formulae exist for predicting collision outcomes, they do not generalize across different energy scales or stellar evolutionary phases. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations are often used to compute the outcomes of stellar collisions, but, even at low resolution, their computational cost makes running on-the-fly calculations during an $N$-body simulation quite challenging. Here we present a new grid of $27,720$ SPH calculations of main-sequence star collisions, spanning a wide range of masses, ages, relative velocities, and impact parameters. Using this grid, we train machine learning models to predict both collision outcomes (merger vs disruption, or flyby) and final remnant masses. We compare the performance of nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks, achieving classification balanced accuracy of $98.4\%$, and regression relative errors as low as $0.11\%$ and $0.15\%$ for the final stars $1$ and $2$, respectively. We make our trained models publicly available as part of the package collAIder, enabling rapid predictions of stellar collision outcomes in $N$-body models of dense star cluster dynamics.

#### Evidence for neutrino emission from X-ray Bright Seyfert Galaxies in the Southern Hemisphere using Enhanced Starting Track Events with IceCube

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube recently reported the observation of TeV neutrinos from the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC~1068, and the corresponding neutrino flux is significantly higher than the upper limit implied by observations of GeV-TeV gamma rays. This suggests that neutrinos are produced near the supermassive black hole, where the radiation density is high enough to obscure gamma rays. We use a set of muon neutrinos with interaction vertices inside the detector, which have good sensitivity to sources in the Southern sky, from IceCube data recorded between 2011 and 2021. We then search for individual and collective neutrino signals from 14 Seyfert galaxies in the Southern Sky selected from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) AGN Spectroscopic Survey. Using the correlations between keV X-rays and TeV neutrinos predicted by disk-corona models, and assuming production characteristics similar to NGC~1068, a collective neutrino signal search reveals an excess of $6.7_{-3.2}^{+4.0}$ events, which is inconsistent with background expectations at the 3$\sigma$ level of significance. In this paper, we present new independent evidence that Seyfert galaxies contribute to the extragalactic flux of high-energy neutrinos.

#### JWST spectra are consistent with the edge-on star-forming galaxy scenario for the "runaway supermassive black hole"

 - **Abstract**
 The linear structure reported by van Dokkum et al. (2023) has been proposed as either a massive stellar wake produced by a runaway supermassive black hole (SMBH) or a bulgeless edge-on galaxy. New JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations target the tip of the structure, where a SMBH would produce a bow shock, whereas a normal galaxy would host an HII region. Using standard BPT diagrams ([OIII]5007/Hb vs [NII]6583/Ha and [OIII]5007/Hb vs [OII]6716,6731/Ha), we find that the line ratios at the tip fall on the locus of low-metallicity low-extinction HII regions. This region does not overlap with loci typical of shocks in merging galaxies. Thus, these results are consistent with the interpretation that the linear structure is a star-forming galaxy, with the bright knot representing one of its HII regions.

 - **Abstract**
 The dense Galactic Center environment is expected to host compact binary inspirals detectable by future space-borne gravitational wave (GW) observatories (e.g., LISA, TianQin, Taiji) in the millihertz band. Aided by information from these facilities, next-generation ground-based GW detectors (e.g., Cosmic Explorer, Einstein Telescope) can potentially capture gravitational radiation in the hectohertz band from rapidly spinning neutron star (NS) components in such binaries. These Galactic Center systems are thus anticipated to act as dual-line (i.e., low-frequency inspiral and high-frequency spin) GW sources. However, the formation channels of these systems remain largely unexplored. In this \textit{Letter}, we propose that the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect can enhance the formation of dual-line GW sources in hierarchical triples involving the Galactic supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. We show that ZLK-driven oscillations in the eccentricity and inclination of the inner binary can modulate the GW emission from both the binary inspiral and the individual NS spins. This effect boosts the expected dual-line source count by a factor of $\sim 3$, from rare to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in 4 years, making dual-line observations substantially more probable. Our results demonstrate that the ZLK effect provides an important formation channel for Galactic dual-line GW sources.

#### Population Properties of Binary Black Holes with Eccentricity

 - **Abstract**
 The improved sensitivity of Gravitational-Wave detectors and the development of eccentric waveform models enable us to explore the growing catalog of gravitational-wave events with measurable eccentricity. This opens new opportunities to gain insight into the formation channels and evolutionary pathways of compact binary systems using eccentricity. However, most recent population analyses have been limited to quasi-circular binaries, primarily due to constraints in waveform modeling and sensitivity estimates. We are now entering an era where both of these limitations are being addressed, allowing for a more comprehensive investigation of eccentric binary populations. In this work, we perform the first population inference analysis that simultaneously fits the mass, spin, redshift, and eccentricity distribution. Specifically, we use source-parameter estimation provided by the Rapid Iterative FiTting (RIFT) framework using the SEOBNRv5EHM waveform model, and a default O4a population model extended to include eccentricity. We find population properties broadly consistent with conclusions obtained in previous analyses assuming quasi-circular binaries. Consistent with our conclusions about each event, we bound the branching ratio for eccentric events to be below $0.0239$ at $90\%$ confidence with our fiducial eccentricity mixture models. Using four different parametric population models for eccentricity, we point out that the rate of eccentric events is weakly constrained by observations and highly model-dependent.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole jets represent one of the most extreme manifestations of astrophysical processes, linking accretion physics, relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, and large-scale feedback in galaxies and clusters. Despite decades of observational and theoretical work, the mechanisms governing jet launching, collimation, and energy dissipation remain open questions. In this article, we discuss how upcoming facilities such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST), and the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) will provide unprecedented constraints on jet dynamics, variability, and multi-wavelength signatures. Furthermore, we highlight theoretical challenges, including the role of magnetically arrested disks (MADs), plasma microphysics, and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations in shaping our understanding of jet formation. By combining high-resolution imaging, time-domain surveys, and advanced simulations, the next decade promises transformative progress in unveiling the physics of black hole jets.

#### Non-thermal X-ray Emission from Merging Massive Black Hole Binaries

 - **Abstract**
 Recent hydrodynamical simulations have identified a disappearing thermal X-ray signature in massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) embedded in circumbinary disks, arising from the tidal truncation and depletion of minidiscs shortly before merger. This feature has been proposed as a promising electromagnetic counterpart to MBHB mergers detectable by LISA. In this work, we examine whether non-thermal X-ray emission powered by magnetic reconnection could obscure or modify this thermal X-ray drop. We construct semi-analytic models for both the thermal X-ray emission from minidiscs and the non-thermal synchrotron emission produced by reconnection in magnetically dominated black hole magnetospheres. Evaluating these models across the MBHB mass range relevant for LISA, we find that for physically motivated magnetic field strengths and accretion rates, the non-thermal X-ray luminosity remains several orders of magnitude below the thermal component throughout the inspiral. Even under optimistic assumptions that enhance the non-thermal emission, it remains significantly subdominant. We further incorporate the magnetospheric balding framework to model the decay of non-thermal emission near merger, finding that reconnection-powered X-ray emission fades on short, mass-scaled timescales once the external magnetic flux supply is disrupted. Taken together, our results indicate that non-thermal emission is unlikely to mask the disappearing thermal X-ray signature, reinforcing its robustness as an electromagnetic counterpart to MBHB mergers and its potential utility for multi-messenger studies with LISA.

 - **Abstract**
 We numerically construct a one-parameter family of critical spacetimes in arbitrary continuous dimensions D>3. This generalizes Choptuik's D=4 solution to spherically symmetric massless scalar-field collapse at the threshold of D-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole formation. We refer to these solutions, which share the discrete self-similarity of their four-dimensional counterpart, as critical spacetime crystals. Our main results are the echoing period and Choptuik exponent of the crystals as continuous functions of D, with detailed data for the interval 3.05<D<5.5. Notably, the echoing period has a maximum near D=3.76. As a by-product, we recover the echoing periods and Choptuik exponents in D=4 (5): Delta=3.445453 (3.22176) and gamma=0.373961 (0.41322). We support these numerical results with analytical expansions in 1/D and D-3. They suggest that both the echoing period and Choptuik exponent vanish as D approaches 3 from above. This paves the way for a small-(D-3) expansion, paralleling the large-$D$ expansion of general relativity. We also extend our results to two-dimensional dilaton gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper examines a recently introduced class of regular black holes that can form from the collapse of a polytropic star with an arbitrary polytropic index. This class has a de Sitter core and reduces to the Bardeen and Hayward black holes when the polytropic index is chosen appropriately. We demonstrate that this class of black holes is sourced by a nonlinear electrodynamics Lagrangian in $d$ dimensions and that its regularity stems from the presence of magnetic charge. We analyze the energy conditions and study the photon spheres analytically and the shadows numerically. Then, we compare our results with observations. Additionally, we present the thermodynamic properties of this class of black holes, including their temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. We also examine their thermodynamic stability. Finally, we generalize the Oppenheimer-Snyder-Datt collapse scenario to this $d$-dimensional class of black holes and study stellar collapse into them, as well as the evolution of the star's surface, the apparent horizon, and the event horizon.

#### The measurable impact of the 2pN spin-dependent accelerations on the jet precession of M87$^\ast$

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by recent accurate measurements of disk/jet coprecessions around some galactic supermassive black holes, the accelerations experienced by an uncharged, spinless object in the Kerr metric, written in harmonic coordinates, are analytically calculated up to the formal second post-Newtonian order. To such a level, some new accelerations make their appearance. They are proportional to even and odd powers of the hole's angular momentum. Their counterparts are not known where the primary is a material body. After expressing them in a coordinate-independent, vector form valid for any orientations of the hole's spin axis in space, their orbital effects are perturbatively worked out in terms of the particle's Keplerian orbital elements. The resulting expressions, averaged over one orbital revolution, are valid for generic shapes and inclinations of the orbit. The orbital plane's precession proportional to the first power of the hole's angular momentum and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light amounts to about twenty per cent of the corresponding Lense-Thirring effect. The latter is believed to be the cause of the accurately measured disk/jet precessional phenomenology, currently measured to a few per cent accuracy. Although at a lesser extent, also the precession proportional to the second power of the hole's spin and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light is measurable. Allowed domains in the parameter space of the jet precession around M87$^\ast$ are displayed.

#### Spacetime of rotating black holes surrounded by massive scalar charges

 - **Abstract**
 Massive scalar charges are ubiquitous in extensions to General Relativity and the Standard Model in particle physics. We describe spectral methods which can accurately construct the spacetime of rotating black holes with dimensionless spin up to $a \leq 0.8$ surrounded by massive scalar fields nonminimally coupled to spacetime curvature. We consider axi dilaton, dynamical Chern Simons, and scalar Gauss Bonnet couplings, and obtain leading order solutions for both the scalar field and the associated metric modifications. Our method accurately resolves massive scalar fields with Compton wavelengths as short as 5 times the black hole mass, achieving residual errors $\lesssim 10^{-5}$, and yields the corresponding leading order spacetime modifications with residual errors $\lesssim 10^{-3}$. Using the constructed spacetimes, we computes the leading-order shifts in the surface gravity and the angular velocity of the event horizon, important information for computing the quasinormal modes. These results pave the way to incorporate massive scalar charges into electromagnetic observations and gravitational-wave detections of black holes, potentially enabling new probes of fundamental scalar degrees of freedom.

 - **Abstract**
 Astrophysical black holes are embedded in surrounding dark and baryonic matter that can measurably perturb the spacetime. We construct a self-consistent spacetime describing a slowly rotating black hole embedded in an external matter distribution, modeling the surrounding dark matter halo as an anisotropic fluid. Working within the slow-rotation approximation, we capture leading-order spin and frame-dragging effects while retaining analytic transparency. We show that the presence and rotation of the halo induce distinct deviations from the vacuum black hole geometry, modifying inertial frame dragging, equatorial circular geodesics, the light ring, the innermost stable circular orbit, and radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies. These effects produce systematic shifts in orbital constants of motion and the locations of epicyclic resonances. In particular, the epicyclic frequency ratios develop nonmonotonic behavior, such as local minima. We further demonstrate that these features depend on the angular velocity of the surrounding fluid, reflecting the interplay between environmental gravity and frame dragging. Our results demonstrate that environmental and rotational effects can leave observable imprints on precision strong-field probes, particularly extreme mass-ratio inspirals, where small corrections accumulate over many orbital cycles. This work provides a minimal and extensible framework for incorporating realistic astrophysical environments into strong-field tests of gravity with future space-based gravitational-wave detectors.

#### Exact Dynamical Regular Black Holes from Generalized Polytropic Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We present a class of exact, dynamical, and fully analytic solutions describing regular black holes formed via the gravitational collapse of matter obeying a generalized polytropic equation of state. Starting from a Vaidya-type geometry with a radially dependent mass function, we demonstrate that regularization of the Kiselev solutions can be achieved through a physically motivated modification of the energy density profile. This procedure leads to nonsingular spacetimes with a de~Sitter core and finite curvature invariants at the center. We show that the resulting matter content is naturally described by a generalized polytropic equation of state of the form $P=\alpha\rho-\zeta\rho^{\gamma}$, where the polytropic index $\gamma$ is uniquely determined by the regularization scheme. Within this framework, we obtain exact dynamical generalizations of several well-known regular black hole solutions, including the Hayward and Bardeen spacetimes, as particular cases corresponding to specific values of the polytropic parameters. Remarkably, the requirement that the equation of state remains coordinate independent imposes a universal constraint relating the regularization scale to the mass function, which in turn guarantees the existence of a regular de~Sitter core with a curvature scale independent of the black hole mass. Our results provide a unified analytic description of Hayward-like and Bardeen-like black holes emerging from gravitational collapse, offering a consistent effective-matter interpretation rooted in generalized polytropic matter.

#### Vacuum polarization in the Schwarzschild black hole with a global monopole

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate vacuum polarization on the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole carrying a global monopole. For a massless scalar field $\Psi$ in the Hartle-Hawking state and with arbitrary curvature coupling, we compute the renormalized vacuum expectation value $\langle \Psi^2 \rangle_{\textrm{ren}}$. The monopole produces a solid-angle deficit and makes the spacetime non-Ricci-flat. Working perturbatively in the monopole parameter $\eta$ and retaining terms through $O(\eta^2)$, we find that $\langle \Psi^2 \rangle_{\textrm{ren}}$ on the horizon splits into two contributions: a genuinely monopole-induced term evaluated at the horizon and the usual Schwarzschild result - with the event horizon radius modified by the presence of $\eta$. Our result parallels earlier analyses for Schwarzschild black holes pierced by a cosmic string.

#### Two types of quasinormal modes of Casadio-Fabbri-Mazzacurati brane-world black holes

 - **Abstract**
 Using the convergent Leaver method, we investigate the quasinormal modes of a massive scalar field propagating in the background of the Casadio--Fabbri--Mazzacurati brane-world black hole. We show that the spectrum exhibits two distinct types of modes, depending on their behavior as the field mass $\mu$ increases. In one class, the real oscillation frequency decreases and eventually approaches zero, while in the other the damping rate tends to vanish. When either the real or imaginary part of the frequency reaches zero, the corresponding mode disappears from the spectrum, and the first overtone replaces it.

#### Bayesian inference for tidal heating with extreme mass ratio inspirals

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) provide unique probes of near-horizon dissipation through the tidal heating. We present a full Bayesian analysis of tidal heating in equatorial eccentric EMRIs by performing injection-recovery studies and inferring posterior constraints on the reflectivity parameter $|\mathcal{R}|^2$ while sampling in the full EMRI parameter space. We find that in the strong-field regime the posterior uncertainties are smaller, indicating a stronger constraining capability on the tidal heating. Using two-year signals with an optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $\rho=50$, EMRIs can put bounds on $|\mathcal{R}|^2$ at the level of $10^{-3}$--$ 10^{-4}$ for a rapidly spinning central object. Moreover, we show that neglecting the tidal heating can induce clear systematic biases in the intrinsic parameters of the EMRI system. These results establish EMRIs as promising precision probes for detecting and constraining black hole event horizons.

 - **Abstract**
 We adopt the improved Reall-Santos method to obtain the leading-order perturbative correction of the quadratic curvature invariants to the on-shell Euclidean action of rotating anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes in general $D$ dimensions. The corresponding Gibbs free energy is a function of thermodynamic variables, temperature and angular velocities, which are unperturbed in this approach.

 - **Abstract**
 We construct the electron star solution in asymptotically global AdS spacetime, and investigate its stability properties, both locally under perturbations and globally with respect to the Reissner-Nordström black hole and thermal AdS metrics. We interpret the resulting phase diagram as that of a holographic metal confined to a finite volume. We identify a quantum critical point at finite chemical potential, around which the different phases are organized.

 - **Abstract**
 A generalization for the quantum information retrieval protocol recently illustrated by Verlinde and van der Heijden for evaporating black holes is provided to inclusions of type III von Neumann factors. The physical interest of such scenario arises in Quantum Field Theory, where local algebras are type III von Neumann algebras. The formula obtained can be easily interpreted in terms of the statistical dimension of superselection sectors in the case of black holes undergoing charge evaporation, thanks to the index-statistics theorem, leading to a thermodynamic interpretation. A constraint on the values of the index leads to a final remark about the quantization of the charge emitted by the black hole during the evaporation process.
