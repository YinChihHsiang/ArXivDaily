 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the imaging properties of spherically symmetric Konoplya-Zhidenko (KZ) black holes surrounded by geometrically thick accretion flows, adopting a phenomenological radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model and an analytical ballistic approximation accretion flow (BAAF) model. General relativistic radiative transfer is employed to compute synchrotron emission from thermal electrons and generate horizon-scale images. For the RIAF model, we analyze the dependence of image morphology on the deformation parameter, observing frequency, and flow dynamics. The photon ring and central dark region expand with increasing deformation parameter, with brightness asymmetries arising at high inclinations and depending on flow dynamics and emission anisotropy. The BAAF disk produces narrower rings and darker centers, while polarization patterns trace the brightness distribution and vary with viewing angle and deformation, revealing spacetime structure. These results demonstrate that intensity and polarization in thick-disk models provide probes of KZ black holes and near-horizon accretion physics.

 - **Abstract**
 For centuries, astronomers have discussed the possibility of inhabited worlds - from Herschel's 18th-century observations suggesting Mars may host life, to the systematic search for technosignatures that began in the 1960s using radio telescopes. Searching for artifacts in the solar system has received relatively little formal scientific interest and has faced significant technical and social challenges. Automated surveys and new observational techniques developed over the past decade now enable astronomers to survey parts of the sky for anomalous objects. We briefly describe four methods for detecting extraterrestrial artifacts and probes within the Solar System and then focus on demonstrating one of these. The first makes use of pre-Sputnik images to search for flashes from glinting objects. The second method makes use of space-borne telescopes to search for artificial objects. A third approach involves examining the reflectance spectra of objects in Earth orbit, in search of the characteristic reddening that may imply long-term exposure of metallic surfaces to space weathering. We focus here on a fourth approach, which involves using Earth's shadow as a filter when searching for optically luminous objects in near-Earth space. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept of this method by conducting two searches for transients in images acquired by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which has generated many repeated 30-second exposures of the same fields. In this way, we identified previously uncatalogued events at short angular separations from the center of the shadow, motivating more extensive searches using this technique. We conclude that the Earth's shadow presents a new and exciting search domain for near-Earth SETI.

 - **Abstract**
 JWST has revealed a population of red, compact, high-redshift (${z\sim3-10}$) objects referred to as ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs). These objects exhibit unusual spectral features reminiscent of stellar spectra with blackbody-like SEDs, large hydrogen Balmer breaks, Balmer line absorption, and classical stellar absorption features such as calcium H&K and the calcium triplet. Following the recent suggestion that these may be actively accreting direct-collapse black holes in the process of assembly, i.e. quasi-stars, we present evolutionary models of quasi-stars using our recently released, publicly available MESA-QUEST modeling framework. We compute a grid of models spanning a range of black hole masses and predict the luminosities, temperatures, surface gravities, and lifetimes of these objects. We find that these models lie along a Hayashi track once they hit their ``late-stage'' which constitutes the majority of their lives ($\sim 20$~Myr). We present scaling relations for estimating the mass of a quasi-star as a function of the bolometric luminosity, as well as the bolometric luminosity as a function of the effective temperature for the Hayashi track. The short lifetimes in tandem with the observed number density of LRDs imply the possibility that every supermassive black hole was once a quasi-star. We compare synthetic spectra of our quasi-star models to observations of LRDs, and show that these models are broadly capable of reproducing the continuum spectra of observed LRDs. These results indicate that quasi-stars are promising candidates for the origin of supermassive black holes via direct collapse in the early universe.

#### AION-1: Omnimodal Foundation Model for Astronomical Sciences

 - **Abstract**
 While foundation models have shown promise across a variety of fields, astronomy still lacks a unified framework for joint modeling across its highly diverse data modalities. In this paper, we present AION-1, a family of large-scale multimodal foundation models for astronomy. AION-1 integrates heterogeneous imaging, spectroscopic, and scalar data using a two-stage architecture: modality-specific tokenization followed by transformer-based masked modeling of cross-modal token sequences. The model is pretrained on five large-scale surveys: Legacy Survey, Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), and Gaia. These span more than 200 million observations of stars, galaxies, and quasars. With a single frozen encoder, AION-1 achieves strong results on a broad suite of downstream tasks, including galaxy and stellar property estimation, galaxy morphology classification, similarity-based retrieval, galaxy image segmentation, and spectral super-resolution. We release AION-1 model variants ranging from 300 M to 3.1 B parameters. Beyond astronomy, AION-1 provides a scalable blueprint for multimodal scientific foundation models that can seamlessly integrate noisy, instrument-specific observations. All code, tokenizers, pretrained weights, and a lightweight evaluation suite are released under an open-source license.

 - **Abstract**
 The gas mass fraction of galaxy groups and clusters is a key physical quantity for constraining the impact of feedback processes on large-scale structure. While several modern cosmological simulations use the gas fraction-halo mass relation to calibrate their feedback implementations, we note that this relation exhibits substantial intrinsic scatter whose origin has not been fully elucidated. Using the large-volume FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations, we examine the role of both central and satellite supermassive black holes (BHs) in shaping this scatter, probing higher halo masses than previously possible. For haloes with M500 < 10^13 Msun, we find that central BH mass correlates strongly and negatively with gas fraction, such that higher BH masses give rise to lower gas fractions at fixed halo mass, consistent with previous studies. Interestingly, however, for 10^13 Msun < M500 < 10^14.5 Msun the correlation reverses and becomes positive, with overmassive BHs residing in haloes with above-average gas fractions. By tracing progenitor BHs and haloes through cosmic time, we show that this behaviour is driven by the expulsion and subsequent re-accretion of halo gas, regulated by the timing of BH growth and feedback. Specifically, haloes that collapse earlier form BHs earlier, leading to earlier gas expulsion and re-accretion and a high gas fraction compared to haloes of the same present-day mass that formed later. Our results demonstrate that present-day scatter in the gas fraction-halo mass relation is strongly shaped by the early growth history of BHs and their haloes, a prediction that can be tested with future observational measurements.

 - **Abstract**
 After the third LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run, the number of detected binary black hole (BBH) mergers became sufficient to identify statistical features of the population. We explore how different prescriptions for the final fate of massive stars and key binary-evolution processes shape isolated binaries and their remnants. Using \textsc{sevn}, we evolved $10^{7}$ binaries across 15 metallicities, 3 core-collapse supernova models, 4 PPISN models, and 6 common-envelope (CE) prescriptions, for a total of 990 runs ($9.9 \times 10^{9}$ systems). Both single- and binary-star physics shape the BH mass distribution: single-star processes control the high-mass tail ($M_{\rm BH} \geq 45M_{\odot}$), while binary evolution produces pile-ups in specific intervals. In particular, the bump at $\sim 35 M_{\odot}$, often attributed to PPISNe, also emerges from binaries evolving only through stable mass transfer, without CE. Finally, we test a top-heavy IMF, finding it boosts merger numbers and alters the abundance of systems with a given primary BH mass.

#### Time-evolving diagnostic of the ionized absorbers in NGC 4051. I. High-resolution time-averaged spectroscopy

 - **Abstract**
 We present a high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic study of the Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 using two XMM-Newton high-resolution Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) observations. The spectra reveal three distinct layers of photoionized gas flowing outward from the central black hole: a low-ionization phase (LIP), a higher-ionization phase (HIP), and a high-velocity and high ionization phase (HVIP). Each absorber leaves characteristic imprints on the soft X-ray spectrum. While the LIP and HVIP are fully consistent with being in ionization equilibrium with the central radiation field over the course of the $\sim$250 ks spanned by the two observations, the HIP shows a significant change in ionization ($3.8\sigma$), suggesting non-equilibrium. By modeling the two spectra with our time-dependent photoionization code (TEPID), we constrain the density of the HIP gas to $\log n_{\rm H}=7.7^{+0.2}_{-0.9}$ and estimate its distance to be about $R=0.45^{+0.80}_{-0.09}$ light-days from the black hole, corresponding to $R=4000^{+7000}_{-800}$ gravitational radii. In contrast, the narrow soft X-ray emission lines remain constant, consistent with an origin in the more extended narrow-line region. Our results show the value of combining high-resolution and time-resolved spectroscopy to probe the structure, physical conditions, and variability of AGN outflows.

#### The Growth of the Central Black Holes in Quasi-stars

 - **Abstract**
 Observations by JWST have confirmed the presence of supermassive black holes (BHs) at redshifts $z\gtrsim10$, lending support to scenarios in which BHs experience rapid growth through intense gas accretion. Here we investigate the growth of a BH embedded at the center of a quasi-star, a theoretically predicted object formed via direct collapse. In a quasi-star, the central BH accretes at a highly super-Eddington rate, while the excess energy is transported outward by convection and radiated at approximately the Eddington luminosity of the entire star. We employ the open-source stellar evolution code \texttt{MESA} to construct quasi-star models and follow the time-dependent growth of the central BH under different prescriptions for the accretion rate at the inner boundary $R_i$, and further considering the effect of winds. For the case $R_i=NR_{\rm B}$, where $N$ is a constant and $R_{\rm B}$ is the Bondi radius corresponding to the mass of the BH and the gas infalling onto it, our models terminate when the BH mass reaches a critical value $M_{\mathrm{crit}}(N)=c_{s,i}^3/(12\sqrt{N^3G^3\pi\rho_i})$ (where $c_{s,i}$ and $\rho_i$ are the sound speed and density at $R_i$, respectively), a limit we also derive analytically. Models that feature an inner convective region matched to an outer adiabatic envelope exhibit BH growth up to approximately $M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_\star\simeq 0.33$, largely independent of the stellar mass $M_\star$ itself. This ratio is approximately preserved even in the presence of mass loss, as several properties of the model are independent of the quasi-star's total mass.

#### The implications of inflation for the last ACT

 - **Abstract**
 We explored a parameterized slow-roll inflationary model within the $\Lambda$CDM framework, utilizing a combination of data from Planck 2018, ACT DR6, DESI DR2, and BICEP/Keck 2018 (P-ACT-LB-BK18). Additionally, we incorporated the SH0ES prior on $H_0$ (P-ACT-LB-BK18-$H_0$) to analyze the model within the early dark energy (EDE) framework. While the model with a potential $V(\phi)\propto \phi^\alpha$ for small values of $\alpha$ still fits the data, the Starobinsky $R^2$ inflation falls outside the $2\sigma$ region. On the other hand, in a self-consistent quantum theory of gravity, higher-order corrections to $R$ are typically anticipated. In response, we proposed a non-perturbative exponential $f(R)$ inflation model, wherein the subleading corrections beyond $R^2$ including terms like $R^3$ or $R^4$. Using numerical calculations and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis with the P-ACT-LB-BK18 data set, we demonstrate that this model can align well with the ACT-preferred value of the scalar spectral index. Additionally, within the early dark energy (EDE) framework, it accommodates greater deviations from the original Starobinsky $R^2$ inflation model when incorporating the SH0ES prior on $H_0$.

#### Discovery of Repeating Transitions in 25 Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 The repeating changing-look active galactic nuclei (RCL AGNs) exhibit multiple appearances and disappearances of broad emission lines (BELs), whose underlying mechanism remains a puzzle. Expanding the sample of RCL AGNs is valuable for constraining the transition timescale and probing the accretion physics driving CL behaviors. This study aims to identify RCL AGNs using the multi-epoch spectroscopic data of confirmed CL AGNs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, supplemented with mid-infrared (MIR) light curves. Through selection criteria and visual inspection, we identify 25 RCL AGNs among 331 CL AGNs, corresponding to an occurrence rate of about $8\%$, indicating that repeated transitions are not rare in CL AGNs. Among the 25 RCL AGNs, 19 are newly identified, which significantly expands the known RCL AGN sample. Based on the spectra and densely sampled MIR light curves, we derive reliable turn-on transition timescales for 19 RCL AGNs, and find no significant correlation between the timescale and the black hole mass.

 - **Abstract**
 Winds from the accretion disk in tidal disruption events (TDEs) play a key role in determining the radiation of TDEs. The winds from the super-Eddington accretion phase in TDEs have recently been studied. However, properties of the winds from the sub-Eddington accretion disk in TDEs are not clear. We aim to investigate properties of winds from the circularized sub-Eddington accretion disk in TDEs. We study the line force driven accretion disk wind. We perform two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using the PLUTO code to study the line force driven wind from the circularized accretion disk around a $10^6$ solar mass black hole in TDEs. We find that although the disk has a very small size in TDEs, strong wind can be driven by line force when the disk have luminosity higher than $20\%$ of the Eddington luminosity. The maximum velocity of wind can be as high as $0.3$ times the speed of light. The kinematic power of wind is in the range of $1\%-6\%$ times the Eddington luminosity. Strong wind can be driven by line force from the thin disk around a $10^6$ solar mass black hole in TDEs. We briefly discuss the possible radio emission from the shock when the wind collides with the surrounding medium.

 - **Abstract**
 The space mission LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), scheduled for launch in 2035, aims to detect gravitational wave (GW) signals in the milli-Hz band. In the context of ESA Voyage 2050 Call for new mission concepts, other frequency ranges are explored by the Gravitational-Wave Space 2050 Working Group to conceive new proposals for a post-LISA space-based detector. In this work, we give a preliminary estimate of the observational potential of three mission designs proposed in the literature, namely $\mu$Ares, AMIGO and the Decihertz Observatory. The analysis framework includes astrophysical GW sources such as massive black hole binaries, extreme mass-ratio inspirals and compact binaries such as stellar black holes and white dwarfs. For each detector, we first present a consistent computation of the unresolved gravitational wave background (GWB) produced by the sum of all anticipated astrophysical populations, using an iterative subtraction algorithm. We then investigate which types of systems are the most appealing, by measuring the number of GW signals detected and exploring the source properties.

 - **Abstract**
 In the past years, a significant effort has been made with the scope of determining correlations, involving compact star properties, that are independent of the nuclear equation of state. Such universal relations are of utmost importance as they allow for the imposition of constraints on stellar properties without directly measuring them and they may also serve as a probe of General Relativity. In the present study, we investigated the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy of compact stars and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations. The main motivation was related to the fact that both of the aforementioned quantities might be measured in the occurrence of a supernova explosion. Interestingly, we found that there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the binding energy for both $f$ and $p_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter. The inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase transitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned quasi-universal relation.

#### Nonlinear Matter Power Spectrum from relativistic $N$-body Simulations: $Λ_{\rm s}$CDM versus $Λ$CDM

 - **Abstract**
 We present relativistic $N$-body simulations of a $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM - sign-switching cosmological constant (CC) - scenario under general relativity and compare its nonlinear matter power spectrum to $\Lambda$CDM at ${z = 15,\,2,\,1,\,0}$, using best-fit parameters from Planck-only and a combined ''full'' dataset. During the AdS-like CC ($\Lambda_{\rm s}<0$) phase, prior to the transition redshift $z_\dagger$, reduced Hubble friction dynamically enhances the growth of perturbations; after the switch, with dS-like CC ($\Lambda_{\rm s}>0$), the larger late-time expansion rate partly suppresses, but does not erase, the earlier amplification. Consequently, the ratio $P_{\Lambda_{\rm s}\rm CDM}/P_{\Lambda\rm CDM}$ exhibits a pronounced, redshift-dependent shape feature: a crest peaking at ${\sim 20-25\%}$ around ${k \simeq 1-3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$ near the transition, which then migrates to larger physical scales and persists to ${z = 0}$ as a robust ${\sim 15-20\%}$ uplift at ${k \simeq 0.6-1.0\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$. These wavenumbers correspond to group/poor-cluster environments and lie within the sensitivity range of weak lensing, galaxy-galaxy lensing, cluster counts, and tSZ power, providing a concrete, falsifiable target that cannot be mimicked by a scale-independent change in $\sigma_8$ or $S_8$. The timing (earlier for Planck-only, later for the full dataset) and the amplitude of the crest align with the ''cosmic noon'' epoch (${z \simeq 1-2}$), offering a gravitational prior for the observed peak in the cosmic star-formation rate.

 - **Abstract**
 In cosmology, emulators play a crucial role by providing fast and accurate predictions of complex physical models, enabling efficient exploration of high-dimensional parameter spaces that would be computationally prohibitive with direct numerical simulations. Symbolic emulators have emerged as promising alternatives to numerical approaches, delivering comparable accuracy with significantly faster evaluation times. While previous symbolic emulators were limited to relatively narrow prior ranges, we expand these to cover the parameter space relevant for current cosmological analyses. We introduce approximations to hypergeometric functions used for the $\Lambda$CDM comoving distance and linear growth factor which are accurate to better than 0.001% and 0.05%, respectively, for all redshifts and for $\Omega_{\rm m} \in [0.1, 0.5]$. We show that integrating symbolic emulators into a Dark Energy Survey-like $3\times2$pt analysis produces cosmological constraints consistent with those obtained using standard numerical methods. Our symbolic emulators offer substantial improvements in speed and memory usage, demonstrating their practical potential for scalable, likelihood-based inference.

#### A Detailed Chemical Analysis of the Red Giant Orbiting the Black Hole $Gaia$ BH3: From Lithium to Thorium

 - **Abstract**
 Preliminary astrometric data from the fourth data release of the $Gaia$ mission revealed a 33 M$_{\odot}$ dark companion to a metal-poor red giant star, deemed $Gaia$ BH3. This system hosts both the most massive known stellar-origin black hole and the lowest-metallicity star yet discovered in orbit around a black hole. The formation pathway for this peculiar stellar-black hole binary system has yet to be determined, with possible production mechanisms that include isolated binary evolution and dynamical capture. The chemical composition of the stellar companion in $Gaia$ BH3 (hereafter \bhstar) can help constrain the potential formation mechanisms of this system. Here, we conduct the most comprehensive chemical analysis of \bhstar\ to date using high resolution spectra obtained by the Tull Coudé Spectrograph on the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory to constrain potential formation mechanisms. We derived 29 elemental abundances ranging from lithium to thorium and find that \bhstar\ is an $\alpha$-enriched ([$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.41), r-I neutron-capture star ([Eu/Fe] = 0.57). We conclude that \bhstar\ shows no chemical peculiarities (defined as deviations from the expected chemical pattern of an r-I halo red giant) in any elements, which is in alignment with both the dynamical capture and isolated binary evolution formation scenarios. With an upper limit detection on Th, we use the Th/Eu chronometer to place limits on the cosmochronometric age of this system. These observations lay the groundwork for heavy-element chemical analysis for subsequent black hole and low-metallicity stellar binaries that will likely be found in $Gaia$ DR4.

#### Linking Electron Density with Elevated Star Formation Activity from $z=0$ to $z=10$

 - **Abstract**
 The interstellar medium (ISM) in high-redshift galaxies exhibits significantly higher electron densities ($n_{\rm e}$) than in the local universe. To investigate the origin of this trend, we analyze a sample of 9590 centrally star-forming galaxies with stellar masses greater than $10^9\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $0.01 < z < 0.04$, selected from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1. We derive electron densities from the [S~II]~$\lambda\lambda6716,6731$ doublet, measuring values of $n_{\rm e} = 30$-$400~{\rm cm^{-3}}$ at $z \approx 0$. We find a tight correlation between $n_{\rm e}$ and the star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), which is well described by a broken power law. Above a threshold of $\log(\Sigma_{\rm SFR} / M_\odot\,{\rm yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}) \ge -1.46$, the relation follows $n_{\rm e} = (233 \pm 13)\,\Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.49 \pm 0.02}$. Below this threshold, $n_{\rm e}$ remains approximately constant at $44 \pm 3~{\rm cm^{-3}}$. Remarkably, this relation remains consistent with measurements of galaxies at $z = 0.9$-$10.2$. By converting the observed redshift evolution of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ into $n_{\rm e}$ evolution through our $n_{\rm e}$-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation, we obtain $n_{\rm e} = 40(1+z)^{1.4}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$, consistent with previous direct observations. The $n_{\rm e}$-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation likely arises because the high $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, fueled by dense cold gas or elevated efficiency, enhances radiative and mechanical feedback and produces dense ionized gas whose electron densities are further regulated by ambient pressure. We conclude that the redshift evolution of $n_{\rm e}$ primarily reflects the evolution of cold gas density and star formation activity over cosmic time.

 - **Abstract**
 We examine single-field inflationary models for the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By analyzing the latest observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)~\cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim}, we demonstrate that the observed preference for positive running ($\alpha_s$) of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ imposes significant restrictions on the parameter space of ultra slow roll scenarios (USR). This tension becomes progressively pronounced for more massive PBHs, posing substantial challenges for USR models to yield a detectable PBH abundance, especially in the mass range probed by ongoing and future gravitational-wave experiments such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). However, this discrepancy is minimal for asteroid-mass PBHs, which are still capable of feasibly constituting the entirety of dark matter (DM). To numerically probe the six-dimensional parameter space of polynomial models, we adapted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to efficiently scan over the space of viable models. Our results further indicate that, in non-minimally coupled polynomial inflation, a viable cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is best obtained at an inflection point for which second-order slow-roll approximation is necessary for precise CMB predictions.

 - **Abstract**
 Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are believed to be thermonuclear explosions of white dwarf (WD) stars, but their progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms are still unclear. Here we focus on double degenerate systems, where two WDs are interacting, and on the double detonation mechanism, where a detonation of a helium shell triggers a detonation of the carbon-oxygen core of the primary WD. We take the results from three-dimensional SN simulations of Pakmor et al 2022 (arXiv:2203.14990) and carry them into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, until 1500 yr after the explosion. We reveal signatures of the SN imprinted in the SNR morphology. We confirm the impact of a companion on the SNR: its presence induces a conical shadow in the ejecta, that is long lived. Its intersection with the shocked shell is visible in projection as a ring, an ellipse, or a bar, depending on the orientation. New, we test the case of a nested explosion model, in which the explosion of the primary induces the secondary to also explode. As the explosion of the secondary WD is weaker only the primary outer ejecta interact with the ambient medium and form the main SNR shell. The secondary inner ejecta collide with the reverse shock, which enhances the density and thus the X-ray emissivity. The composition at the points of impact is peculiar, since what is revealed are the outer layers from the inner ejecta. This effect can be probed with spatially-resolved X-ray spectroscopy of young SNRs.

 - **Abstract**
 The fourth gravitational wave transient catalog~(GWTC-4) has enabled empirical probes of the theorized pair-instability gap in the higher end of the binary black hole~(BBH) mass-spectrum. In this letter, using flexibly parametrized models, we show that at present there is no evidence of a sharp drop-off in the spectrum of black hole masses near $~40-50M_{\odot}$. We simultaneously characterize the transition in the distribution of BBH mass-ratios, effective aligned and effective precessing spins using our flexible models. From the transitions in our inferred spin and mass-ratio distributions, we find that the high-mass broad-spin sub-population has a significant fraction~($52^{+18}_{-23}\%$) of systems with mass ratios in the range $0.6-1$. This suggests that alternatives to the hypothesis of 2G+1G hierarchical systems dominating BBH formation above $\sim 40-50 M_{\odot}$ are more consistent with the GWTC-4 detection sample. By comparing with the predictions of star cluster simulations, we further show that contributions from (2G+2G) systems are not abundant enough to alleviate this discrepancy. We also demonstrate the effects of strong model assumptions on this inference, which can lead to biased astrophysical interpretation from restricted priors. We note that our results do not exclude that a high-mass gap may be identified as our sample size increases. We constrain the lower bound on the location of a possible PISN cutoff still allowed within measurement uncertainties to be $(57^{+17}_{-10}M_{\odot})$ and discuss its implications on the S factor of $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16}O$ at 300 kev.

 - **Abstract**
 We use an approximation of the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli potential, known as Pöschl-Teller, to exactly compute the time-domain Green function of black hole perturbations in this simplified model, taking into account all causality conditions. We find the existence of an additional early times piece in the Green function, contributing to new exponentially growing modes just before the signal interacts with the maximum of the potential. The waveform itself is decomposed as an instantaneous piece traveling exactly on the light-cones of the Green function and a historical piece depending on the past trajectory of the system inside the light-cone. We also study redshift modes and show that the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli Green function is regular at their frequency, with no zero nor pole.

#### Amplification of new physics in the quasinormal mode spectrum of highly-rotating black holes

 - **Abstract**
 We show that perturbatively-small higher-derivative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action can lead to order-one modifications of the quasinormal mode spectrum of near-extremal Kerr black holes. The spectrum of such black holes contains zero-damping modes (ZDMs) and damped modes (DMs), with the latter only existing when the ratio $\mu=m/(l+1/2)$ is below a critical value $\bar{\mu}_{\rm cr}\approx 0.744$. Thus, this value represents a "phase boundary" that separates a region with both ZDMs and DMs and a region with only ZDMs. We find that the modes lying close to the phase boundary are very sensitive to modifications of GR, as their lifetimes receive corrections inversely proportional to their distance to the boundary. We link this growth of the corrections to a modification of the critical point $\bar{\mu}_{\rm cr}$, which can lead to a change in the number of DMs and produce order-one effects in the spectrum. We show that these large effects can take place in a regime in which the higher-derivative expansion remains under control. We also perform an exact analysis of the modification of the phase boundary for lower $(l,m)$ modes and pinpoint those that are most sensitive to corrections. Our results indicate that spectroscopy of highly-rotating black holes is by far the most powerful way to search for new physics in ringdown signals.

#### Gravity with higher-curvature terms and second-order field equations: $f(\mathcal{R})$ meets Gauss-Bonnet

 - **Abstract**
 General Relativity is expected to break down in the high-curvature regime. Beyond an effective field theory treatment with higher-order operators, it is important to identify consistent theories with higher-curvature terms at the nonperturbative level. Two well-studied examples are $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity and Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity. The former shares the same vacuum solutions as General Relativity, including black holes, while the latter suffers from well-posedness issues due to quadratic curvature terms in the strong-coupling regime. We show that combining these two theories leads to genuinely new phenomena beyond their simple superposition. The resulting framework falls outside Horndeski's class, as it can be recast as a gravitational theory involving two nonminimally coupled scalar fields with nontrivial mutual interactions. This construction naturally extends EdGB gravity to include arbitrary higher-curvature terms, providing a versatile setting to address fundamental questions. Focusing on quadratic and quartic corrections, we find that: (i) black holes are modified by $f(\mathcal{R})$ terms, unlike the case without Gauss-Bonnet interactions; (ii) the resulting solutions retain the qualitative nonperturbative features of EdGB black holes with certain couplings, such as a minimum mass and multiple branches; (iii) a nontrivial mechanism suppresses the divergence of the Ricci scalar in the black-hole interior; (iv) still, even with quartic corrections, the singularity structure and elliptic regions inside the horizon remain similar to those of pure EdGB gravity. This suggests that, at the nonperturbative level, the theory's ill-posedness cannot be resolved by adding individual higher-order terms. This conjecture could be tested by studying the nonlinear dynamics, which remains governed by second-order field equations.

 - **Abstract**
 Light scalar particles arise naturally in many extensions of the Standard Model and are well-motivated dark matter candidates. Gravitational interactions near black holes can trigger the growth of dense scalar configurations that, if sustained during inspiral, alter binary dynamics and imprint signatures on gravitational-wave signals. Detecting such effects would provide a novel probe of fundamental physics and dark matter. Here we develop a semi-analytic waveform model for binaries in scalar environments, validated against numerical relativity simulations, and apply it in a Bayesian analysis of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog. Our results set physically meaningful upper bounds on scalar environments around compact binaries. When superradiance priors are included, we find tentative evidence for such an environment in GW190728 with $\ln B_{\mathrm{vac}}^{\mathrm{env}} \approx 3.5$, which would correspond to the existence of a light scalar field with mass $\sim 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$.

 - **Abstract**
 This work presents and investigates novel traversable wormhole solutions within the framework of Asymptotically Safe Gravity (ASG), sourced by a dark matter halo modeled by the Dekel--Zhao density profile. The scale-dependent gravitational coupling $G(k)$, derived from the ASG renormalization group flow in the infrared regime, is incorporated directly into the field equations, providing a consistent description of quantum gravitational corrections even at astrophysical scales. The combined effects of the running coupling (parameterized by $\xi$) and the dark matter characteristics determine the geometric structure and physical viability of the wormhole. The solutions satisfy the flare-out and asymptotic flatness conditions within restricted parameter domains, exhibiting enhanced curvature near the throat due to ASG corrections. Null Energy Conditions are necessarily violated at the throat, and stability analysis based on the adiabatic sound speed as well as the modified Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equation reveal that quantum effects from ASG counteract the destabilizing influence of dark matter. Phenomenologically, the wormhole shadow radius increases nearly linearly with $\xi$, lying within the Event Horizon Telescope bounds for Sgr~A$^*$ when $\xi/M \simeq 0.8--0.9$, thus suggesting that ASG-corrected wormholes may represent observable signatures of quantum gravity in the strong-field regime.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we discuss the spontaneous scalarization of Hayward black holes in Einstein-nonlinear electromagnetic-scalar gravity. Taking into account the tachyonic instability, we obtain scalarized charged black holes (SCBHs) with quadratic (1-$\alpha\varphi^2$) and exponential ($e^{-\alpha \varphi^2}$) couplings, respectively. Moreover, these SCBHs can be labelled by the number of $n = 0, 1, 2,...$, where $n = 0$ is called the fundamental black hole and $n = 1, 2,...$ denote the $n$-excited black holes. We recover that the $n = 0$ branch for both couplings is stable against radial perturbations. This stability shows that this branch can be used for further observational implications.

 - **Abstract**
 This thesis is situated within the context of quantum gravity, broadly understood as any effort to explore the interplay between gravitation and the quantum realm, without necessarily requiring the quantization of the gravitational field itself. We focus on emergent theories, particularly those in which the causal structure and geometric concepts underlying the gravitational field in General Relativity are not fundamental but instead arise from more basic underlying degrees of freedom. Our attention is directed toward emergent approaches inspired by condensed matter physics. Rather than developing a full-fledged emergent theory and analyzing its detailed consequences, this work offers a concise roadmap of analyses and reflections relevant to emergent frameworks, without committing to any specific model. The thesis is divided into two parts, reflecting the distinct tools and analyses employed in each. The first addresses fundamental and conceptual aspects of emergent theories, focusing on the role of background structures, both regarding their implications for the theory and their constructive relevance. The second assumes the absence of singularities and horizons, a feature often expected in emergent frameworks, though the analyses remain agnostic and independent of specific theoretical commitments.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the geodesic structure and observable properties of asymptotically flat regular black holes sourced by a phantom scalar field characterized by a scalar charge $A$. This parameter removes the central singularity and continuously deforms the Schwarzschild geometry. The equations of motion for test particles and photons are derived, and the resulting null geodesics are analyzed, including the deflection of light, gravitational time delay, and redshift, in order to constrain $A$ using classical Solar System tests. These observations impose stringent limits on the scalar charge, confirming that $A$ must remain extremely small in the weak-field regime to ensure full consistency with general relativity. In the strong-field regime, we compute the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ associated with the photon sphere and establish its exact relations with the critical impact parameter $\mathcal{B}_u$ and the angular size of the shadow $\alpha_{\mathrm{sh}}$, given by $\mathcal{B}_u = 1/|\lambda|$ and $\alpha_{\mathrm{sh}} = 1/(r_{0}|\lambda|)$. These correspondences reveal that the dynamical instability of null circular orbits governs the optical appearance of the black hole. Our results show that increasing $A$ reduces the instability of photon trajectories and enlarges the angular size of the shadow, indicating that the regularization scale leaves a distinct observational imprint on the geometry of regular black holes. In addition, constraints derived from Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87* and Sgr A* further restrict the allowed range of the scalar charge, reinforcing the consistency of the model with current astrophysical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the existence of cosmological black holes by analyzing the properties of trapping horizons in detail, based on Hayward's formalism of future outer and past inner trapping horizons, in several dynamical spacetimes embedded in an expanding universe. Through a detailed examination of the McVittie, Culetu, and Sultana--Dyer metrics, as well as the generalized Glass--Mashhoon solution, we evaluate the existence and characteristics of trapping horizons and energy conditions. The Glass--Mashhoon solution provides an analytical model for spherical stellar collapse. However, it is shown that, as long as certain conditions are satisfied, it lacks suitable future outer trapping horizons, meaning it does not represent a cosmological black hole. As a result, the McVittie class of solutions also fails to describe a cosmological black hole. Conversely, the Culetu and Sultana--Dyer spacetimes can describe a cosmological black hole in the matter-dominated early universe, provided that the relevant energy conditions are satisfied.

 - **Abstract**
 Black holes with sufficiently large initial charge and mass will Hawking-evaporate towards the extremal limit. The emission slows as the temperature approaches zero, but still reaches the point where a single Hawking quantum would make the object superextremal, removing the horizon. We take this semiclassical prediction at face value and ask: When the emission occurs, what is revealed? Using a model of thin-shell collapse with subsequent accretion/evaporation by a null flux of ingoing positive/negative energy (charged Vaidya spacetime glued to a flat interior), we find two possible outcomes: (i) For shells that are initially very tightly bound, a timelike singularity forms and later appears; or (ii) for unbound or modestly bound shells, the matter re-emerges as a null shell that expands to infinity. This expanding remnant has been bathed in the ingoing Hawking quanta during evaporation and presumably carries correlations with the outgoing quanta, offering the attractive possibility of studying information paradox issues in a setup where spacetime curvatures are globally small, so that quantum gravity is not required. Even for ordinary black holes that evaporate down to the Planck size, we propose a radical new scenario for the interior: rather than forming a singularity, the collapsing matter settles onto an \textit{outgoing} null trajectory \textit{inside} the horizon for the entirety of evaporation.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the quasi--normal modes of a massless scalar field in the background of an Ayón--Beato--García black hole surrounded by quintessence, using the Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM) with $30$ iterations. The results show that the real part of the frequencies increases with the charge parameter $g^2$, while the absolute value of the imaginary part decreases as $g^2$ increases. In contrast, both the real part and the absolute value of the imaginary part decrease as the quintessence parameter $c$ increases. These trends are observed for both values of the quintessence state parameter, $\omega_q =-2/3$ and $\omega_q =-4/9$; however, the effects become more pronounced as $\omega_q$ approaches $-1$. The quasi--normal frequencies tend to have finite values, which could facilitate their observational detection. Moreover, the presence of quintessence leads to a slower damping of the perturbations.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the correspondence between highly excited strings and black holes in the presence of angular momentum. At fixed imaginary angular velocity $\nu$, we show that free strings exhibit a Hagedorn instability, explained, as in Atick-Witten, by a thermal-winding mode turning tachyonic. This allows us to determine the exact Hagedorn temperature $\beta_H(\nu)$ for bosonic, type II, and heterotic strings. Using the effective field theory for the thermal-winding mode around the $\nu$-dependent background, we find a novel `rotating string star' saddle (perturbatively in the angular velocity) and study its properties. This configuration describes a self-gravitating bound state of highly excited rotating strings. As in the non-rotating case, the saddle is qualitatively shown to interpolate between the rotating strings phase and a rotating black hole. We also comment on the implications of these results for anti-de Sitter space.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the evolution of charged, asymptotically de Sitter black holes close to the cold extremal branch of the phase space. We consider black hole sizes that are parametrically smaller than both their inverse temperature and the cosmological horizon. Unlike flat space, charged de Sitter black holes do not evolve towards extremality, but rather towards a thermal equilibrium with the cosmological horizon. In the low-temperature regime, the near-horizon physics can be effectively captured by a one-dimensional Schwarzian theory. This is coupled to the far-horizon de Sitter quantum field theory. Incorporating the thermal nature of the cosmological horizon, we compute the quantum energy transfer through uncharged massless scalar particles. The results significantly differ from Hawking's thermal predictions. Black holes that are hotter than the cosmological horizon emit energy at a rate lower than their asymptotically flat counterparts. Whereas much colder ones absorb energy at a nearly constant rate.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a quantum quadratic gravity inflationary scenario that can accommodate the new cosmological constraints, which have disfavored Starobinsky inflation. The theory is asymptotically free in the ultraviolet, but 1-loop running is found to dynamically lead to slow-roll inflation toward the infrared. When a large number of matter fields contribute to the beta functions, the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio can be phenomenologically viable. We find that as inflation ends, the theory approaches its strong coupling regime and general relativity must emerge, as an effective field theory, as the universe must reheat and enter its standard radiation era. In order to avoid strong coupling, a minimum tensor-to-scalar ratio of 0.01 is predicted for this theory. Our framework offers a laboratory for connecting a concrete ultraviolet completion (quantum quadratic gravity) with inflationary dynamics, reheating, and precise cosmological observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The circuit complexity of time-evolved pure quantum states grows linearly in time for an exponentially long time. This behavior has been proven in certain models, is conjectured to hold for generic quantum many-body systems, and is believed to be dual to the long-time growth of black hole interiors in AdS/CFT. Achieving a similar understanding for mixed states remains an important problem. In this work, we study the circuit complexity of time-evolved subsystems of pure quantum states. We find that for greater-than-half subsystem sizes, the complexity grows linearly in time for an exponentially long time, similarly to that of the full state. However, for less-than-half subsystem sizes, the complexity rises and then falls, returning to low complexity as the subsystem equilibrates. Notably, the transition between these two regimes occurs sharply at half system size. We use holographic duality to map out this picture of subsystem complexity dynamics and rigorously prove the existence of the sharp transition in random quantum circuits. Furthermore, we use holography to predict features of complexity growth at finite temperature that lie beyond the reach of techniques based on random quantum circuits. In particular, at finite temperature, we argue for an additional sharp transition at a critical less-than-half subsystem size. Below this critical value, the subsystem complexity saturates nearly instantaneously rather than exhibiting a rise and fall. This novel phenomenon, as well as an analogous transition above half system size, provides a target for future studies based on rigorous methods.
