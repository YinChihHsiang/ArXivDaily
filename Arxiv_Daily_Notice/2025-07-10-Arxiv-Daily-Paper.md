 - **Abstract**
 Using the MOPTOP polarimeter on the 2-meter Liverpool Telescope, we conducted a monitoring campaign targeting three optically-discovered TDEs (AT2024bgz, AT2024pvu, and AT2024wsd) and two Bowen flares in AGN (AT2020afhd and AT2019aalc). The three thermal TDEs showed low intrinsic polarization levels ($\Delta P \approx 0$-$6\%$) with stable polarization angles. The Bowen flares also showed variable polarization degree ($ \Delta P \approx 0$-$8\%$), but significant polarization angle variability: AT2020afhd exhibited a $\Delta \theta = 83 \pm 8 \,^\circ$ shift at 150 days post-optical peak, while the AT2019aalc displayed quasi-periodic swings of $\Delta \theta \approx 40 \, ^\circ$ amplitude starting 190 days after peak brightness. The TDEs of this study are well described by models invoking rapid disk formation and reprocessed emission from optically thick outflows, whereas the Bowen flares reveal more complex reprocessing geometries, potentially consistent with TDEs occurring in AGN gas-rich environments. We find that moderate polarization is observed at later times for TDEs with low-Eddington ratios and highly extended photospheres. This implies that, as the accretion level declines, we expect more asymmetric reprocessing layers along a given viewing angle. Since the outflow density and velocity depend sensitively on the inclination angle, we expect TDEs with low-Eddington ratios and highly extended photospheres to exhibit varying levels of polarization. The polarization of AT2019aalc (Seyfert 1) hints at a clumpy, asymmetric outflow and the presence of a tilted, precessing accretion disk, while the polarization of AT2020afhd (AGN type 2) is consistent with the detection of a scattered light echo.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we address two major questions raised by recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of the young Universe, namely: 1) what are the seed initial masses, and how rapidly have supermassive black holes (BHs) with masses of 1e6-1e8Msun grown in active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosted by very young galaxies? 2) What are the plausible explanations for the super solar abundances of nitrogen in a fraction of young galaxies at high redshift, both with and without evidence of a massive central black hole? We focus mainly on the system GS3073. This system shows an exceptionally large log(N/O)=+0.42(+0.13/-0.10) in the gas close to the AGN. We show here that this abundance is consistent with the composition of gas ejected from massive asymptotic giant branch stars. Moreover, this system shows chemical properties matching those expected at a specific point of the evolution of the abundances in the extreme populations of the former nuclear star cluster wCentauri (wCen). This analogy, along with the N/O, C/O and Fe/O abundances in GS3073, lead to an estimate of an age range of 270-440 Myr for this object, much smaller than the redshift (z=5.5) age of about 1 Gyr. We also adopt the same criteria to estimate an age for GNz11. These two determinations constrain the BH mass versus age relation: accretion on the BH must proceed at intermittent superEddington rates in the first phases, and at a much lower rate after the first half gigayear of life of the Universe. The intermittency of accretion is also a fundamental requirement to allow the formation of the extreme (N rich, O depleted, He rich) populations today observed in wCen for a large range of metallicities.
#### Growing the Intermediate-mass Black Hole in Omega Centauri

 - **Abstract**
 The recent detection of fast-moving stars in the core of Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen), the most massive globular cluster (GC) in the Milky Way, has provided strong evidence for the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). As $\omega$ Cen, is likely the accreted nucleus of a dwarf galaxy, this IMBH also represents a unique opportunity to study BH seeding mechanisms and their potential role in the formation of supermassive BHs. We present Monte Carlo $N$-body models of $\omega$ Cen with detailed treatments for the loss cone dynamics involving stars, binaries, and compact objects. Starting with BH seeds of $500-5000 \, M_{\odot}$ (consistent with runaway collisions of massive stars), our cluster models grow IMBHs with masses of $\sim50{,}000 \, M_{\odot}$ after 12 Gyr, while successfully reproducing the present-day surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles of $\omega$ Cen. We find a population of fast stars similar to those observed in the core of $\omega$ Cen, with the fastest stars originating from binaries that were tidally disrupted by the IMBH. The IMBH growth is primarily driven by mergers with $30-40 \, M_{\odot}$ BHs, suggesting a present-day IMBH-BH merger rate of $\sim(4-8)\times10^{-8}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$ in $\omega$ Cen-like GCs. Our models also predict a similar rate of tidal disruption events ($\sim5\times10^{-8}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$) which, depending on the frequency of $\omega$ Cen-like GCs per galaxy, may represent anywhere from $0.1\%$ to $10\%$ of the observed TDE rate.

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the nature and evolution of dark energy (DE) is a central challenge in modern cosmology. In this work, we explore the constraining power of bright standard sirens -- gravitational wave (GW) events with electromagnetic counterparts - for probing the DE equation of state as function of redshift. Focusing on future GW observations from next-generation ground-based GW detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, we perform a comprehensive analysis using simulated binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) events over five years of observation with a $75\%$ duty cycle. We consider three broad classes of DE models: (i) phenomenological parametrizations, specifically the Barboza-Alcaniz extension to the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder model; (ii) physically motivated scalar field scenarios, specifically hilltop quintessence; and (iii) evolving dark matter setup in which the matter density evolves as $(1+z)^{3+\alpha}$. For each case, we jointly infer the Hubble constant $H_0$ and model-specific DE parameters from the observed GW luminosity distances and spectroscopic redshifts. Our results demonstrate that bright sirens alone can yield competitive and independent constraints on the time evolution of DE indicating that multi-messenger cosmology has the potential to test a wide range of DE theories, bridging phenomenological and physically motivated models, and paving the way for precision cosmology in the era of GW astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 The central 5 parsecs of our Galactic Center is rich in various molecular tracers. The region is observed to be hot, highly ionized, and volatile, resulting in complex chemistry and kinematics. Countless molecular observations of the central region orbiting the central super-massive black hole Sgr A* have revealed a stable grouping of clouds with a disk-like structure known as the circumnuclear disk (CND) orbiting Sgr A* between 1.5 and 3 pc. The CND houses the densest population of gas outside the ionized streams in the minispiral falling onto Sgr A*. However, the small-scale kinematics of the clouds and gas are poorly understood in this region. In this paper, we report single dish SiO (1-0) observations of the central 5 pc surrounding Sgr A* taken with the Green Bank Telescope. Most of the SiO (1-0) traces the southern streamer and Sgr A East-neither of which are associated with the CND. However, one region in the CND, known as the NE Arm, shows high-intensity SiO emission unlike in the rest of the CND, indicating the NE Arm as a candidate region of either cloud-cloud collision or early star formation. Further high resolution observations of the region are needed to distinguish between the two scenarios.
#### Optically Overluminous Tidal Disruption Events: Outflow Properties and Implications for Extremely Relativistic Disruptions

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies suggest that tidal disruption events (TDEs) with off-axis jets may manifest as optically overluminous events. To search for jet signatures at late times, we conducted radio observations of eight such optically overluminous ($M_{g, \rm peak} < -20.8$ mag) TDEs with the Very Large Array. We detect radio counterparts in four events. The observed radio luminosities ($L_{\rm 6 GHz} \sim 10^{38}$--$10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$) are two orders of magnitude lower than those of on-axis jetted TDEs, and we find no evidence for off-axis jets within rest-frame time of 3 yrs. Two of them (AT2022hvp and AT2021aeou) exhibit evolving radio emission, consistent with synchrotron emission from non-relativistic outflows launched near the time of first optical light. Two events (AT2020ysg and AT2020qhs) show no statistically significant variability, which can be attributed to either non-relativistic outflows or pre-existing active galactic nuclei. Compared to a control sample of fainter TDEs with $M_{g, \rm peak} > -20.5$ mag observed at similar rest-frame timescales ($t_{\rm rest} ~ 1.5$\,yr), our sample shows systematically more luminous radio emission, suggesting that optically overluminous TDEs may launch more powerful prompt non-relativistic outflows. We speculate that strong general relativistic effects near high-mass black holes ($M_{\rm BH} ~ 10^8\,M_\odot$) may play a key role. These findings motivate further investigation into the nature of relativistic disruptions around massive black holes and the physical conditions necessary for jet formation.
#### Power Law Plateau Inflation and Primary Gravitational Waves in the light of ACT

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate Power-Law Plateau (PLP) inflation in standard gravity and its consistency with ACT DR6 data. While many inflationary models, including the Starobinsky inflation, are disfavored by ACT observations, the PLP potential remains viable across a broad range of its parameters. Then, the dynamics of the reheating phase are investigated, where we mainly focus on the reheating temperature and its relationship with the inflationary phase and primordial gravitational waves. Incorporating the overproduction of the primordial gravitational waves can affect the effective number of relativistic species during the bounce. The constraint data on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ can impose a lower bound on the reheating temperature. This constraint will be more efficient for a stiff equation of state. It is determined that for $\omega_{re} > 0.58$, this constraint would be efficient. Combining the result of the reheating temperature and the inflationary phase, it is concluded that to have both a viable result standing in $1\sigma$ of ACT DR6 and also to satisfy the reheating lower bound, the total number of e-folds during the inflationary phase should be $N_k \lesssim 62$. Higher e-folds of expansion result in a reheating temperature below the bound, which is disfavored. Finally, for the constraint values of the reheating temperature, the energy spectrum of the gravitational waves has been explored. The results indicate that there is a higher chance of detection for lower reheating temperatures and higher reheating equation of state.

 - **Abstract**
 The detection of transient phenomena such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), stellar flares, novae, and supernovae, alongside novel cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves, has transformed astrophysics in recent years. Maximizing the discovery potential of multi-messenger and multi-wavelength follow-up observations, as well as serendipitous detections, requires a tool that rapidly compiles and contextualizes relevant information for each new event. We present Astro-COLIBRI, an advanced platform designed to meet this challenge. Astro-COLIBRI integrates a public RESTful API, real-time databases, a cloud-based alert system, and user-friendly clients (a website and mobile apps for iOS and Android). It processes astronomical alerts from multiple streams in real time, filtering them based on user-defined criteria and placing them in their multi-wavelength and multi-messenger context. The platform offers intuitive data visualization, a quick summary of relevant event properties, and an assessment of observing conditions at numerous observatories worldwide. We here describe its architecture, data resources, and main functionalities. We highlight the automatic collection of photometric data from a variety of large scale optical surveys, a recently added feature that significantly improves the capabilities of the Astro-COLIBRI platform.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we derive upper limits on the physical energy-density fraction today of cosmological gravitational waves, denoted by $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}$, by combining \emph{Planck} \& ACT \& SPT CMB data with DESI BAO data. In the standard cosmological model, we establish 95\% CL upper limits of $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ for adiabatic initial conditions and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 2.7 \times 10^{-7}$ for homogeneous initial conditions. In light of dynamical dark energy, we get $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 7.2 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} < 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous). We also project the sensitivity achievable with LiteBIRD \& CMB Stage-IV measurements of CMB and CSST observations of BAO, forecasting 68\% CL uncertainties of $\sigma = 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\sigma = 0.9 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous) for ${\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}}$. The constraints provide critical benchmarks for exploring the cosmological origins of gravitational waves within the frequency band $f \gtrsim 10^{-15}$\,Hz and potentially enable joint analysis with direct gravitational-wave detection sensitive to this regime.

 - **Abstract**
 IceCube has detected a diffuse flux of high-energy neutrinos, whose origin still remains uncertain. Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been proposed as plausible sources of neutrinos. Candidate sources include AT2019dsg, which is likely a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), and AT2019dfr, an AGN flare. Both present delayed emission in the IR band with respect to the optical signal. This emission can be interpreted as the reprocessing of X-rays to optical light of the flare by dust located in a torus around the SMBH. An additional study using an optically detected sample of 63 accretion flares revealed another candidate as a potential high-energy neutrino counterpart: AT2019aalc, which is also accompanied by a dust echo. However, follow-up stacking analysis of the 63 nuclear flares using the full IceCube data sample did not show any significant excess over background. Motivated by these three suggested neutrino-TDE correlations, we analyze a more extensive catalog of IR flares, 823 dust-echo-like flares identified using WISE satellite data, against the IceCube 10-year sample of track events from the Northern Sky. Our analysis aims to perform sensitivity studies and assess the potential detectability of neutrino emission from these types of accretion flares. In addition, we carry out a correlation study of the 823 dust echo-like flares against a revised catalog of IceCube high-purity astrophysical alerts, and reevaluate the previous study of 63 nuclear flares against the same revised alerts sample.

 - **Abstract**
 The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V (SDSS-V) is pioneering panoptic spectroscopy: it is the first all-sky, multi-epoch, optical-to-infrared spectroscopic survey. SDSS-V is mapping the sky with multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) at telescopes in both hemispheres (the 2.5-m Sloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory and the 100-inch du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory), where 500 zonal robotic fiber positioners feed light from a wide-field focal plane to an optical (R$\sim 2000$, 500 fibers) and a near-infrared (R$\sim 22,000$, 300 fibers) spectrograph. In addition to these MOS capabilities, the survey is pioneering ultra wide-field ($\sim$ 4000~deg$^2$) integral field spectroscopy enabled by a new dedicated facility (LVM-I) at Las Campanas Observatory, where an integral field spectrograph (IFS) with 1801 lenslet-coupled fibers arranged in a 0.5 degree diameter hexagon feeds multiple R$\sim$4000 optical spectrographs that cover 3600-9800 angstroms. SDSS-V's hardware and multi-year survey strategy are designed to decode the chemo-dynamical history of the Milky Way Galaxy and tackle fundamental open issues in stellar physics in its Milky Way Mapper program, trace the growth physics of supermassive black holes in its Black Hole Mapper program, and understand the self-regulation mechanisms and the chemical enrichment of galactic ecosystems at the energy-injection scale in its Local Volume Mapper program. The survey is well-timed to multiply the scientific output from major all-sky space missions. The SDSS-V MOS programs began robotic operations in 2021; IFS observations began in 2023 with the completion of the LVM-I facility. SDSS-V builds upon decades of heritage of SDSS's pioneering advances in data analysis, collaboration spirit, infrastructure, and product deliverables in astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 Mapping the local and distant Universe is key to our understanding of it. For decades, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has made a concerted effort to map millions of celestial objects to constrain the physical processes that govern our Universe. The most recent and fifth generation of SDSS (SDSS-V) is organized into three scientific ``mappers". Milky Way Mapper (MWM) that aims to chart the various components of the Milky Way and constrain its formation and assembly, Black Hole Mapper (BHM), which focuses on understanding supermassive black holes in distant galaxies across the Universe, and Local Volume Mapper (LVM), which uses integral field spectroscopy to map the ionized interstellar medium in the local group. This paper describes and outlines the scope and content for the nineteenth data release (DR19) of SDSS and the most substantial to date in SDSS-V. DR19 is the first to contain data from all three mappers. Additionally, we also describe nine value added catalogs (VACs) that enhance the science that can be conducted with the SDSS-V data. Finally, we discuss how to access SDSS DR19 and provide illustrative examples and tutorials.
#### Kilohertz Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Star Mergers: Full Spectrum Analyses and High-density Constraints on Neutron Star Matter

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate Bayesian analyses of the complete gravitational-wave spectrum of binary neutron star mergers events with the next-generation detector Einstein Telescope. Our mock analyses are performed for 20 different signals using the TEOBResumSPA_NRPMw waveform that models gravitational-waves from the inspiral to the postmerger phase. They are employed to validate a pipeline for neutron star's extreme matter constraints with prospective detections and under minimal hypotheses on the equation of state. The proposed analysis stack delivers inferences for the mass-radius curve, the mass dependence of the quadrupolar tidal polarizability parameter, the neutron star's maximum density, the maximum mass and the relative radius, and the pressure-density relation itself. We show that a single event at a signal-to-noise ratio close to the minimum threshold for postmerger detection is sufficient to tightly constrain all the above relations as well as quantities like the maximum mass (maximum density) to precision of ${\sim}6$% (${\sim}10$%) at 90% credibility level. We also revisit inferences of prompt black hole formation with full spectrum signals and find that the latter can be robustly identified, even when the postmerger is not detectable due to a low signal-to-noise ratio. New results on the impact of the initial signal frequency and of the detector configuration (triangular vs. two-L) on the source's parameters estimation are also reported. An improvement of approximately one order of magnitude in the precision of the chirp mass and mass ratio can be achieved by lowering the initial frequency from 20 Hz to 2 Hz. The two-L configuration shows instead significant improvements on the inference of the source declination, due to geographical separation of the two detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 LISA data analysis represents one of the most challenging tasks ahead for the future of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. Characterizing the instrument's noise properties while fitting for all the other detectable sources is a key requirement of any robust inference pipeline. Noise estimation will also play a crucial role in searches and parameter estimation of cosmological and astrophysical stochastic signals. Previous studies have tackled this topic by assuming perfect knowledge of the spectral shape of the instrumental noise and of different possible types of GW Stochastic Backgrounds (SGWBs), usually resorting to parametrized templates. Recently, various works that employ template-agnostic methods have been presented. In this work, we take an additional step further, introducing flexible spectral shapes in both the instrumental noise and the stochastic signals. We account for the lack of knowledge of the exact shape of the individual contributions to the overall power spectral density by using splines to represent arbitrary perturbations of the noise and signal spectral densities. We implement a data-driven Reversible Jump MCMC algorithm to fit different components simultaneously and to infer the level of flexibility required under different scenarios. We test this approach on simulated LISA data produced under different assumptions. We investigate the impact of this increased flexibility on the reconstruction of both the injected signal and the noise level, and we discuss the prospects for claiming a successful SGWB detection.

 This paper proposes a research program into how the special properties of the cubic chiral higher spin gravity theory may play a role in conformal cyclic cosmology and black hole physics, in particular for the black hole information paradox. The paper is qualitative, raising a number of questions and connections, that may be interesting to pursue in more detail. The proposal is based on a new -- at least not so commonly expressed -- view on the presumptive role of higher spin gauge fields in fundamental physics. In short, it is proposed that the non-unitary time evolution of the cubic chiral higher spin gravity theory is precisely what is needed for bridging the very large entropy gap between aeons in Roger Penrose's cosmological theory CCC.

 - **Abstract**
 Recently it has been shown that the third law of black hole mechanics can be violated: an exactly extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole can form in finite time in gravitational collapse of matter with a large charge to mass ratio. However, it has also been proved that this cannot happen if the matter satisfies a ``supersymmetric'' lower bound on its energy in terms of its charge. This paper proves an analogous result for black holes with a negative cosmological constant. The result states that a supersymmetric Kerr-Newman-anti de Sitter black hole cannot form in gravitational collapse of charged matter satisfying the supersymmetric bound. The results for zero or negative cosmological constant are extended to apply to two-sided black holes: it is proved that an initially non-extremal black hole cannot evolve to a supersymmetric black hole in finite time, irrespective of whether or not the initial black hole was formed in gravitational collapse.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which a solar mass compact object is whirling around a supermassive black hole, act as precise tracers of the spacetime geometry and astrophysical environment around the supermassive black hole. These systems are highly sensitive to even the smallest deviations from the vacuum general relativity scenario. However, detecting these signals requires highly accurate waveform modeling up to the first post-adiabatic order, incorporating self-force effects, system parameters, and environmental influences. In this paper, we focus on the impact of dark matter on gravitational waveforms. Cold dark matter in galactic centers can be redistributed by the gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole, forming a dense, spike-like profile. When an EMRI evolves in such an environment, the interaction between the binary and the surrounding dark matter can leave distinctive imprints on the emitted waveform, and thus offer a novel way to probe the nature and distribution of dark matter. We specifically examine how dark matter modifies the background spacetime. By treating these modifications perturbatively, we present a framework to incorporate dark matter environmental effects into gravitational waveform modeling at the first post-adiabatic order.

 - **Abstract**
 Early warning of gravitational waves (GWs) is essential for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star merger events. In this study, we investigate early warning prospects from eccentric compact binaries, whose mergers are expected to comprise a significant fraction of detected GW events in the future. Eccentric binaries exhibit oscillatory frequency evolution, causing GW frequencies to recur multiple times through their coalescence. Consequently, generating eccentric waveform templates for early warning requires specification of initial conditions. While the standard approach involves initiating waveform generation when the orbit-averaged frequency enters the detector band, we compare this with an alternative approach that uses the periastron frequency as the starting point. Our analysis shows that initializing at the periastron frequency yields an improved signal-to-noise ratio and sky localization. Additionally, including subdominant modes alongside the dominant $(2,2)$ mode leads to further improvements in sky localization. We explore the parameter space of primary mass $m_1 \in [1.4, 15] \, M_\odot$, spin $\chi_1 \in [0, 0.8]$, and eccentricity $e \leq 0.4$ across three detector configurations: O5, Voyager, and 3G. We find that in the O5 (Voyager) configuration, including eccentricity and subdominant modes, the sky localization area can be reduced by $2-80\% (2-85\%)$ at 1000 sq. deg. with increasing eccentricity from $e_5 = 0.1$ to $e_5 = 0.4$, yielding up to $41$ seconds (1 minute) of extra early warning time. For NSBH systems, subdominant modes contribute up to $70$ $(94)\%$ reduction for O5 (Voyager) scenario. In the 3G detector scenario, the sky area reduction due to eccentricity reaches $80\%$ (from $e_{2.5} = 0.1$ to $e_{2.5} = 0.4$) at 100 sq. deg., and subdominant modes enhance the reduction up to $98\%$ for NSBH systems.
