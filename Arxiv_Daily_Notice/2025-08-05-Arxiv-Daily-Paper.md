#### GW231123 Formation from Population III Stars: Isolated Binary Evolution

 - **Abstract**
 GW231123 is a merger of two black holes (BHs) whose inferred masses exceed $100\;{\rm M}_\odot$ typically; they are the most massive BHs among those discovered by gravitational wave (GW) observations. We examine if GW231123-like events can be formed from isolated Population (Pop) III binary stars by means of binary population synthesis calculations. We find that Pop III isolated binary stars can create GW231123-like events at a rate large enough to explain the discovery of GW231123, if two conditions are satisfied. First, Pop III stars evolve with inefficient convective overshooting, and second the $^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}{\rm O}$ rate is $2\sigma$ lower than the standard value. On the other hand, GW190521, which is the most massive BHs in Gravitational Wave Transient Catalog 3, can be formed from isolated Pop III binary stars even if the $^{12}{\rm C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}{\rm O}$ rate is the standard value. We reveal that the discovery of GW231123 is progressively putting constraints on possible parameter ranges of single star evolution models, assuming that all the GW events are formed through isolated binary evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Propagating fluctuations within accretion disks are known to induce multi-wavelength variability across diverse timescales. While these fluctuations have been widely invoked to explain rapid timing phenomena within the inner disk region in the frequency domain, observational signatures of outer-disk fluctuations propagating in the time domain remain sparse. Here, we present an analysis of observations by the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) during the 2023 outburst of the newly discovered low-mass black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8-1613. Follow-up, high-cadence monitoring reveals intense variability in disk emission, attributable to fluctuations in the accretion rate. These disk fluctuations exhibit damped amplitudes and shortened flare periods. We interpret these features as observational evidence of fluctuations originating at and propagating from large radii, supported by fitting the disk light curves with a propagating fluctuation model. Furthermore, we propose that a plausible mechanism driving these fluctuations is the cyclical propagation of heating and cooling fronts in the context of the disk instability model. This work bridges theoretical predictions with time-domain observations, offering critical insights into the dynamic processes governing accretion disks.

#### Cosmological Constraints on $f(T,B)$ Gravity from Observations of Early and Late Universe

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01652

 - **Abstract**
 This study proposes a unified framework comprising two complementary approaches to constrain three functional forms of $f(T,B)$ gravity, namely the linear, quadratic, and general power law models, by jointly utilizing early and late Universe observations. First, we impose bounds on deviations in the weak interaction freeze-out temperature, informed by the latest measurements of the primordial helium-4 mass fraction. Second, we incorporate direct Hubble parameter data, $H(\mathcal{z})$, obtained from Cosmic Chronometers in the redshift range $0.07\le\mathcal{z}\le2.0$, to trace the expansion history of the Universe. By minimizing a combined chi-square statistic across both datasets, we derive the best-fit values and confidence intervals for each model parameter. The joint analysis significantly refines the parameter constraints compared to methods based solely on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, thereby offering a more robust test of $f(T,B)$ gravity across cosmic epochs. The results support the viability of torsion-based modifications to General Relativity and provide a consistent methodology for future evaluation using upcoming observational data.

#### Resolving the Planck-DESI tension by non-minimally coupled quintessence

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01759

 - **Abstract**
 The Planck measurement of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) has established the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model as the concordant model along with other observations. However, recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration have renewed the matter fraction $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension between DESI-$\Lambda$CDM and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. Directly reconciling this CMB-BAO tension with a dynamical DE in Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization seems to imply a crossing of the equation-of-state through $w=-1$ at low redshifts. In this letter, we will illustrate with a string-theory-motivated model that, when the DM non-minimally couples to gravity via a quintessence field, a misidentification with the $w_0w_a$CDM model would exactly fake such a crossing behavior, while the coupled quintessence never crosses $w=-1$ but behaves as a standard CDM in the early Universe and approaches a cosmological constant in the late Universe. Such a non-minimal coupling is preferred over $3\sigma$ confidence level. The worsened $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension and $S_8$ tension in the $w_0w_a$CDM model are also resolved in our model.

#### Clustering of Primordial Black Holes in Excursion Set Theory

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01896

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the clustering of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) within the framework of Excursion Set Theory (EST). The EST formalism is extended to compute the joint probability of forming PBH pairs within a clustering distance, based on two stochastic trajectories with a shared history. Our results show that an enhanced power spectrum not only increases the formation of PBHs in specific mass ranges but also enhances their clustering probability. We find a one-to-one correspondence between the blue-tilted spectral index and the mass ranges in which PBHs form and cluster. Additionally, we demonstrate that the clustering probability decreases asymptotically with increasing clustering distance, while a higher critical density threshold (barrier) leads to a suppression of clustering abundance.

#### On the origin of a possible hard VHE spectrum from M87 discovered by LHAASO

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01986

 - **Abstract**
 Recent LHAASO observations hint at potential spectral hardening around 20 TeV in M87's very high energy (VHE) emission, suggesting a possible new radiation component. In this work, we construct averaged multiwavelength SEDs by combining data from Chandra and Swift-UVOT/XRT covering the same period as the LHAASO detection to investigate the origin of this feature. We test several radiation mechanisms, including the pp interaction, proton synchrotron emission, photomeson process and two-zone leptonic model. We find that only the pion decay gamma rays in pp interactions can interpret this feature in the framework of the one-zone model. With analytical analysis, we prove that proton synchrotron emission cannot generate a hard spectrum above 0.17~TeV. For photomeson model, it requires an emission zone compressed near the Schwarzschild radius of the central supermassive black hole, incompatible with broadband optical-GeV spectral constraints. In addition, the two-zone leptonic model also emerges as a viable alternative.

#### $νp$-process in Core-Collapse Supernovae: Imprints of General Relativistic Effects

 - **Abstract**
 The origin of certain proton-rich isotopes in the solar system, particularly $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$, has been a long-standing puzzle. A promising explanation is the $\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in the neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after shock revival. Recent studies have identified several relevant physical effects that influence the yields of this process. The impact of General Relativity (GR) on the $\nu p$-process yields, however, remains unexplored. In this work, we perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated yields of the $p$ nuclei up to $A \lesssim 105$ in Newtonian and fully GR neutrino-driven outflows, using a detailed model of a time-evolving outflow profile. The two main GR effects are the gravitational shift of neutrino energies and post-Newtonian corrections to the gravitational potential. These effects together suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the $\nu p$-process yields in our 18 $M_\odot$ progenitor model. Most of the production of the crucial $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$ $p$ isotopes in this model occurs in an optimal time window, 1-3 seconds after shock revival. Interestingly, the same does not apply to the shielded isotope $^{92}{\rm Nb}$, a large fraction of which is produced in the subsequent ejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final abundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In our 12.75 $M_\odot$ model, an additional GR effect is observed: the outflow transitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion, causing the yields to drop. This study quantifies the important role GR effects play in the $\nu p$-process and provides guidance for identifying optimal conditions in future self-consistent supernova simulations.

#### Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime in regular coordinates with cosmological time

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00951

 - **Abstract**
 Starting from the Einstein equations in Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime and imposing Friedmann-Robertson-Walker coordinates at large distances, we find two coordinate systems with time-dependent metrics that are smooth across both the black hole and cosmological horizons. These coordinates require a positive cosmological constant for regularity, and thus they are not de Sitter extensions of the Kruskal-Szekeres or Israel coordinates. One of the coordinate systems was only found in 1999 (Abbassi coordinates), and it has led to conflicting interpretations in the literature, while the other was briefly commented on and promptly dismissed as unphysical or incompatible with SdS. We derive that the second solution is equivalent to the first one, and that both are indeed equivalent descriptions of SdS spacetime. We also derive explicit coordinate transformations linking these coordinate systems to the Kottler coordinates and the maximally extended Lake-Israel coordinates. Among other applications, these results, which extend the largely used cosmological and local coordinates, should be useful for further developments in understanding the exact interplay between black holes and the cosmological background, which has been the focus of a number of recent works.

 - **Abstract**
 Kerr Sen black holes possess stretchon parameters and hidden conformal symmetries. The superradiant stability and steady state resonance of such black holes warrant further investigation and form the primary motivation for this study. In this work,we introduce an additional variable, referred to as y, to generalize the findings of the previous study. When the frequency of the perturbation lies within a specific range namely, above a certain threshold determined by the spin parameter and below the sum of the azimuthal quantum number times the angular velocity at the horizon and the product of the charge with the electric potential at the horizon,the Kerr Sen black hole exhibits superradiant stability. This behavior is similar to the superradiant characteristics previously observed in KN black holes.

#### Quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder models in loop quantum cosmology with Lorentz term

 - **Abstract**
 A novel quantum black hole model is derived by incorporating the Lorentzian term within the loop quantum cosmology framework of the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder (qOS) model. This model features a quantum-corrected metric tensor, representing a deformation of the classical Schwarzschild solution. Investigations into the quasi-normal modes reveal that these quantum-corrected black holes exhibit stability against scalar perturbations. Notably, the exponential decay rate within the Lorentzian qOS model demonstrates a significant reduction compared to both the earlier qOS model devoid of this term and the standard Schwarzschild black hole. The higher overtones of the Lorentzian qOS model also differ significantly from those of the earlier qOS model and the standard Schwarzschild black hole, indicating that the near-horizon geometry is substantially modified. The thermodynamic properties with both positive and negative cosmological constant are considered. For the anti-de Sitter case, our analysis reveals that for small black hole masses, the temperature within this loop quantum gravity framework decreases as the mass diminishes, contrasting with classical black hole behavior. Furthermore, a logarithmic term emerges as the leading-order correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Additionally, LQG corrections induce an extra phase transition in the black hole's heat capacity at smaller radius. While for the de Sitter case, the temperature increases as the mass decreases for small black holes, again differing from classical expectations. Similarly to the anti-de Sitter case, LQG corrections in the de Sitter case also lead to an extra phase transition in the heat capacity at small radius.

 - **Abstract**
 The new dynamical solutions of Einstein's equations with perfect fluid in space-times with FLRW asymptotic behaviour, derived recently \cite{Cot,Cot1,Cot2}, may describe evaporating black holes whose masses dissipate into dust. The time evolution of the black hole and dust masses of simple models of evaporating black holes are studied using analytical and graphical methods.

#### A General Model for Dark Energy Crossing the Phantom Divide

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01378

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01378

 - **Abstract**
 Within the framework of spatially covariant theories, we propose a general model for dark energy (DE) in which the cosmological background and perturbations are independently controlled by different sets of coefficients, and the equation of state of DE is directly determined by two free functions of time from the Lagrangian. These properties allow to realize arbitrary background evolutions while avoiding ghost and gradient instabilities in linear perturbations. They also enable a more direct analysis of phantom crossing without having to first solve the background equations of motion. In this model, the sound speed of the scalar mode is scale-dependent and approaches infinity at large scale, so that the field becomes non-dynamical in the infrared (IR) limit. Even though this usually indicates a strong coupling issue, we speculate that this is avoided because the scalar degree of freedom becomes frozen not only at linear order but also at any higher order in IR limit. Given this characteristic large scales behavior, we dub the model \emph{Freezing Gravity}. On smaller scales, the scalar mode propagates with a finite speed of sound. The theory has a cut-off in energy, signaled by the pole in the speed of sound, when the effective Planck mass exceeds Planck mass.

#### Gravitational Waves from Simulated Mergers of 2 and 3 Black Holes

 - **Abstract**
 In this project, we simulate the collision of two and three black holes using NRPy+ (`Python-based code generation for numerical relativity and beyond') module and BSSN (Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura) formulation, and extract the resulting gravitational waveforms. Using Brill-Lindquist initial data and sixth-order finite differences, we evolve the system using the BSSN formulation and compute the gravitational-wave signal via the Weyl scalar $\psi_4$. To assess numerical error, we plot the Hamiltonian constraint and observe that constraint violations are significantly higher in the three-black-hole collision. Unexpected gravitational recoil is also detected, which may influence waveform extraction and that is left for further investigation. Despite the limitations in computational resources imposed by the Google Colab, we successfully model the merger of a binary black hole system, and we were able to extract the corresponding gravitational waves.

#### Statistical Entropy Based on the Generalized-Uncertainty-Principle-Induced Effective Metric

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01559

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the statistical entropy of black holes within the framework of the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) by employing effective metrics that incorporate leading-order and all-orders quantum gravitational corrections. We construct three distinct effective metrics induced by the GUP, which are derived from GUP-corrected temperature, entropy, and all-orders GUP corrections, and analyze their impact on black hole entropy using 't Hooft's brick wall method. Our results show that, despite the differences in the effective metrics and the corresponding ultraviolet cutoffs, the statistical entropy consistently satisfies the Bekenstein-Hawking area law when expressed in terms of an invariant (coordinate-independent) distance near the horizon. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the GUP naturally regularizes the ultraviolet divergence in the density of states, eliminating the need for artificial cutoffs and yielding finite entropy even when counting quantum states only in the vicinity of the event horizon. These findings highlight the universality and robustness of the area law under GUP modifications and provide new insights into the interplay between quantum gravity effects and black hole thermodynamics.

#### Wave Function Collapse Triggering Spacetime Dynamics in Semiclassical Gravity

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01573

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01573

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a novel semiclassical mechanism to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity, where wave function collapse in a superposition state induces a rapid change in the energy-momentum tensor, triggering spacetime dynamics that propagate at the speed of light. Unlike models assuming superposed spacetimes, we posit that the superposition yields a single, continuous classical spacetime driven by the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor. Upon collapse, the abrupt shift modifies the spacetime metric via Einstein's field equations, respecting causality. We explore this for a particle in a spatial superposition, propose detailed experimental designs with numerical simulations of gravitational perturbations, address potential theoretical challenges, and discuss implications for existing quantum-gravity theories. This framework offers a pathway to reconcile quantum and gravitational dynamics without quantizing spacetime, with testable signatures in future experiments.

#### Revisiting the Penrose Process in Rotating Black Holes with Quantum Corrections: Implications for Energy Extraction and Irreducible Mass

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01683

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01683

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the extraction of energy from a rotating black hole spacetime modified by a quantum correction parameter \( \alpha \). Focusing on particle splitting within the ergoregion, we analyze the Penrose process and compute the extraction efficiency \( \eta \) as a function of both the spin parameter \( a \) and the quantum correction parameter \( \alpha \). Our results show that increasing \( \alpha \) induces an inward shift of the event horizon and the static limit, resulting in a modest expansion of the ergoregion. This geometric change significantly enhances the energy extraction potential. By numerically solving the horizon equation, we determine a maximum extraction efficiency of 11.64\%. Additionally, we derive the expression for the irreducible mass, highlighting its fundamental role in constraining the amount of extractable rotational energy. Overall, our findings demonstrate that quantum corrections have a substantial impact on black hole energetics, leading to marked deviations from predictions based on classical Kerr theory.

#### Charged Taub-NUT type Black Holes in Einstein-Weyl-Maxwell Theory

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01790

 - **Abstract**
 We numerically construct new charged Taub-NUT-type black hole solutions in four-dimensional Einstein-Weyl-Maxwell theory. We explore the effects of the NUT parameter and the electric charge parameter on the black hole solutions in great detail. Compared with static spherical black holes in the same theory, there is one major difference: there are three branches of NUT solutions, whereas there are only two branches of static spherical black hole solutions. Compared with neutral NUT solutions in Weyl gravity, where the solutions intersect with each other, the charged NUT solutions we find are disconnected.

#### The space-time structure of an untouchable naked singularity

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01820

 - **Abstract**
 According to the Cosmic Censorship conjecture, naked singularities are thought to be forbidden in nature and must remain hidden by a horizon. In this work, we present the causal structure of an exact solution to the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton equations representing a wormhole (WH), where the ring singularity, without even horizon, is untouchable, this is, causally disconnected from the rest of the universe. We analyze its metric functions in Papapetrou coordinates to verify metric analyticity in spacetime, construct the Carter-Penrose diagram, and use Boyer-Linquist coordinates to visualize the lining of the ring singularity by the throat. We conclude that the ring singularity in this WH is lined by the throat, similar to how the event horizon lines the ring singularity in the Kerr-Newman black hole, satisfying the Wormhole Cosmic Censorship Conjecture. In this work we show that the topology of the WH is such that the two sides of the throat are separated by the singularity, but are topologically identified, giving rise to an instantaneous connection between these two regions.

#### Generalized Vaidya Spacetime in Cotton and Conformal Killing Theories

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01827

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01827

 - **Abstract**
 We demonstrate that the non-vacuum field equations of Cotton gravity and Conformal Killing gravity admit a generalized class of Vaidya-type solutions. In particular, beyond the standard induced term associated with the matter source, the generalized metric incorporates two additional correction terms of purely geometric origin, arising from the unique structure of these theories. This extended solution generalizes the classical Vaidya spacetime in General Relativity and offers new insights into the dynamics of radiating spacetimes within the framework of these third-rank gravity theories.

 - **Abstract**
 The introduction of thermodynamics into gravitational physics began 5 decades ago with the discovery that black holes behave like thermodynamic systems once semiclassical quantum effects are taken into account. Notions of temperature, entropy, work, and phase changes that were introduced into gravitational physics and originally applied to black holes, were later extended to cosmological horizons and other settings as well. A major development occurred 15 years ago with the introduction of pressure in the form of a cosmological constant. By extending the thermodynamic phase space to include this term, along with its conjugate volume, black holes were found to exhibit a broad variety of phase transitions that resembled phenomena seen in chemistry labs. Black hole thermodynamics has become Black Hole Chemistry, which has led to a wealth of insights into the nature of black holes, introducing concepts such as Van der Waals fluids, reentrant phase transitions, and triple points into gravitational physics. I discuss the origins of Black Hole Chemistry and its basic features covered in an earlier review [1], and then go on to describe developments in the subject that have taken place since then. Examples include multicritical behaviour, polymeric transitions, superfluid transitions, scalar hair, heat engines, NUT-charge, acceleration thermodynamics, the Joule-Thompson expansion, holography, complexity, central charge criticality, microstructure, thermodynamic tension, phase dynamics, and thermodynamic topology. This wealth of new phenomena suggest that we likely still have a lot to learn from Black Hole Chemistry.

#### Averaging Dynamics of Scalar Field-Matter Interacting Models in Anisotropic Universes: The Locally Rotationally Symmetric Bianchi I Spacetime

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01876

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01876

 - **Abstract**
 We consider an anisotropic cosmological model based on the locally rotational Bianchi I spacetime, incorporating a scalar field and a non-zero cosmological interaction term. The framework of averaging theory is employed to study the associated non-linear differential equations. Through a qualitative analysis of the gravitational field equations, we obtain valuable insights into the structure of the solution space for the anisotropic scalar field model with a generalized harmonic potential. The interaction between the scalar field and matter is described by a general expression that depends on the Hubble parameter, the time derivative of the scalar field, and the energy densities of cold dark matter and dark energy. This formulation involves real parameters that modulate the interaction, as well as a coupling constant with the dimensions of the Hubble parameter. We show that the Hubble parameter serves as a time-dependent perturbation parameter, controlling the discrepancy between the full system and its time-averaged counterpart. As this parameter decreases, both systems converge to the same asymptotic behaviour. This enables the suppression of oscillatory effects, significantly simplifying the dynamical analysis. Finally, we identify conditions on the interaction parameters that ensure the regularity of the system's evolution by preventing the emergence of singularities.

#### Formation of Frozen Stars from collapsing matter by tunneling

 - **Abstract**
 The frozen star is a type of black hole mimicker: An ultracompact object whose exterior geometry resembles that of a general-relativistic black hole but differs in its matter composition and in the regularity of its interior geometry. It is sourced by a spherically symmetric collection of open-string flux tubes, which posses an extremely anisotropic energy-momentum-stress tensor with maximally negative radial pressure. The frozen star represents an effective classical description of the highly quantum, closed-string polymer model. A key challenge for any model of a black hole mimicker is to explain how such objects can form from a collapsing body of matter. We started to address this important problem in a previous article by adapting the Euclidean-action method of Gibbons and Hawking to show that the transition into a frozen star is likely. Here, we improve on our previous results by showing that the transition probability for a collapsing shell of matter to tunnel quantum mechanically into a frozen star is unity, up to negligible corrections. Our conclusion is that such a transition is therefore inevitable.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work we have proposed some spherically symmetric, static spacetimes in a theory of gravity which permits non-minimal coupling (NMC) between curvature of spacetime and fluid variables. It is shown that these non-minimally coupled theories may admit of new class of metric solutions. Known metric solutions from GR can also be solutions of the non-minimally coupled theories, for these cases the NMC affects the nature of the fluid which sources the spacetime. The paper presents multiple ways in which the modified field equations appearing in non-minimally coupled theories can be solved. The NMC produces multiple definitions of the stress-energy tensor. The paper discusses the complexity related to these sources of curvature as, unlike in minimally coupled general relativity, in the present theory the Ricci curvature itself can affect the stress-energy tensor of the effective fluid which seeds spacetime curvature. The various energy conditions related to various forms of possible stress-energy tensors are presented in the paper.

We argue the correct analogue of coordinate independence is the invariance under changes of graph labels, a kind of permutation invariance. Invariants are formed by a group average that probes the entire graph -- they are global. Strikingly, sets of complete observables can be constructed so that each seeks a connected subgraph structure -- local correlations. Geometrical information is fully encoded in background independent observables through this subtle interplay of global and local graph notions, a behavior we term glocal. This provides physically meaningful complete sets of observables for discrete general relativity, suggests a reformulation of the spin networks state space of loop quantum gravity, and reveals deep connections between the problem of observables and the graph isomorphism problem.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the interferometric signatures of hairy Schwarzschild black holes (hSBHs) that have either single or double photon spheres. Our interest mainly stems from two considerations: (i) the photon ring structure in black hole images produces strong and universal interferometric signatures on long baselines, enabling precision measurements of black hole parameters and testing gravitational theory; (ii) the hSBH describes the deformation of standard Schwarzschild black hole (SBH) induced by additional sources, and they can feature double photon spheres within certain parameter regimes. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that for a hSBH with a single photon sphere, the complex visibility amplitude of the image exhibits damped oscillations. A similar behavior appears in the double photon sphere case when the inner photon sphere has lower effective potential than the outer one, as the photons near the inner photon sphere remain trapped by gravity. However, when the inner potential is higher, a beat pattern rises. Our findings reveal that the complex visibility amplitude can encode the signature of the photon sphere structure of the central black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the evolution of a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe in the framework of scalar non-metricity theory of gravity. In the model, we consider dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) described by the scalar field. In the paper, we examine the asymptotic behavior of the evolution of the observed universe. We probe the universe with and without an interaction between DM and the effective energy density including scalar field in the non-metricity theory that describes the DE. The critical points of the autonomous system and their stability are determined to understand the behaviour of the universe. The cosmological models accommodate the late accelerating phase of the universe for a given set of parameters, a matter-dominated saddle point is also found to exist which is flowed by a decelerating phase dominated by stiff fluid like DE. We obtain a new class of cosmological model accommodating early inflation, matter-dominated era, and a future decelerating phase followed by late acceleration of the universe.

 - **Abstract**
 A class of gravity theories respecting spatial covariance and in the presence of non-dynamical auxiliary scalar fields with only spatial derivatives is investigated. Generally, without higher temporal derivatives in the metric sector, there are 3 degrees of freedom (DOFs) propagating due to the breaking of general covariance. Through a Hamiltonian constraint analysis, we examine the conditions to eliminate the scalar DOF such that only 2 DOFs, which correspond the tensorial gravitational waves in a homogeneous and isotropic background, are propagating. We find that two conditions are needed, each of which can eliminate half degree of freedom. The second condition can be further classified into two cases according to its effect on the Dirac matrix. We also apply the formal conditions to a polynomial-type Lagrangian as a concrete example, in which all the monomials are spatially covariant scalars containing two derivatives. Our results are consistent with the previous analysis based on the perturbative method.

 - **Abstract**
 In the frame of conformal Killing gravity cosmology, we performed a Bayesian analysis on two different datasets of Baryonic Acoustic oscillations (DESI and SDSS DR16) and on two datasets of SNeIa (Pantheon+ and Union3). The results for H0 and Omega_M in a spatially flat FRW background are consistent with the Lambda-CDM scenario. We obtain a non-negligible negative value for the novel density of dark sector, Omega_D, and its relevance in the evolution of the cosmological observables thus finding quantitatively what its contribution is on real data to match the standard scenario. The results confirm the dynamical character of dark energy. We also calculate the deceleration parameter q0 and the present time dark energy equation of state parameter w0: the latter belongs to the quintessence regime. The evaluation of the first acoustic peak of CMB places it extraordinarily near to the best value provided by the Planck collaboration. In this scenario, we can conclude that late time and early time data can be successfully matched under the same standard.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter spacetimes exhibiting radiative behavior, employing null gauges that allow for a well-defined flat limit. The radiative content in the bulk is captured by the super-Poynting vector, which we reinterpret holographically in terms of fluid variables in the dual boundary theory. For algebraically special solutions, we uncover a close connection between bulk radiation and dissipative corrections in the boundary stress tensor, demonstrating a direct link between radiation and entropy production in the boundary fluid. This reveals a rich interplay between radiative dynamics in the bulk and out-of-equilibrium conformal physics at the boundary. We then investigate the flat limit of this correspondence in the context of flat-space holography. In this setting, we construct a Carrollian analogue of the super-Poynting vector and introduce Celestial observables, such as energy detectors, which emerge naturally from the bulk's radiative structure. Our analysis shows that bulk radiation sources the Carrollian viscous stress tensor and heat current, which encodes the Bondi news in this framework. We illustrate our results with explicit examples, including Robinson-Trautman spacetimes and accelerating black holes.

#### Cosmic-Quantum Connections: Assessing the Viability of Weak Gravity and Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjectures in Kerr-Newman-Kiselev-Letelier Black Hole

 - **Abstract**
 This paper addresses a potential validation of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) with the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC), as a significant challenge in quantum gravity. We explore the viability of the WGC and WCCC in the context of the Kerr-Newman-Kiselev-Letelier (KNKL) black hole. Although these conjectures appear unrelated, but surprising connection between these conjectures, It establishes a bridge between the quantum and the cosmic. By imposing specific constraints on the black hole's parameters, we demonstrate that the WGC and WCCC can be compatible in certain regions. We examine the properties of the KNKL black hole for $q/m > (Q/M )_{ext}$, where $(Q/M )_{ext}$ is the charge-to-mass ratio of a large extremal black hole. We present figures to test the validity of both conjectures simultaneously. Without the spin parameter \(a\), the cloud of string parameter \(b\), quintessence parameter \(\gamma\), and equation of state parameter \(\omega\), the black hole either has two event horizons if \(Q^2/M^2 \leq 1\) or none event horizon if \(Q^2/M^2 > 1\) which leads to a naked singularity that contradicts the WCCC. However, when \(a\), \(b\), \(\gamma\), and \(\omega\) are present, the black hole has event horizons in some regions in the \(Q^2/M^2 > 1\) that ensure the singularity is covered and both the WGC and WCCC are fulfilled. Actually, we face this issue in the extremality state of the black hole viz these conjectures remain viable, with the black hole maintaining an event horizon. We conclude that certain regions of \(a\), \(b\), \(\gamma\), and \(\omega\) parameters can make the WGC and WCCC compatible, indicating their agreement when these parameters are present.

 - **Abstract**
 Thermodynamical topology has emerged as a powerful framework for classifying the thermodynamical behavior of black holes. Three distinct yet complementary topological invariants have been employed to characterize black hole phases, spinodal curves, and critical points in black hole thermodynamics. In this work, we develop a unified framework that integrates these three topological approaches and introduce the concept of extended thermodynamical topology, providing a clear physical interpretation. As a first step, we apply this framework to black holes in Einstein gravity, systematically elucidating their phase structure in terms of topological invariants. We then extend our analysis to black holes in 7-dimensional Lovelock gravity, where novel thermodynamic phenomena naturally emerge from the topological perspective. Moreover, we explore the connection between critical exponents and the extended thermodynamical topology, uncovering a correspondence between the zeros of the $k$-th order vector field and the associated critical exponents. Our study demonstrates that extended thermodynamical topology offers a robust and fine-grained framework for analyzing and classifying black hole phase transitions.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider a stationary solution of a charged black hole with scalar hair in AdS$_4$, where the scalar field is coupled to a $U(1)$ Maxwell gauge field. Near the singularity, the spacetime transitions into a more general Kasner geometry. The black hole is then injected with rotating and charged gravitational shock waves in the Dray-'t Hooft solution. These shock waves lengthen the wormhole connecting the two asymptotic boundaries, thereby disrupting the correlations between them. The correlation, quantified by the quantum mutual information between subregions on the left and right boundaries, vanishes at a characteristic timescale known as the scrambling time, which depends logarithmically on the black hole entropy. The mutual information is computed holographically using the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription for entanglement entropy. We investigate how the rotation and charge of both the black hole and the shock waves affect chaotic properties such as the scrambling time and the Lyapunov exponent. The interaction between the charges of the black hole and the shock waves introduces a delay in the scrambling process. We find that as the strength of the boundary deformation increases, both the Lyapunov exponent and the scrambling time delay decrease monotonically. Furthermore, the angular momentum of the shock waves enhances both the Lyapunov exponent and the scrambling time delay.

 - **Abstract**
 The formulation of gravity theories on noncommutative (NC) spacetimes has been an active area of research for some time. Various models and methods have been proposed in the literature. Even within the star-product formalism, there are several distinct approaches to constructing NC deformations of General Relativity (GR) and Einstein-Cartan-Palatini (ECP) gravity. Some models are based on the NC local Lorentz symmetry, while others rely on NC deformations of the diffeomorphism symmetry of GR. In this paper, we investigate the connection between two NC gravity models based on twisted and braided NC diffeomorphism symmetry. Although these two models yield different NC gravity actions, we show that, in certain cases, they lead to the same phenomenological consequences. In particular, they share identical three-graviton vertex and exhibit some simple common vacuum solutions. This work represents a step towards understanding the diverse landscape of NC gravity models constructed within the star-product framework.

 - **Abstract**
 Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) are special classes of quantum field theories that find applications ranging from critical phenomena to theories of quantum gravity via holography. Understanding thermal effects in CFTs is crucial: criticality is experimentally probed at finite temperature, and, from the holographic perspective, the study of thermal CFTs is dual to the study of black holes in Anti-de Sitter space. In this thesis, we explore the kinematics and dynamics of finite-temperature CFTs by analyzing broken and unbroken symmetries and adapting various analytical and numerical bootstrap approaches to finite-temperature correlation functions. These methods are non-perturbatively valid and can be tested against exactly solvable models, such as free theories and two-dimensional systems, as well as compared with perturbative calculations. The main applications discussed in this thesis concern one- and two-point functions and the free energy density in the O(N) models in three dimensions, with particular focus on the 3d Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models (N = 1,2,3).

 - **Abstract**
 We study three-dimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant under non-standard boundary conditions where chemical potentials are determined dynamically. Using a boundary Hamiltonian inspired by collective field theory (ColFT), the boundary dynamics reduce to those of a one-dimensional fluid on a circle, with configurations corresponding to bulk geometries such as BTZ black holes. Quantizing the system via bosonization of relativistic fermions, we obtain a microscopic description of black hole states in terms of Young diagrams, whose degeneracies match the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We compute the Euclidean canonical partition function and free energy for both the ColFT Hamiltonian and a relativistic free-fermion Hamiltonian. In the ColFT case, the partition function resembles that of chiral U(N) Yang-Mills theory on a torus, with N~1/(\beta G). This offers a novel way to compute quantum corrections to the partition function. The leading entropy term receives contributions from all genera, while the subleading logarithmic correction is one-loop exact, arising solely from the genus-one sector with coefficient -1/2 . This coefficient remains unchanged in the relativistic fermion case, suggesting the universality of the one-loop correction across different boundary Hamiltonians.
