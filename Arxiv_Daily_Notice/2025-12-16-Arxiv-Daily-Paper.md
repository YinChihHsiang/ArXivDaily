 - **Abstract**
 Inflationary models predicting abundant primordial black holes (PBHs) and large amplitude of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) often rely on amplified fluctuations over limited scales, typically driven by phase transitions, particle production, or departures from slow-roll evolution. While the power spectrum of these models has been extensively studied, higher-order correlations are much less understood. Motivated by the complex physics involved and the fact that PBH and SIGW formation are both sensitive to non-linearities, we present a detailed study of the bispectrum as the leading non-linear effect in these scenarios. We refer to the scale- and shape-dependence of the bispectrum collectively as its geometry; and define a scale-dependent shape correlator to disentangle the two dependencies. Generally, we find that for the scales most affected by phase transitions and particle production (including the power spectrum peak), the bispectrum is strongest near the equilateral configuration, while non-attractor phases tend to produce correlations near the squeezed configuration. We further propose a simplified bispectrum estimator, resembling local-type non-Gaussianity but with scale-dependent amplitude, that captures the main features of the full bispectrum. As an implication of our results, we show that incorporating the bispectrum significantly broadens the range of scales with a substantial probability of large smoothed density contrasts compared to linear analysis. This suggests that non-linearities can alter not only PBH abundance and SIGW amplitude but also their mass and frequency spectra. In particular, and in contrast with the usual assumption, our results hint that the second-highest peak of the power spectrum may produce more PBHs than the highest peak.

#### KiDS-Legacy: Constraints on Horndeski gravity from weak lensing combined with galaxy clustering and cosmic microwave background anisotropies

 - **Abstract**
 We present constraints on modified gravity from a cosmic shear analysis of the final data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-Legacy) in combination with DESI measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations, eBOSS observations of redshift space distortions, and cosmic microwave background anisotropies from Planck. We study the Horndeski class of modified gravity models in an effective field theory framework employing a parameterisation that satisfies stability conditions by construction and, for the first time, present a cosmological analysis in this inherently stable parameter basis. Cosmic shear constrains the Horndeski parameter space significantly, matching or surpassing the CMB contribution. Adopting the de-mixed kinetic term of the scalar field perturbation, $D_{\rm kin}$, and the deviation of the Planck mass from its fiducial value, $\Delta M_*^2\equiv M_*^2-1$, as model parameters, we constrain their present values to be $\Delta \hat{M}_*^2=0.32^{+0.07}_{-0.21}$ and $\hat{D}_{\rm kin} = 3.74^{+0.69}_{-1.92}$, which deviate from general relativity at $1.5\sigma$ and $1.9\sigma$, respectively. We derive constraints on the structure growth parameter $S_8=0.813^{+0.008}_{-0.011}$, which is compatible with the $\Lambda$CDM constraint at $0.54\sigma$. We obtain the deviation of the effective Newtonian coupling from the GR value as $\Delta \mu_{\infty,{\rm eff}}=0.066\pm0.023$, corresponding to a $2.9\sigma$ significance. Although modified gravity provides a slightly better fit to the data, a model comparison shows only a weak preference for modified gravity at the $1.4\sigma$ level. When adopting a dynamical dark energy model of the background cosmology, the inferred modified gravity parameter constraints are stable with respect to a $\Lambda$CDM background, while a mild preference at $1.57\sigma$ for dynamical dark energy remains.

#### KiDS-Legacy: Constraining dark energy, neutrino mass, and curvature

 - **Abstract**
 We constrain minimally extended cosmological models with the cosmic shear analysis of the final data release from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-Legacy) in combination with external probes. Due to the consistency of the KiDS-Legacy analysis with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we can combine these data sets reliably for the first time. Additionally, we use CMB lensing, galaxy redshift-space distortions, and baryon acoustic oscillations. We assess, in turn, the effects of spatial curvature, varying neutrino masses, and an evolving dark energy component on cosmological constraints from KiDS-Legacy alone and in combination with external probes. We find KiDS-Legacy to be consistent with the fiducial flat $\Lambda$CDM analysis with $c^2 \sum m_\nu\leq 1.5\,$eV, $w_0 = -1.0\pm 0.7$ and $w_a = -1.3^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$ while $\Omega_K = 0.08^{+0.16}_{-0.17}$ (1$\sigma$ bounds) with almost equal goodness-of-fit. $w_0w_a$CDM is not a significant improvement over $\Lambda$CDM when cosmic shear and CMB lensing are combined, yielding a Bayes factor $B = 0.07$. If all probes are combined, however, $B$ increases to 2.73, corresponding to a $2.6\sigma$ suspicousness tension. The constraint on $S_8 = \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3}$ is robust to opening up the parameter space for cosmic shear. Adding all external datasets to KiDS-Legacy, we find with $S_8 = 0.816 \pm 0.006$ in $\Lambda$CDM and $S_8 = 0.837 \pm 0.008$ in $w_0 w_a$CDM for all probes combined.

#### Dynamical constraints on the S2 (S0-2) star possible companions

 - **Abstract**
 The center of the Galaxy harbors a supermassive black hole, Sgr\,A*, which is surrounded by a massive star cluster known as the S-cluster. The most extensively studied star in this cluster is the B-type main-sequence S2 star (also known as S0-2). These types of stars are commonly found in binary systems in the Galactic field, but observations do not seem to detect a companion to S2. This absence may be attributed to observational biases or to a dynamically hostile environment caused by phenomena such as tidal disruption or mergers. Using a $N$-body code with first-order post-Newtonian corrections, we investigate whether S2 can host a stellar or planetary companion. We perform $10^{5}$ simulations adopting uniform distributions for the orbital elements of the companion. Our results show that companions may exist for orbital periods shorter than 100~days, eccentricities below 0.8, and across the full range of mutual inclinations. The number of surviving companions increases with shorter orbital periods, lower eccentricities, and nearly coplanar orbits. We also find that the disruption mechanisms include mergers driven by Lidov-Kozai cycles and breakups that occur when the companion surpasses the Hill radius of its orbit. Finally, we find that the presence of a companion would alter S2's astrometric signal by no more than $ 5\,\mu{\rm as}$. Current radial-velocity detection limits constrain viable stellar binary configurations to approximately 4.4\% of the simulated cases. Including astrometric limits reduces to 4.3\%. Imposing an additional constraint that any companion must have a mass $\lesssim 2\,M_{\odot}$ (otherwise it would be visible) narrows the fraction of undetectable stellar binaries to just 3.0\%.

#### Balmer Transition Signatures from Gas-Enshrouded, Dust-Poor Active Galactic Nuclei
 - **Authors:** Zu Yan, Kohei Inayoshi, Kejian Chen, Jingsong Guo

Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)

 - **Abstract**
 Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) recently discovered by JWST, show distinctive Balmer-transition features, including prominent Balmer absorption, pronounced Balmer breaks, and large equivalent widths of broad $\mathrm{H}\alpha$ emission, all of which indicate the presence of dense gas surrounding their central black holes. A further key property of LRDs is their large Balmer decrements with broad $\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\beta$ line-flux ratios far exceeding the Case B recombination value. These ratios of $\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\beta>3$ have often been interpreted as evidence for heavy dust extinction ($A_V\gtrsim 3$ mag), however such dust would inevitably produce strong near-to-mid infrared re-emission that is hardly seen in JWST/MIRI observations. To investigate the physical origin of these observed Balmer features, we perform radiation transfer calculations through dust-free, dense gas. We show that the observed large Balmer decrements ($\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\beta$ and $\mathrm{H}\alpha/\mathrm{H}\gamma$) naturally arise from Balmer resonance scattering without invoking dust. At sufficiently high densities ($n_\mathrm{H} \gtrsim 10^{{8}-{10}}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), the elevated multiple Balmer-line ratios converge to values that closely mimic dust reddening, explaining why LRD spectra resemble obscured AGNs. Furthermore, when the Balmer break and broad Balmer lines originate in the same dense gas, their strengths are physically linked, allowing us to constrain the density structure and infer a low broad-line region gas mass of $\sim O(10~M_\odot)$. Such a small gas reservoir would be enriched by even a single supernova, implying that LRDs with observed low-metallicity signatures likely experienced minimal star formation in their nuclei.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.11059

 - **Abstract**
 We present a novel self-consistent theoretical framework to characterize the formation, evolution, and merger sites of dynamically-formed black hole binaries, with a focus on explaining the most massive events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Our approach couples the galaxy formation model GAMESH with cluster population synthesis codes to trace the cosmic evolution of globular clusters simultaneously with mergers of massive black holes. Our reference model, which includes prescriptions for both cluster formation and disruption depending on properties of specific galaxies, accurately reproduces the observed age-mass distribution of the Milky Way globular clusters. We find that approximately 30% of the globular clusters observed in our galaxy's halo may have originated from satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. We confirm that hierarchical black hole mergers provide a significant contribution to the formation of black holes in and above the pair-instability mass gap. However, quantifying their contribution is challenging, as different population synthesis codes yield divergent results in terms of black hole mass function and merger rates. Furthermore, we characterize the host galaxies where massive black holes form in terms of their dark matter, stellar mass, and metallicity. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the merger and birth rate densities of binary black holes increase with redshift till z = 5. This cosmic evolution is a crucial signature with significant implications for future detectors like the LISA, the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, which will be capable to probe the high-redshift Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide energetic feedback necessary to `turn off' star formation in high-mass galaxies (M$_{\rm halo} \geq $ 10$^{12.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, $10.4 \leq \log(\frac{M_*}{M_\odot}) \leq 11$) as observed. Cosmic rays (CRs) have been proposed as a promising channel of AGN feedback, but the nature of CR feedback from AGN remains uncertain. We analyze a set of high-resolution simulations of massive galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-3) project including multi-channel AGN feedback, explicitly evolving kinetic/mechanical, radiative, and spectrally-resolved CRs from the central black hole. Specifically, we explore different CR feedback and transport assumptions, calibrated to Milky Way local ISM constraints, and compare them to observed galaxy scaling relations. We find that all parameterizations explored self-regulate within agreement with observed galaxy scaling relations, demonstrating that CR injection efficiencies varied by $\sim$1.5 dex and locally-variable transport produce quenched galaxies with reasonable bulk properties; however, they feature orders-of-magnitude variant circumgalactic medium (CGM) gas properties. Our results indicate that multi-wavelength synthetic observations probing these varied halo properties from larger simulated samples in conjunction with observational comparisons may place novel constraints on how AGN physically quench star formation in massive galaxies.

 - **Abstract**
 Machine learning is a field that has been growing in importance since the early 2010s due to the increasing accuracy of classification models and hardware advances that have enabled faster training on large datasets. In the field of astronomy, tree-based models and simple neural networks have recently garnered attention as a means of classifying celestial objects based on photometric data. We apply common tree-based models to assess performance of these models for discriminating objects with similar photometric signals, pulsars and black holes. We also train a RNN on a downsampled and normalized version of the raw signal data to examine its potential as a model capable of object discrimination and classification in real-time.

 - **Abstract**
 Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), as one of the earliest processes in the universe accessible to direct observation, offers a powerful and independent probe of the cosmic expansion history. With recent advances in both theory and observation, including efficient and flexible BBN codes, percent-level measurements of primordial deuterium and helium-4 abundances, refined measurements of nuclear reaction rates, and precise determinations of the baryon density from the cosmic microwave background, particularly keen insights can be gained from BBN. In this work, we leverage these developments to place model-independent constraints on deviations from the Standard Model expansion history during BBN. Using the latest abundance data, we apply principal component analysis to identify the most constrained and physically meaningful modes of expansion history variation. This approach allows us to impose the most general constraints on early dark energy during the epoch of BBN. We further examine whether general modifications to the expansion rate could alleviate the long-standing lithium problem. Our results demonstrate that BBN, sharpened by modern data and statistical techniques, remains an indispensable probe of dark energy and new physics in the early universe.

 - **Abstract**
 Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) surrounding supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are among the densest stellar environments in the universe. In these environments, collisions can shape the stellar mass function and produce exotic stellar populations. In this work, we investigate how stellar collisions couple with stellar evolution in the inner parsec of an NSC. We simulate the evolution of a sample of $1000$ $1$ $M_\odot$ stars embedded in a uniform cluster of dynamically relaxed 0.5 $M_\odot$ stars. Using COSMIC to evolve stellar properties in time , we track the mass, radius, and evolutionary state of the stars as they collide in the cluster. Our results show that most stars within $0.1$~pc of the SMBH experience a collision while on the main-sequence. However, outside of this distance, stars collide during the red giant phase, when the stellar radius increases dramatically. We find that the most common type of collision -- main-sequence or red giant -- over the lifetime of the cluster depends on the steepness of the stellar cusp, which determines the spatial distribution of the stars in the cluster. These results show that stellar evolution plays a fundamental role in shaping the collisional history of stars in nuclear star clusters. Lastly, we consider whether the closest known stars to the Milky Way's SMBH have experienced a collision. We estimate that several of the S-stars have a high probability of experiencing a collision over their main-sequence lifetime, perhaps with implications for their observed youth and properties.

#### The magnitude of the dark ages 21-cm signal in the context of existing early and late time constraints on $Λ$CDM

 - **Abstract**
 The dark ages 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the currently unobserved infant universe between the formation of the Cosmic Microwave Background around $z \approx 1100$ and the first galaxies around $z\approx 30$. A detection of the signal will help researchers understanding the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the expansion of the universe and any extensions to the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model that could explain the reported Cosmic Dawn 21-cm signal from EDGES and the Hubble tension. In this letter we take existing constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model from two early time probes, Planck and WMAP, and two late time probes, DES galaxy lensing and clustering and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and propagate these through to constraints on the magnitude of the dark ages 21-cm signal. We constrain the magnitude and central frequency of the signal while methodically accounting for uncertainties in the cosmological parameters. We find that within the context of our modelling assumptions and the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, the depth of the dark ages 21-cm signal is known to better than 1 mK and the central frequency to within 0.05 MHz.

#### Dark sector interactions in the $w \rightarrow -1$ limit: velocity locking in pure momentum exchange models

 - **Abstract**
 Models of interacting dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) involving pure momentum exchange are a promising avenue for resolving cosmological tensions. However, the behaviour of these interactions in the theoretically challenging limit where the DE equation of state, $w$, approaches $-1$ is not fully understood. We demonstrate that a generic feature of these models is a $w$-dependent velocity-locking mechanism, which systematically shifts the onset of matter power spectrum suppression to smaller scales as $w \rightarrow -1$. The suppression magnitude depends on the difference in fluid velocities. In this limit, however, the interaction's drag dominates over the DE pressure support and causes the DE velocity to track that of the DM fluid at larger scales. This mechanism provides a physical explanation for the weaker constraints found in the literature when $w\approx-1$ in models where the interaction strength does not explicitly depend on $w$. We also demonstrate that the common approximation of neglecting DE perturbations ($\delta_{\mathrm{DE}}=\theta_{\mathrm{DE}}=0$) fails in this limit. By artificially increasing the velocity difference between the fluids, this simplification incorrectly removes the $w$-dependent velocity-locking mechanism and erases the shift in power spectrum suppression to smaller scales. This leads to an overestimation of the constraining power of cosmological data on the interaction strength.

#### Rapid sinking and efficient mergers of supermassive black holes in compact high-redshift galaxies

 - **Abstract**
 We present a cosmological zoom-in simulation targeting the high redshift compact progenitor phase of massive galaxies, with the most massive galaxy reaching a stellar mass of $M_{\star}=8.5\times 10^{10} \ M_{\odot}$ at $z=5$. The dynamics of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is modelled from seeding down to their coalescence at sub-parsec scales due to gravitational wave (GW) emission by utilising a new version of the KETJU code, which combines regularised integration of sufficiently massive SMBHs with a dynamical friction subgrid model for lower-mass SMBHs. All nine massive galaxies included in this study go through a gas-dominated phase of early compaction in the redshift range of $z\sim 7-9$, starting at stellar masses of $M_\star\gtrsim 10^8\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and ending at a few times $M_{\star}\sim 10^9\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$. The sizes, masses and broad band fluxes of these compact systems are in general agreement with the population of systems observed with JWST known as `Little Red Dots'. In the compact phase, the stellar and SMBH masses grow rapidly, leading to a sharp decline in the central gas fractions. The outer regions, however, remain relatively gas-rich, leading to subsequent off-centre star formation and size growth. Due to the very high central stellar densities ($\rho_{\star}\gtrsim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{M_\odot/kpc^3}$), the SMBHs merge rapidly, typically just $\sim 4-35\ \mathrm{Myr}$ after the SMBH binaries have become bound. Combining KETJU with the phenomenological PhenomD model resolves the complete evolution of the GW emission from SMBH binaries through the Pulsar Timing Array frequency waveband up to the final few orbits that produce GWs observable with the future LISA mission.

 - **Abstract**
 Interacting Dark Energy (IDE) models offer a promising avenue to explore possible exchanges of energy and momentum between dark matter and dark energy, providing a dynamical extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Such interactions modify the growth of cosmic structures, imprinting distinctive signatures on the matter power spectrum that can be tested through large-scale structure (LSS) observations. In this work, we compute the one-loop corrections to the matter power spectrum in IDE models. We then reinterpret these results within the standard framework of the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS), which provides a consistent description of mildly non-linear scales and allows for reliable comparisons with observational data. We investigate two commonly studied forms of the coupling function, $Q$, namely $Q = \xi \mathcal{H} \rho_{\rm m}$ and $Q = \xi \mathcal{H} \rho_{\rm DE}$, and introduce a novel interaction term, $Q = \Gamma \, \rho_{\rm m} \, \rho_{\rm DE} \, \theta_{\rm m}$, characterized by the non-linear coupling constant $\Gamma$, which links the interaction strength to the velocity divergence of dark matter. This coupling function is proposed to isolate the effects solely of the IDE model on mildly non-linear scales. Using Full-Shape (FS) measurements of the galaxy power spectrum from BOSS DR12, we constrain the interaction rate $\Gamma$, the cosmological parameters, and the bias parameters. We find $\Gamma = 0.0039 \pm 0.0082$, which is highly consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model. This work opens the possibility of testing IDE models at mildly non-linear scales, potentially providing new insights for this class of models beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent developments in the modified harmonic and modified puncture gauges have opened new possibilities for performing stable numerical evolutions beyond General Relativity. In this work, we utilise techniques developed in the aforementioned formalisms to derive a BSSN-type formalism compatible with certain classes of modified gravity theories. As an intermediate step, we also derived modified versions of the Z4 and Z3 formalisms, thereby completing the connection between these formalisms beyond General Relativity. We then test the robustness of the new modified BSSN formalism by simulating the dynamics of black hole systems and benchmarking the results against the modified CCZ4 formulation. These developments enable the exploration of theories beyond General Relativity in many well-known Numerical Relativity codes that use different versions of the puncture gauge approach.

#### Black hole thermodynamics is gauge independent

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole thermodynamics provides a rare window into the elusive quantum nature of gravity. In the first-order formalism for gravitational theories, where torsion and gauge freedom are present, it has been suggested that the first law of black hole thermodynamics requires a specific gauge choice, which would undermine its fundamental character. By using principal fiber bundles, it has been shown that the first law is independent of this gauge choice. The present work introduces an alternative method that establishes this independence in a more direct manner, thereby reinforcing the status of the first law as a guide toward quantum gravity. This method also facilitates explicit computations of the first law and helps resolve several ambiguities that commonly appear in such analyses.

 - **Abstract**
 The event horizon of the Schwarzschild black hole has been well studied and the singular behavior of the Schwarzschild metric on horizon is understood as a coordinate singularity rather than an essential singularity. One demonstration of this non-singular behavior on horizon was provided by Fronsdal in 1959, by finding a global isometric embedding of the Schwarzschild metric into a six-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. Isometric embeddings for the Reissner-Nordström metric have also been constructed, but they only embed the region external to the inner horizon or in a single Eddington-Finkelstein patch. This paper presents a global isometric embedding for the maximally extended Reissner-Nordström spacetime into a nine-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spacetime. We present the solution in terms of explicit local four-dimensional coordinates, and also as a level-set of functions of the higher-dimensional embedding spacetime. While the Reissner-Nordström embedding presented has several similarities to the Fronsdal embedding of the Schwarzschild metric, the presence of the second horizon requires additional embedding coordinates and terms not found in the Fronsdal embedding, in order that the embedding is defined and finite on each horizon.

 - **Abstract**
 Three theoretically plausible techniques to developing a fractional scalar field cosmological model are pointed in this paper; the time-dependent kernel weighted action being then selected. Upon this choice, we proceed to establish a fractional cosmological model in $n$ dimensions considering the FLRW metric and a generalized version of the Sáez-Ballester (SB) theory. Our study focuses on the following purposes. Firstly, to investigate the fundamental gravitational structural features of the model, we analyze the dynamical behavior of the field equations, the fulfillment of the Bianchi identities, the associated conservation laws, and the application of the second Noether theorem at the background and first-order perturbation levels. Moreover, the model's distinguishing characteristics and theoretical differences from the corresponding standard scenarios are also investigated. Secondly, we aim to obtain exact analytical solutions and analyze the time evolution of key cosmological quantities, considering the integration constants influence, and the number of spacetime dimensions, and the fractional parameter effects. Furthermore, the model's predictions are compared with those of the corresponding standard models and observational data. Lastly, we propose new ideas to further generalize our model, with a focus on constructing an effective potential and investigating the conditions under which bounce solutions may emerge.

 - **Abstract**
 As in thermodynamics, the celebrated first law of black hole mechanics relates infinitesimal changes in the properties of nearby equilibrium states of black holes (without reference to any physical process that causes the transition). The second law is a qualitative statement that the area of an event horizon cannot decrease under appropriate physical assumptions. These laws are generalized. The new first law applies to black holes in general relativity that can be arbitrarily far from equilibrium and refers to \emph{finite} changes that occur due to \emph{physical processes}. The new second law is a \emph{quantitative} statement that relates the change in the dynamical horizon area with the flux of energy falling into the black hole in a physical process.6

 - **Abstract**
 We present a mechanism for the emergence of cosmic acceleration within the mean-field approximation of Group Field Theory models of quantum gravity. Depending on the interaction type, the resulting cosmological dynamics can either feature a late-time attractor corresponding to a dynamical dark energy phase, often with characteristic phantom behavior, including in models inspired by simplicial gravity, or instead support an early slow-roll inflationary epoch driven by the same underlying quantum-gravitational effects. This emergent inflation, effectively captured by a single-field description, can sustain the required expansion, naturally avoids the graceful exit problem, and appears to transition into a persistent, non-accelerating phase consistent with classical expectations.

 - **Abstract**
 A central conjecture in quantum gravity is the non-existence of global symmetries. As a fully unitary theory, there is no information loss in a UV complete quantum gravity theory. We see both these concepts reflected in the AdS/CFT correspondence, which tells us that dynamical processes in AdS are fully captured by a manifestly unitary CFT with no information loss. Furthermore, global symmetries of the CFT are dual to gauge symmetries in the AdS, which implies no global symmetry in the AdS. In this work, we provide concrete evidence for the connection between the non-existence of global symmetries and the absence of information loss in quantum gravity. We study the $\textit{island setups}$ in which a gravitational AdS is coupled with a nongravitational bath on its boundary. In such theories, the information in the AdS can be lost to the bath. We provide concrete examples with global symmetries in the island setup, from both the bottom-up and the top-down perspectives. We argue that these global symmetries are consistent due to $\textit{entanglement islands}$, in which holography is realized in a novel fashion. The global symmetries we construct are all mixed with spontaneously broken gauge symmetries. We will show that this fact has two implications: $\textbf{1)}$ The black hole hair is detectable in the bath (``wet hair"); $\textbf{2)}$ a resolution of a puzzle proposed by Harlow and Shagoulian.

#### Supersymmetric Spectral Form Factor of ABJM Theory

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the large-N index analog of the spectrum form factor for ABJM theory in the microcanonical ensemble. In the Cardy-like limit, the most dominant saddle describing the dual black hole decays rapidly at early times. However, the late-time behavior of the spectral form factor is determined by multi-cut saddles, which prevent it from decaying.

 - **Abstract**
 This thesis primarily dives into investigating the details of four-dimensional vacua within String Theory using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In the first and second part of the thesis, we study the fibred Calabi-Yau and M-theory moduli stabilization scenario. We consider both flux-stabilized models and non-perturbative stabilization methods. We perform a holographic analysis to determine the spectrum of the assumed dual $CFT_3$ to understand its AdS/CFT implications. For the flux stabilization, which relies on a large complex Chern-Simons invariant, moduli have integer dimensions similar to the DGKT flux-stabilized model in type IIA. For the non-perturbative stabilization, the results are similar to race-track models in type IIB. In the last part of the thesis, we solve the Wheeler DeWitt equation for the planar Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black hole in a minisuperspace approximation. We construct semiclassical Wheeler-DeWitt states from Gaussian wavepackets that are peaked on classical black hole interior solutions. By using the metric component $g_{xx}$ as a clock, these states are evolved through both the exterior and interior horizons. Close to the singularity, we show that quantum fluctuations in the wavepacket become important, and therefore the classicality of the minisuperspace approximation breaks down. Towards the AdS boundary, the Wheeler-DeWitt states are used to recover the Lorentzian partition function of the dual theory living on this boundary. This partition function is specified by an energy and a charge. Finally, we show that the Wheeler-DeWitt states know about the black hole thermodynamics, recovering the grand canonical thermodynamic potential after an appropriate averaging at the black hole horizon.
