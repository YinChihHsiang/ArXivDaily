 - **Abstract**
 The origin of the Universe's late-time accelerated expansion remains unknown. The General Relativistic Entropic Acceleration (GREA) theory offers a compelling alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, attributing cosmic acceleration to entropy growth associated with cosmic and black hole horizons, without invoking a cosmological constant. We test GREA against the latest DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), multiple Type Ia supernova compilations (Union3, Pantheon$\texttt{+}$, DES-SN5YR), and cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance measurements. While GREA is not nested within $\Lambda$CDM, it achieves a comparable goodness-of-fit, highlighting its potential as a theoretically motivated framework that circumvents some of the fine-tuning issues of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that the best-fit model features a transient phantom crossing at $z \lesssim 2$, with $w_a\equiv \mathrm{d} w(a=1)/\mathrm{d}a \simeq-0.3$, in good agreement with observations. However, its present-day value $w_0\equiv w(z=0)$ is tightly constrained to be $w_0\simeq-1$. Upcoming low-redshift (i.e. $z < 1$) cosmological probes, from both background and perturbations, will offer promising avenues for further exploring the viability of the GREA theory.

 - **Abstract**
 Heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), especially Compton-thick sources with line-of-sight column density ($N_{\rm H,los}$) $>$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, are critical to understanding supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth and the origin of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB). However, their observed fraction remains significantly below model predictions, due to strong absorption bias, even in the hard X-ray (i.e., above 10 keV) band. We analyze a sample of 26 nearby ($z < 0.1$) AGN from the Swift-BAT 150-month catalog, selected via mid-IR to X-ray diagnostics and observed with NuSTAR and soft X-ray telescopes (Xmm-Newton, Chandra, or Swift-xrt). Using self-consistent torus models (MyTorus, Borus02, and UXCLUMPY), we aim to constrain $N_{\rm H,los}$, the average torus column density, and other geometrical parameters of the obscuring medium. A comparative analysis among the three torus models showed that while estimates of $N_{\rm{H,los}}$ were generally in agreement, Borus02 tended to classify a slightly larger number of sources as Compton-thick AGN (CT-AGN). Building on this comparison, we benchmark two prediction schemes -- a mid-IR/X-ray relation and a machine-learning model -- against our broadband best-fit $N_{\rm H,los}$ measurements to assess which approach more effectively bridges the gap between predicted and measured obscuration, finding that while the former works effectively in the heavily obscured region (log$\rm{N_H} \gtrsim$ 23.5 $\rm{cm^{-2}}$), the latter provides improved accuracy, particularly for Compton-thin to moderately thick regimes (log$\rm{N_H} \lesssim$ 23.5 $\rm{cm^{-2}}$).

 - **Abstract**
 We present observational evidence for three massive, accreting black holes in the $z=5.0167$ galaxy J0148-4214 from JWST/NIRSpec-IFU spectroscopy. The black holes are revealed through broad H$\alpha$ emission (FWHM = 430-2920 km/s) without a forbidden-line counterpart in the bright [O III] doublet. Channel maps of the asymmetric central H$\alpha$ profile isolate two spatially distinct broad line regions (BLRs), separated by $190\pm40$ pc, while a third BLR is found in the galaxy outskirts with a projected separation of 1.7 kpc. Using single-epoch virial relations, we estimate black hole masses of $\log(M_\bullet/M_\odot)=7.9\pm0.4$ (primary central), $5.8\pm0.5$ (secondary central) and $6.3\pm0.5$ (third off-nuclear). We argue that the two central black holes will likely rapidly merge, with a simple dynamical friction time estimate of the order of 700 Myr. Assuming that also the off-nuclear black hole is in the process of sinking towards the centre, it will likely lead to a second merger, and we investigate the detection probability of such mergers with LISA. Alternatively, the third black hole may be the result of previous three-body interaction or a gravitational recoil, where our observations would provide evidence that such black holes may retain their accretion discs and BLRs even in the aftermath of such extreme dynamical interactions. The discovery of a black hole triplet at high redshift, together with other recent results on distant black hole pairs, indicates that multiple massive black hole systems were common in the early Universe. Our results highlight the importance of IFU observations for the detection of massive black hole multiplets in distant galaxies, the progenitors of massive black hole mergers that may be detected with next-generation gravitational wave observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 The Seyfert 1 galaxy J1626+5120 is estimated to host a $10^8 M_{\odot}$ black hole (BH) accreting at Eddington ratio $\dot{m}_{\text{Edd}} \approx 0.043$. Its long-term multi-band light curve data show flicker-like variations, but in a well-sampled $g$-band light curve, we are able to determine a $\simeq 329$\,d quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at a $\sim$4.53$\sigma$ significance. Six optical spectra were obtained for the source, three of which were taken by us. The spectra show that the variations were mainly because of flux changes blueward of 4000\,Å. We also analyze X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) data obtained with {\it the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift)}, which targeted the source in the past two years. X-ray and UV emissions of the source show variations correlated with optical. Time lags of four UV bands and four optical bands are determined with respect to the X-ray emission, which are consistent with a continuum reprocessing disk model. These properties point out a disk origin for the QPO, likely due to Lense-Thirring (LT) precession of the accretion flow at $\sim$20 gravitational radii of the BH. This QPO could be a key case linking sub-year long QPOs in jets, which have more cases reported, to LT precession.

#### The Draco Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy in the First Year of DESI Data

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the spatial distribution, kinematics, and metallicity of stars in the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We identify 155 high probability members of Draco using line of sight velocity and metallicity information derived from DESI spectroscopy along with {\it Gaia} DR3 proper motions. We find a mean line of sight velocity of $ -290.62\pm0.80$ km s$^{-1}$ with dispersion = $9.57^{+0.66}_{-0.62}$ km s$^{-1}$ and mean metallicity $\rm{[Fe/H]}$ = $-2.10\pm0.04$, consistent with previous results. We also find that Draco has a steep metallicity gradient within the half-light radius, and a metallicity gradient that flattens beyond the half-light radius. We identify eight high probability members outside the King tidal radius, four of which we identify for the first time. These extra-tidal stars are not preferentially aligned along the orbit of Draco. We compute an average surface brightness of 34.02 mag $\rm arcsec^{-2}$ within an elliptical annulus from the King tidal radius of 48.1 arcmin to 81 arcmin.

#### Baseline-Aware Dependence fitting for DAmping Timescales (BADDAT): A Nearly Unbiased Approach to Constraining Optical Variability Dependence on Physical Properties of Active Galactic Nuclei

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibit stochastic optical variability, commonly characterized by a damped random walk. The damping timescale is of particular interest because it is related to fundamental properties of the central black hole, such as its mass and accretion rate. However, the systematic underestimation of damping timescales caused by limited observational baselines makes it difficult to exhaustively utilize all available data. Many previous efforts have relied on strict selection criteria to avoid biased measurements, and such criteria inevitably constrain the range of AGN physical parameter space and therefore hinder robust inference of the underlying dependencies of damping timescale on AGN properties. In contrast, we introduce a novel forward modeling approach, Baseline-Aware Dependence fitting for DAmping Timescales (BADDAT), which explicitly accounts for these biases and leverages the information contained in underestimated timescale measurements. Rather than attempting to correct individual timescale measurements, BADDAT robustly constrains the population-level dependence of damping timescale on AGN physical properties. We demonstrate its effectiveness using mock light curves and show that it successfully reconciles previous inconsistent results based on two independent AGN samples. Our BADDAT method will have broad applications in AGN variability studies during the era of time-domain astronomy.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first measurement of the cross-correlation between anisotropic birefringence and galaxy number counts, utilizing polarization data from Planck NPIPE and the Quaia quasar catalog. By employing a QML/pseudo-$C_\ell$ combined estimator, we compute the angular power spectrum up to $\ell=191$ from birefringence and clustering maps at $N_{\rm side}=64$. Our analysis indicates that the observed spectrum is well consistent with the null-hypothesis, with a probability to exceed of 37% and an estimated scale-invariant amplitude of $A^{\mathcal{D}_\ell}=(2.22\pm2.09)\times10^{-4}\,\text{deg}$, at the 68% confidence level. Finally, we derive constraints on the axion-parameters within an early dark energy model of birefringence. Our findings reveal an unprecedented upper bound on the axion-photon coupling down to $g_{\phi\gamma}=10^{-15}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ for masses around $10^{-32}\,\text{eV}$ and high initial misalignment angles. This result opens a previously unexplored window in parameter space, providing the first constraint in this ultra-light mass regime.

 - **Abstract**
 This study presents an analysis of cosmological parameters, focusing on resolving the Hubble tension and constraining neutrino masses within a coupled quintom model. By utilizing datasets from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Pantheon + Analysis, Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and CMB Lensing, we explore the interplay between cosmological parameters and observational constraints. The model effectively reduces the Hubble tension, achieving a consistency in $H_0$ measurements of $1.37\sigma$ and $1.24\sigma$ for the CMB + ALL dataset For Planck 2018 and R22 respectively. Additionally, the study refines constraints on the total mass of neutrinos ($\Sigma_{m_{\nu}}$), with a finding of $0.115\,\text{eV}$ for the CMB + ALL dataset. The analysis examines the effective equation of state parameter ($w_{\text{eff}}$), indicating a transition towards a universe dominated by exotic energy forms. The combined datasets refine $w_{\text{eff}}$ to $-1.02\pm0.018$, underscoring the importance of multi-dataset integration in understanding dark energy dynamics. Furthermore, the interaction constant $\beta$ between the quintom scalar field and neutrinos is constrained to $0.65 \pm 0.12$ for the CMB + ALL dataset. The potential parameters $\lambda_{\sigma} = -2.09 \pm 0.082$ and $\lambda_{\phi} = 2.43 \pm 0.12$ are also determined, providing insights into the quintom model's implications for cosmological dynamics. This study offers compelling evidence for the coupled quintom model's capability to resolve the Hubble tension and refine constraints on neutrino properties, enhancing our understanding of the universe's evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 We study synchrotron polarization in spatially resolved horizon-scale images, such as those produced by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). In both general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations as well as simplified models of the black hole magnetosphere, the polarization angle, quantified by the complex observable arg(beta_2), depends strongly and systematically on the black hole spin. This relationship arises from the coupling between spin and the structure of the magnetic field in the emission region, and it can be computed analytically in the force-free limit. To explore this connection further, we develop a semi-analytic inflow framework that solves the time stationary axisymmetric equations of GRMHD in the black hole's equatorial plane; this model can interpolate between the force-free and inertial regimes by varying the magnetization of the inflow. Our model demonstrates how finite inertia modifies the structure of the electromagnetic field and can be used to quantitatively predict the observed polarization pattern. By comparing reduced models, GRMHD simulations, and analytic limits, we show that the observed synchrotron polarization can serve as a robust diagnostic of spin under assumptions about Faraday rotation and the emission geometry. Applied to EHT data, the model disfavors high-spin configurations for both M87* and Sgr A*, highlighting the potential of polarimetric imaging as a probe of both black hole spin and near-horizon plasma physics.

#### Twins in relativistic spacetimes: dispelling some misconceptions

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21455

 - **Abstract**
 In contrast to Newtonian physics, there is no absolute time in relativistic (Lorentzian) spacetimes. This immediately implies that two twins may, in general, age at different rates. For this to happen, there must be, of course, some asymmetry between their worldlines, along which the elapsed proper times are evaluated; such asymmetry might not be, however, so intuitively apparent. Our primary objective is to present, in a concise and didactic manner, some lesser-known results and derive novel ones from a modern, geometrical, and covariant standpoint, which aims to clarify the issue and dispel related misconceptions. First, we recall that: (i) the original ``twin paradox'' may be perfectly dealt with in special relativity (physics in a flat spacetime) and does not necessarily involve an accelerated twin. We then explore the issue of differential aging in general relativity (physics in a curved background) in the prototypical case of the vacuum Schwarzschild spacetime, considering several pairs of twins. In this context, we show that: (ii) it is not true that a twin which gets closer to the Schwarzschild horizon, by being subject to a stronger gravitational field, where time sort of slows down, should always get younger than a twin that stays further away, in a region of weaker gravitational field, and (iii) it is also false that an accelerated twin always returns younger than a geodesic one. Finally, we argue that (iv) in a generic spacetime, there is no universal correlation between the phenomena of differential aging and the Doppler effect. Two particularly pedagogical resources provided are a glossary of relevant terms and supplementary Python notebooks in a GitHub repository.

#### Black holes in higher-derivative Weyl conformal gravity

 - **Abstract**
 We obtain exact black hole solutions for static and spherically symmetric sources in a Weyl conformal gauge theory of gravity. We consider a quadratic gravitational action built from the Weyl tensor within a dilation geometry. In a post-Riemannian formulation, we derive a Weyl conformal action for a scalar-vector-tensor theory, where the scalar degree of freedom originates from the high-curvature terms and the vectorial one stems from the Weyl non-metricity condition. Adopting a static, spherically symmetric geometry, the vacuum field equations for the gravitational, scalar, and Weyl fields are obtained. Under these conditions, we find a Mannheim-Kazanas-type black hole solution, whose Rindler acceleration term depends on the Weyl gauge coupling constant. Furthermore, we show that the original theory can recover the Einstein-Hilbert action with a positive cosmological constant plus a higher-derivative term with Horndeski-like terms through a spontaneous symmetry breaking triggered by the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field. The new solution in the theory without conformal symmetry presents new terms introduced by the residual Weyl symmetry corrections. We demonstrate that in a regime where the Planck mass suppresses the higher-derivative term, the Rindler term persists in the low-energy limit.

 - **Abstract**
 Numerical relativity has produced wide-ranging influences on modern astrophysics and gravitational-wave astronomy. In this work, we develop a Python interface for the numerical relativity program AMSS-NCKU, which enables the automation of initializing and starting the AMSS-NCKU simulations and the automatically generating visualizations of the output results. Numerical relativity simulations using this Python interface have been presented through two representative examples (binary back hole and triple black hole merger processes), and well-behaved stable numerical results and the expected physical behaviors for black hole systems have been acquired. The Python operational interface significantly lowers the operational complexity of the simulation workflow of AMSS-NCKU simulations, reducing the technical barriers for freshman users.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the axial and polar perturbations of slowly rotating Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes in General Relativity, applying a perturbative double expansion. In particular, we derive the equations for $l=2$, $M_z=2$ perturbations of these objects which are parametrized by an asymmetry parameter. The equations constitute an astrophysically interesting sector of the perturbations that contribute dominantly to the gravitational wave radiation. Moreover, calculation of these modes may exhibit potential instabilities in the quadrupole sector.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the thermodynamics of $(2+1)$ dimensional BTZ black holes in the Einstein bumblebee gravity theory with spontaneous breaking of Lorentz symmetry caused by a nonzero vacuum expectation value of the vector field. We analyse corrections to black hole thermodynamics, including the non extensive Barrow entropy, parametrising quantum gravitational corrections to the Bekenstein Hawking area law. We introduce the York cavity formalism by placing the black hole in a finite isothermal cavity to obtain a properly defined canonical ensemble. Here we arrive at the corrected temperature, free energy, and stability conditions of the BTZ black hole, demonstrating the interplay among the Lorentz violating effects, the Barrow corrections to Entropy, and the boundary conditions within the cavity. Our results indicate that the collective impact of bumblebee dynamics and Barrow entropy significantly alters the phase structure, equilibrium configurations, and thermal stability of BTZ black holes. These findings provide insight into the implications of Lorentz violation and generalised entropy frameworks in lower dimensional quantum gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 Rapid and reliable detection and dissemination of source parameter estimation data products from gravitational-wave events, especially sky localization, is critical for maximizing the potential of multi-messenger astronomy. Machine learning based detection and parameter estimation algorithms are emerging as production ready alternatives to traditional approaches. Here, we report validation studies of AMPLFI, a likelihood-free inference solution to low-latency parameter estimation of binary black holes. We use simulated signals added into data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's (LVK's) third observing run (O3) to compare sky localization performance with BAYESTAR, the algorithm currently in production for rapid sky localization of candidates from matched-filter pipelines. We demonstrate sky localization performance, measured by searched area and volume, to be equivalent with BAYESTAR. We show accurate reconstruction of source parameters with uncertainties for use distributing low-latency coarse-grained chirp mass information. In addition, we analyze several candidate events reported by the LVK in the third gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-3) and show consistency with the LVK's analysis. Altogether, we demonstrate AMPLFI's ability to produce data products for low-latency public alerts.

 - **Abstract**
 The purpose of this work is to bring gravitational theories into play within the quickly developing framework of factorization algebras. We fit the causal structure of Lorentzian manifolds into categorical language, and in the globally hyperbolic case discover a convenient equivalence of coverages. Then, we show how both perturbative general relativity and perturbative conformal gravity define Batalin-Vilkovisky classical field theories. Finally, we describe how the observables of linearized general relativity define a particularly nice factorization algebra on the category of all globally hyperbolic manifolds and present a few conjectures which arise in specific cases, primarily motivated by the study of black hole entropy as a conserved Noether charge.

#### Dirac QNM spectrum from twisted semiclassical gauge theory of gravity

 - **Abstract**
 Twisted Abelian gauge theory coupled to a noncommutative (NC) Dirac field is studied in order to infer the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of the fermion matter perturbations in the vicinity of the Reissner-Nordström (RN) black hole. The action functional of the theory is invariant under the truncated NC local $U(1)_{\star}$ gauge transformations that keep the gravitational background intact. The latter, being a classical gravitational background unaffected by the NC local gauge transformations, makes the theory semiclassical. The most prominent feature of the QNM spectrum is the splitting in the total angular momentum projection due to the noncommutativity induced $SO(3) \rightarrow U(1)$ symmetry breaking pattern.

 - **Abstract**
 In the thin wall approximation, we study a class of asymptotically AdS black holes which contain a spherically symmetric vacuum bubble with a different (positive or negative) cosmological constant. Collapsing, expanding, and static bubble solutions are considered. Among these, expanding bubbles with positive cosmological constant can provide a way to apply the AdS/CFT correspondence to describe the physics of an expanding universe. We systematically study the causal structure of the solutions as a function of the cosmological constant, the mass of the black hole, and the tension of the bubble. We then compute the holographic entanglement entropy for a class of boundary subregions using extremal codimension-two surfaces as a probe. For collapsing bubbles, we find examples in which the entanglement entropy also explores the geometry inside the black hole bifurcation surface. As a complementary way to probe the interior of the bubble, we investigate almost-null radial geodesics related to the bulk-cone singularities of boundary two-point correlators. While the bulk-cone singularities for collapsing and expanding bubbles are consistent with thermalization at late time, static bubbles violate thermalization and exhibit properties similar to those of scar states.

 We discuss the notion of string entanglement in string theory, which aims to study entanglement between worldsheet Hilbert spaces rather than entanglement between spacetime Hilbert spaces defined on a time slice in spacetime. Applying this framework to the FZZ duality and its extension to a three-dimensional black hole, we argue that the thermal entropy of 2d and 3d black holes is accounted for by the string entanglement entropy between folded strings arising in the dual sine-Liouville CFT. We compute this via a worldsheet replica method and show that it decomposes into two parts, which we call the vertex operator contribution and the replica contribution. The former can be evaluated analytically and is shown to coincide with the black hole thermal entropies in the low temperature limit in large D dimensions. Although a computation of the latter is left as an open problem, we present evidence that it captures the remaining portion of the black hole entropy.

 - **Abstract**
 The double copy relates scattering amplitudes and classical solutions in non-abelian gauge theories and gravity. As such, it is usually expressed in the conventional second-order formalisms in both theories corresponding to standard Yang-Mills theory, and the Einstein--Hilbert action in General Relativity. In this paper, we instead consider alternative formulations of gravity, which are known to terminate at finite order in the coupling at Lagrangian level. We focus in particular on the Chern--Simons--Witten (CSW) formulation in 2+1 dimensions, and argue that the double copy then becomes a doppelgänger relationship between gauge theory and gravity, allowing straightforward replacement of generators and structure constants in both theories. We show how explicit (multiple) static point-source solutions can be mapped in the two approaches, and use the CSW formalism to examine when double copies are expected to be possible, and when not. In addition, we present an explicit double copy between the Wong equations for colour charges, and the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations for spinning particles, that extends also to higher dimensions.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we argue that the information load carried by a black hole affects its classical perturbations. We refer to this phenomenon as the ``swift memory burden effect" and show that it is universal for objects of high efficiency of information storage. The effect is expected to have observable manifestations, for example, in mergers of astrophysical black holes in Einstein gravity. The black holes with different information loads, although degenerate in the ground state, respond very differently to perturbations. The strength of the imprint is controlled by the memory burden parameter which measures the fraction of the black hole's memory space occupied by the information load. This represents a new macroscopic quantum characteristics of a black hole. We develop a calculable theoretical framework and derive some master formulas which we then test on explicit models of black holes as well as on solitons of high capacity of information storage. We show that the effect must be significant for the spectroscopy of both astrophysical and primordial black holes and can be potentially probed in gravitational wave experiments. We also provide a proposal for the test of the memory burden phenomenon in a table-top laboratory setting with cold bosons.
