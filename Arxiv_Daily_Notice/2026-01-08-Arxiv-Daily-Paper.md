 - **Abstract**
 We present the discovery of AT 2024wpp ("Whippet"), a fast and luminous 18cow-like transient. At a redshift of z=0.0868, revealed by Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectroscopy of its faint and diffuse star-forming host, it is the fourth-nearest example of its class to date. Rapid identification of the source in the Zwicky Transient Facility data stream permitted ultraviolet-through-optical observations to be obtained prior to peak, allowing the first determination of the peak bolometric luminosity (2x10^45 erg/s), maximum photospheric radius (10^15 cm), and total radiated energy (10^51 erg) of an 18cow-like object. We present results from a comprehensive multiwavelength observing campaign, including a far-UV spectrum from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope and deep imaging extending >100 days post-explosion from the Very Large Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, Very Large Array, and Atacama Large Millimetre Array. We interpret the observations under a model in which a powerful rapidly-accreting central engine blows a fast (~0.15c) wind into the surrounding medium and irradiates it with X-rays. The high Doppler velocities and intense ionization within this wind prevent any identifiable features from appearing in the ejecta or in the surrounding circumstellar material, even in the far-ultraviolet. Weak H and He signatures do emerge in the spectra after 35 days in the form of double-peaked narrow lines. Each peak is individually narrow (full width ~3000 km/s) but the two components are separated by ~6600 km/s, indicating stable structures of denser material, possibly representing streams of tidal ejecta or an ablated companion star.

 - **Abstract**
 The rotation curves of regularly rotating disc galaxies are a unique probe of the gravitational potential and dark matter distribution. Until recently, matter decomposition of rotation curves at $z>0.5$ was challenging, not only due to the lack of high resolution kinematic data but also of both suitable photometry to accurately trace the stellar surface density and spatially-resolved sub-mm observations to trace the cold gas distribution. In this paper, we analyse three galaxies from the Archival Large Program to Advance Kinematic Analysis (ALPAKA) sample, combining highly resolved cold gas observations from ALMA with rest-frame near-infrared imaging from JWST to investigate their dynamical properties and constrain their dark matter halos. The galaxies, initially classified as regularly rotating discs based on ALMA observations alone, appear in JWST as extended and symmetric stellar discs with spiral arms. Our dynamical models reproduce the rotation of the discs in the outer parts well, but they systematically underpredict the inner rotation velocities, revealing a deficit of central mass relative to the data. This discrepancy indicates either an underestimation of the bulge masses due to variations in the stellar mass-to-light ratio or dust attenuation or the presence of overmassive black holes. Alternatively, it may suggest departures from standard dark-matter halo profiles, including enhanced central concentrations.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave spectral sirens can provide cosmological constraints by using the shape of the binary black hole (BBH) mass distribution (MD). However, the precision and accuracy of these constraints depends critically on the capturing all the MD features. In this work, we analyze 137 BBH events from the latest GWTC-4.0 with a novel data-driven semiparametric approach based on \textsc{Bspline} that adaptively places knots around the most informative structures in the MD, while keeping the dimensionality of the parameter space moderate. Our flexible models resolve three distinct peaks at $\sim10$, $18$, and $33\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and are statistically preferred over standard parametric models, with Bayes factors up to 226. Because these features are correlated with $H_0$, the semiparametric model yields, under different prior assumptions, 12%-21% improvement in the precision of $H_0$ relative to parametric models, providing $H_0 = 57.8^{+21.9}_{-20.6}\,\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ in the best case. Our results demonstrate that capturing the full complexity of the BBH mass distribution is essential for realizing the cosmological potential of spectral sirens as gravitational wave catalogs continue to grow.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) are a growing class of enigmatic energetic transients. They show fast rises and declines, high temperatures throughout their evolution, and non-thermal emission in radio and X-rays. Their power source is currently unknown, but proposed models include engine-driven supernovae, interaction-powered supernovae, shock cooling emission, intermediate mass black hole tidal disruption events (IMBH TDEs), and Wolf-Rayet/black hole mergers, among others. AT2024wpp is the most optically luminous LFBOT to date and has been observed extensively at multiple wavelengths, including radio, optical, UV, and X-rays. We take models from multiple scenarios and fit them to the AT2024wpp optical, radio, and X-ray light curves to determine if which of these scenarios can best describe all aspects of the data. We show that none of the multiwavelength light curve models can reasonably explain the data, although other physical arguments favour a stellar mass/IMBH TDE of a low mass star and a synchrotron blast wave. We discuss how this scenario can be tested with late-time observations, and what other scenarios could possibly explain the broadband data.

 - **Abstract**
 Stage-IV dark energy wide-field surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will observe an unprecedented number density of galaxies. As a result, the majority of imaged galaxies will visually overlap, a phenomenon known as blending. Blending is expected to be a leading source of systematic error in astronomical measurements. To mitigate this systematic, we propose a new probabilistic method for detecting, deblending, and measuring the properties of galaxies, called the Bayesian Light Source Separator (BLISS). Given an astronomical survey image, BLISS uses convolutional neural networks to produce a probabilistic astronomical catalog by approximating the posterior distribution over the number of light sources, their centroids' locations, and their types (galaxy vs. star). BLISS additionally includes a denoising autoencoder to reconstruct unblended galaxy profiles. As a first step towards demonstrating the feasibility of BLISS for cosmological applications, we apply our method to simulated single-band images whose properties are representative of year-10 LSST coadds. First, we study each BLISS component independently and examine its probabilistic output as a function of SNR and degree of blending. Then, by propagating the probabilistic detections from BLISS to its deblender, we produce per-object flux posteriors. Using these posteriors yields a substantial improvement in aperture flux residuals relative to deterministic detections alone, particularly for highly blended and faint objects. These results highlight the potential of BLISS as a scalable, uncertainty-aware tool for mitigating blending-induced systematics in next-generation cosmological surveys.

#### The steep redshift evolution of the hierarchical merger rate may cause the $z$-$χ_{\rm eff}$ correlation

 - **Abstract**
 There is growing evidence from gravitational-wave observations that some merging black holes are created from previous mergers. Using the prediction that these hierarchically-merged black holes have dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\chi \approx 0.69$, we identify a subpopulation in the gravitational-wave data consistent with a hierarchical-merger origin in dense star clusters. This subpopulation's primary mass distribution peaks at $16.7^{+3.1}_{-4.6},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, which is approximately twice as large as its secondary mass distribution's mode ($8.0^{+29.7}_{-2.3},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), and its spin tilt distribution is consistent with isotropy. Our inferred secondary mass distributions imply that isolated binary evolution may still be needed to explain the entirety of the $9\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak. Surprisingly, we find that the rate of hierarchical mergers may evolve more steeply with redshift than the rest of the population ($98.5\%$ credibility): the fraction of all binary black holes that are hierarchically formed at $z=0.1$ is $0.05^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, compared to $0.17^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$ at $z=1$. This provides an explanation for the previously-discovered broadening of the effective spin distribution with redshift. Our results have implications for star cluster formation histories, as they suggest the potential existence of a high-redshift population of massive, compact clusters.

 - **Abstract**
 Regardless of their initial spins, the merger of two roughly equal mass black holes (BHs) produces a remnant BH of dimensionless spin $0.69$. Such remnants can merge with other black holes in dense stellar environments and produce hierarchical mergers. Analyzing the latest catalog binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors, we identify a subpopulation with primary spins consistent with such hierarchical mergers. Consistent with astrophysical expectations for mergers of second generation BHs with first generation BHs, we find that this subpopulation has mass ratios below $0.59^{+0.18}_{-0.23}$. We also infer that $19$-$88\%$ of the BBH population below this mass ratio is consistent with belonging to the hierarchically-merged population. Our results offer a natural explanation for the narrowing of the effective inspiral spin distribution with mass ratio observed in other studies.

#### Jet-torus interaction revealed by sub-parsec SO absorption in NGC 1052

 - **Abstract**
 We report the first {\lambda}2-mm very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of the radio galaxy NGC 1052, conducted with the Korean VLBI Network (KVN) using a wide-band recording mode. Leveraging the wide bandwidth covering a velocity range at 2300 km/s, we successfully detect broad (> 700 km/s) multi-component SO J_N = 3_3 - 2_2 absorption against the sub-parsec-scale continuum structure. The absorption profile consists of both redshifted and blueshifted components, including a newly identified blueshifted feature at -412 km/s relative to the systemic velocity. Significant SO absorption is confined to the central components, with no substantial detection toward the outer jet components. This constrains the location of SO gas to a compact region smaller than 0.45 pc in the sub-parsec vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). Our results support the scenario in which SO molecules are evaporated through shock heating caused by jet-torus interaction. The SO gas clumps are likely driven outward by the jet, with some returning toward the SMBH as inflowing material. Comparison with 321 GHz H2O masers reveals partial similarities in spatial distribution and radial velocity, suggesting that the jet-torus interaction may also trigger the excitation of H2O masers.

#### Characteristics of the High-frequency Humps in the Black hole X-ray Binary Swift J1727.8--1613

 - **Abstract**
 We present a detailed timing analysis of the two high-frequency humps observed in the power density spectrum of Swift J1727.8--1613 up to 100 keV, using data from the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT). Our analysis reveals that the characteristic frequencies of the humps increase with energy up to $\sim30$ keV, followed by a plateau at higher energies. The fractional rms amplitudes of the humps increase with energy, reaching approximately 15\% in the 50-100 keV band. The lag spectrum of the hump is characterized primarily by a soft lag that varies with energy. Our results suggest that the high-frequency humps originate from a corona close to the black hole. Additionally, by applying the relativistic precession model, we constrain the mass of Swift J1727.8--1613 to $2.84 < M / M_{\odot} < 120.01$ and the spin to $0.14 < a < 0.43$ from the full-energy band dataset, using triplets composed of a type-C quasi-periodic oscillation and two high-frequency humps. When considering only the high-energy bands with stable characteristic frequencies, we derive additional constraints of $2.84 < M/M_{\odot} < 13.98$ and $0.14 < a < 0.40$.

 - **Abstract**
 The accelerated expansion of the Universe remains one of the central open problems in modern cosmology. While the $\Lambda$CDM model successfully describes a wide range of observations, the physical nature of dark energy is still unknown, motivating the study of alternative theories of gravity. Among these, $f(R)$ models provide a well-established extension of General Relativity, capable of reproducing a $\Lambda$CDM-like background evolution without introducing an explicit dark energy component. However, they can induce deviations in the growth of cosmic structures, making them testable through observables sensitive to cosmological perturbations. In this work, we use weak gravitational lensing to constrain several viable $f(R)$ gravity models. We analyze their impact on the matter power spectrum, as well as on the convergence and cosmic shear power spectra. Our analysis is carried out within a Bayesian framework using the \textit{Cobaya} code and its modified gravity extension, \textit{MGCobaya}, which enables consistent theoretical predictions and their comparison with current weak lensing and CMB lensing data. We find that standard cosmological parameters remain consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario for all models considered, as expected from their background degeneracy. Nevertheless, we obtain non-trivial and model-dependent constraints on the characteristic parameters of several $f(R)$ theories.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the most general and exact solution of Einstein's gravity sourced by an anisotropic fluid describing the cosmological embedding (CE) of a static and spherically-symmetric object, including black holes (BHs) or exotic compact objects, without radial energy influx and in an arbitrary Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology. This is done fully considering backreaction of the local geometry on the cosmological dynamics. Our solution is free of curvature singularities at the would-be BH event horizon, thus solving a main issue of the CE of BH solutions proposed so far. As a byproduct, we derive a new CE of the Schwarzschild BH - distinct from McVitties's original proposal - that is regular everywhere except at the central singularity.

#### Fast frequency-domain phenomenological modeling of eccentric aligned-spin binary black holes

 - **Abstract**
 We present the IMRPhenomXE frequency-domain phenomenological waveform model for the dominant mode of inspiral-merger-ringdown non-precessing binary black holes in elliptical orbits. IMRPhenomXE extends the quasi-circular IMRPhenomXAS waveform model for the dominant $(\ell, |m|) =$ (2,2) modes to eccentric binaries. For the inspiral part, orbit-averaged equations of motion within the quasi-Keplerian parametrization up to third post-Newtonian order, including spin effects, are evolved, and the waveform modes are computed using the stationary phase approximation on eccentricity expanded expressions up to $\mathcal{O}(e^{12})$. The model assumes circularization at merger-ringdown, where it adopts the underlying quasicircular IMRPhenomXAS baseline. We show that IMRPhenomXE reduces to the accurate IMPhenomXAS model in the quasi-circular limit. Compared against 186 public numerical relativity waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog with initial eccentricities up to $~0.8$, IMRPhenomXE provides values of unfaithfulness below $3\%$ for $72\%$ of simulations with initial eccentricities below 0.4. For larger eccentricities, the unfaithfulness degrades up to $\gtrsim 10\%$ due to the underlying small eccentricity expansions and additional modelling approximations. In terms of speed, IMRPhenomXE outperforms any of the existing inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric waveform models. We demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and modularity of IMRPhenomXE through injections into zero noise and parameter-estimation analyses of gravitational-wave events, showing that IMRPhenomXE is a ready-to-use waveform model for gravitational-wave astronomy in the era of rapidly growing event catalogs.

#### Probing beyond-vacuum general relativistic effects with extreme mass-ratio inspirals

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.03374

 - **Abstract**
 We examine extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) as probes of beyond-vacuum general relativistic effects, accounting for both astrophysical environments and scalar Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity. In beyond-vacuum scenarios, the evolution of an EMRI immersed in a cold dark matter environment modifies the gravitational wave flux and introduces additional dissipative effects such as dynamical friction. In parallel, in the beyond-general relativistic settings such as in sGB gravity, the inspiraling object carries an effective scalar charge and emits scalar radiation. Both environmental and modified-gravity effects modify the flux-balance law, thereby inducing changes in the EMRI dynamics. Using a two-timescale analysis within the fixed-frequency formalism, we compute leading-order corrections to the energy fluxes for quasi-circular, equatorial orbits in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes and construct the corresponding gravitational waveforms, which are used to quantify the accumulated gravitational wave dephasing and waveform mismatch relative to the vacuum general relativistic case. We further perform the Fisher Information Matrix analysis to estimate parameter correlations and the ability of future space-based detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) to disentangle environmental and modified gravity effects. Our results show that both dark matter and scalar field effects can leave measurable imprints on EMRI waveforms and that a consistent beyond-vacuum treatment is essential for robust tests of gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate superradiant scattering off a rotating regular black hole described by a black-bounce metric which generalizes the Kerr spacetime of mass $M$ and specific angular momentum $a$ through a regularization parameter $p$ and two deformation exponents $(k,n)$. Focusing on massless $(\ell,m)=(1,1)$ scalar modes, we explore the parameter space and compute amplification factors by numerically integrating the separated radial Klein-Gordon equation. We track the peak amplification and the corresponding frequency across the $(a/M,p/M)$ parameter space for several combinations of $k$ and $n$. We find that increasing $n$ systematically enhances superradiance, whereas increasing $k$ tends to suppress it. In particular, certain configurations yield amplification levels up to 98% larger than the maximum amplification for standard Kerr black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 This study evaluates the capability of future multi-band observations of gravitational waves emitted from binary black hole coalescences, utilizing joint third-generation ground-based (CE, ET) and space-based (LISA, Taiji, TianQin) detector networks, to constrain parity and Lorentz symmetry violations in the gravitational sector. We model these effects through a parameterized waveform framework that incorporates a set of parameters that quantify potential deviations from general relativity. The frequency-dependence of their effects is described by power-law indices $\beta$ (i.e., $\beta_{\bar \nu}$, $\beta_{\bar \mu}$, $\beta_{\nu}$, and $\beta_{\mu}$). By analyzing events such as a high-signal noise ratio (SNR) "golden event" like GW250114 and a massive binary system like GW231123 (total mass $190-265 M_\odot$) using two networks of ground- and space-based detectors, we demonstrate that multi-band observations can significantly improve the current constraints on Lorentz and parity violations by several order of magnitude, for both high-frequency ($\beta > 0$) and low-frequency ($\beta < 0$) modifications. Our Bayesian analysis reveals that while the exceptional SNR of the GW250114-like event yields superior constraints for high-frequency modifications ($\beta > 0$), the massive nature of GW231123 provides more stringent limits for low-frequency effects ($\beta < 0$). This work highlights the critical value of future multi-band gravitational wave astronomy for conducting precision tests of general relativity across diverse binary populations.

 - **Abstract**
 It is known that there exist theoretical limits on the mass of compact objects in general relativity. One is the Buchdahl limit for an object with an arbitrary equation-of-state that turns out to be the limit for an object with uniform density. Another one is the causal limit that is stronger than the Buchdahl limit and is related to the speed of sound inside an object. Similar theoretical limits on the mass of compact objects in deformed Hořava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity are found in this \paper. Interestingly, the both curves of the uniform density limit and the sound speed limit meet the horizon curve at the minimum of the horizon, where a black hole becomes extremal, i.e., $M=q$, considering the Kehagias-Sfetsos vacuum that is an asymptotic flat solution in the HL gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigates Lyapunov exponents of classical chaotic motion of spinning particles orbiting a Reissner-Nordström black hole and verifies the applicability of the chaos bound in the spinor field of this black hole. For a neutral particle, when its spin magnitude surpasses a specific threshold, the exponent exceeds the surface gravity, resulting in a violation of the bound. Given a fixed angular momentum, when the spin direction is opposite to that of the angular momentum, the exponent is greater than that when the two directions are aligned. For a charged particle, after considering the influence of the electromagnetic force, we find that for relatively large angular momenta, although the electromagnetic force does not change the trend of the exponent variation with respect to the spin or angular momentum and only modifies the specific values of the exponent, it still leads to violations of the bound. This result shows that the bound is violated in the spinor field.

#### Observational Signatures of Accretion Disks around a Schwarzschild Black Hole in a Hernquist Dark Matter Halo

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate how a Hernquist type dark matter (DM) halo, parametrized by its core radius $r_{s}$ and central density $\rho_{s}$, influences both the gravitational wave (GW) emission from timelike periodic orbits and the electromagnetic appearance of a thin accretion disk around a Schwarzschild black hole (BH). By analyzing the effective potential for timelike geodesics, we show that the DM halo shifts the marginally bound orbit (MBO) and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) outward, reflecting its modification of the spacetime geometry and the energy-angular momentum structure of particle motion. Employing a semi-analytical method, we compute orbital trajectories and the associated GW waveforms, revealing that the DM halo alters the characteristic zoom-whirl dynamics and induces measurable changes in waveform morphology. Furthermore, we generate direct and secondary images of the accretion disk across various observer inclinations and find that increasing $r_{s}$ or $\rho_{s}$ results in cooler, dimmer disks with modified flux distributions. Our results demonstrate that the presence of a DM halo imprints distinct signatures in both gravitational and electromagnetic observables, offering a multimessenger pathway to probe DM environments near BHs.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a mechanism for the generation of gravitationally bound dark photon halos during the matter-dominated era. Coupled to an ultralight axion field through a parity-violating Chern-Simons term, dark photons can be produced by the tachyonic instability of axion coherent oscillation. The dark photons with a net helicity lead to a metric vorticity and can generate chiral substructures. For axion masses in the range $10^{-28} \, \mathrm{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-22} \, \mathrm{eV}$, the resulting inhomogeneities collapse to form halos with masses spanning $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$ to $10^{11} \, M_{\odot}$, with halo sizes ranging from $O(1)$ to $O(10^{6}) \, \mathrm{pc}$. During halo collapse, the induced vorticity could mediate efficient angular-momentum transport, which enables monolithic collapse and provides primordial seeds for the early formation of supermassive black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 The generalized second law (GSL) of black hole thermodynamics asserts the monotonic increase of the generalized entropy combining the black hole area and the entropy of quantum fields outside the horizon. Modern proofs of the GSL rely on information theoretic methods and are typically formulated using algebras of observables defined on the event horizon together with a vacuum state invariant under horizon symmetries, inducing a geometric modular flow. In this work, we formulate a dual version of the generalized second law from the perspective of asymptotic observers at future null infinity, who do not have access to the black hole area. Our approach exploits the dependence of the second law on the choice of algebra of observables and of a reference state invariant under suitable symmetries, in close analogy with open quantum thermodynamics. Using algebraic quantum field theory and modular theory, we analyze several physically motivated vacuum states, including the Hartle Hawking state and two classes of regularized vacua. We show that, at null infinity, the monotonic quantity governing an irreversible evolution is no longer the generalized entropy, but rather a thermodynamic potential constructed from asymptotic observables. Depending on the chosen vacuum, this potential takes the form of the free energy or of a generalized grand potential built from the Bondi mass and additional (angular) mode dependent chemical potentials. The resulting inequalities define a dual generalized second law at future null infinity, which can be consistently combined with the standard GSL involving variations of the black hole area.

 - **Abstract**
 Black hole thermodynamics provides a unique setting in which general relativity, quantum field theory, and statistical mechanics converge. In semiclassical gravity, this interplay culminates in the generalized second law (GSL), whose modern proofs rely on information theoretic techniques applied to algebras of observables defined on null hypersurfaces. These proofs exhibit close structural parallels with the thermodynamics of open quantum systems governed by Markovian dynamics. In this work, we draw parallels between the dynamics of quantum fields in regions bounded by non expanding causal horizons and the thermodynamics of quantum systems weakly coupled to equilibrium reservoirs. We introduce a dictionary relating late time boundary conditions to the choice of reservoir, vacuum states to fixed points of the dynamics, and modular Hamiltonians to thermodynamic potentials. Building on results from a companion paper on dual generalized second laws at future null infinity, we show that additional terms appearing in the associated thermodynamic potentials admit a natural interpretation as work contributions. We demonstrate that certain non thermal vacuum states at null infinity allow for the operation of autonomous thermal engines and enable work extraction from the radiation. Extending the analysis to the Unruh vacuum in Schwarzschild and Kerr backgrounds, we obtain generalized grand potential type laws incorporating grey body effects and angular momentum fluxes. Altogether, our results clarify the thermodynamic description of black hole dynamics and place it within the broader framework of open quantum thermodynamics.
