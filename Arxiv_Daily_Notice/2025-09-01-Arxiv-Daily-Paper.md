 - **Abstract**
 The presence of massive black holes (BHs) exceeding $10^9\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ already at redshift $z > 6$ challenges standard models of BH growth. Super-Eddington (SE) accretion has emerged as a promising mechanism to solve this issue, yet its impact on early BH evolution in tailored numerical experiments remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the growth of BH seeds embedded in a gas-rich, metal-poor protogalaxy at $z \sim 15$, using a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations that implement a slim-disc-based SE accretion model. We explore a broad parameter space varying the initial BH mass, feedback efficiency, and spin. We find that SE accretion enables rapid growth in all cases, allowing BHs to accrete up to $10^5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ within a few $10^3$-$10^4$ years, independent of seed properties. Feedback regulates this process, both by depleting central gas and altering BH dynamics via star formation-driven potential fluctuations, yet even the strongest feedback regimes permit significantly greater growth than the Eddington-limited case. Growth stalls after less than $\sim$1 Myr due to local gas exhaustion, as no large-scale inflows are present in the adopted numerical setup. Our results show that SE accretion naturally leads to BHs that are over-massive relative to their host galaxy stellar content, consistent with JWST observations. We conclude that short, low-duty-cycle SE episodes represent a viable pathway for assembling the most massive BHs observed at early cosmic times, even starting from light seeds.

#### Cosmic Variance in Anisotropy Searches at Pulsar Timing Arrays

 - **Abstract**
 Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) analyses show evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB) with angular correlations consistent with the Hellings-Downs curve. Anisotropies are a key discriminator of the origin of this GWB, as they are expected to be at 1--20\% for astrophysical sources, but suppressed for cosmological GWBs. However, contrary to gravitational wave detectors at higher frequencies, PTAs only take a few independent measurements of a GWB and consequently are highly sensitive to cosmic variance, which induces apparent anisotropies in individual realizations of an isotropic GWB. We demonstrate explicitly that statistical inference nevertheless remains robust, i.e., measurements are consistent with the underlying assumption of isotropy. This confirms that searches for anisotropies will be able to robustly discriminate astrophysical from cosmological GWBs. En route, we demonstrate that the maximum multipole constrained by a PTA dataset scales linearly with the number of pulsars $\ell_{\rm max} \sim N_p$.

#### Probing the H0 Tension with Holographic Dark Energy in Unimodular Gravity: Insights from DESI DR2

 - **Abstract**
 Motivated by the recent baryon acoustic oscillation measurements of DESI DR2 collaboration, this works presents an extended analysis of a cosmological model based on holographic dark energy within the framework of Unimodular Gravity. We probe the model with an extensive set of observations: cosmic chronometers, Pantheon Plus$+$SH0ES Type Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 BAO distances, quasar X-ray/UV fluxes (two independent calibrations), and Planck 2018 CMB data. The results are analyzed to assess the modelś ability to alleviate the Hubble tension and, in comparison with the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, to determine which of the two scenarios is preferred according to Bayesian evidence. We conclude that the present implementation of holographic dark energy in Unimodular Gravity, while theoretically appealing, does not alleviate the Hubble tension and is not statistically preferred by Bayesian criteria when compared with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Nevertheless, in neither case does the preference become very strong or conclusive against it.

#### The Impact of Spectroscopic Redshift Errors on Cosmological Measurements

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21182

 - **Abstract**
 Spectroscopic redshift errors, including redshift uncertainty and catastrophic failures, can bias cosmological measurements from galaxy redshift surveys at sub-percent level. We investigate their impact on full-shape clustering analysis using contaminated mock catalogs. We find that redshift uncertainty introduces a damping effect on the power spectrum. This damping is scale-dependent and absorbed by counterterms in the clustering model, keeping parameter biases below $5\%$ for the DESI survey. Catastrophic failures reduce the power spectrum amplitude by an approximately constant factor scaling with contamination rate $f_c$. While this effect is negligible for the DESI ELG populations ($f_c=1\%$), the slitless-like errors, combining redshift uncertainty with $f_c=5\%$ catastrophics, introduce significant biases in cosmological constraints. For this case, shifts from $6\%$ to $16\%$ ($\sim2.2\sigma$ level) arise in estimating the fractional growth rate $df\equiv f/f^{\rm{fid}}$ and the log primordial amplitude $\ln(10^{10} A_{s})$. Applying a correction factor $(1-f_c)^2$ on the galaxy power spectrum mitigates the bias but weakens the parameter constraints due to new degeneracies. Alternatively, fixing $f_c$ to its expected value during fitting successfully restores the unbiased posterior without loss in constraint. Our results indicate that for space-based slitless surveys such as \textit{Euclid}, an accurate estimation of $f_c$ and its incorporation into the clustering model are essential to get unbiased cosmological constraints. Extending to evolving dark energy and massive neutrino cosmologies, we find that redshift errors do not bias the dark energy properties parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, but lead to slightly weaker constraints on $\sum m_\nu$.

#### The fate of rotating massive stars across cosmic times

 - **Abstract**
 The initial mass and metallicity of stars both have a strong impact on their fate. Stellar axial rotation also has a strong impact on the structure and evolution of massive stars. In this study, we exploit the large grid of GENEC models, covering initial masses from 9 to 500 $M_{\odot}$ and metallicities ranging from $Z=10^{-5}$ (nearly zero) to 0.02 (supersolar), to determine the impact of rotation on their fate across cosmic times. Using the carbon-oxygen core mass and envelope composition as indicators of their fate, we predict stellar remnants, supernova engines, and spectroscopic supernova types for both rotating and non-rotating stars. We derive rates of the different supernova and remnant types considering two initial mass functions to help solve puzzles such as the absence of observed pair-instability supernovae. We find that rotation significantly alters the remnant type and supernova engine, with rotating stars favouring black hole formation at lower initial masses than their non-rotating counterparts. Additionally, we confirm the expected strong metallicity dependence of the fates with a maximum black hole mass predicted to be below 50 $M_{\odot}$ at SMC or higher metallicities. A pair-instability mass gap is predicted between about 90 and 150 $M_{\odot}$, with the most massive black holes below the gap found at the lowest metallicities. Considering the fate of massive single stars has far-reaching consequences across many different fields within astrophysics, and understanding the impact of rotation and metallicity will improve our understanding of how massive stars end their lives, and their impact on the universe.

#### Possible Coronal Geometry in the Hard and Soft State of Black Hole X-ray Binaries from MONK Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding the coronal geometry in different states of black hole X-ray binaries is important for more accurate modeling of the system. However, it is difficult to distinguish different geometries by fitting the observed Comptonization spectra. In this work, we use the Monte Carlo ray-tracing code MONK to simulate the spectra for three widely proposed coronal geometries: sandwich, spherical, and lamppost, varying their optical depth and size (height). By fitting the simulated NuSTAR observations with the simplcut*kerrbb model, we infer the possible parameter space for the hard state and soft state of different coronal geometries. The influence of the disk inclination angle and black hole spin is discussed. We find that for the lamppost model the disk emission is always dominant, making it incompatible in the hard state. While the sandwich and spherical models can produce similar spectra in both the hard and soft states, the simulated IXPE polarimetric spectra show the potential to break this degeneracy.

#### Adaptive extended Kalman filter and laser link acquisition in the detection of gravitational waves in space

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21538

 - **Abstract**
 An alternative, new laser link acquisition scheme for the triangular constellation of spacecraft (SCs) in deep space in the detection of gravitational waves is considered. In place of a wide field CCD camera in the initial stage of laser link acquisition adopted in the conventional scheme, an extended Kalman filter based on precision orbit determination is incorporated in the point ahead angle mechanism (PAAM) to steer the laser beam in such a way to narrow the uncertainty cone and at the same time avoids the heating problem generated by the CCD camera.A quadrant photodetector (QPD) based on the Differential Power Sensing (DPS) technique, which offers a higher dynamic range than differential wavefront sensing (DWS), is employed as the readout of the laser beam spot. The conventional two stages (coarse acquisition and fine acquisition) are integrated into a single control loop. The payload structure of the ATP control loop is simplified and numerical simulations, based on a colored measurement noise model that closely mimics the prospective on-orbit conditions, demonstrate that the AEKF significantly reduces the initial uncertainty region by predicting the point ahead angle (PAA) even when the worst case scenario in SC position (navigation) error is considered.

#### Refining fundamental constants with white dwarfs: machine learning informed constraints on fine-structure constant and proton-to-electron mass ratio

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21541

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the potential variation of two fundamental constants, the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and the proton-to-electron mass ratio $\mu$, within the framework of modified gravity theories and finite-temperature effects. Utilising high-precision white dwarf observations from the Gaia-DR3 survey, we construct a robust mass--radius relation using a Bayesian-inspired machine learning framework. This empirical relation is rigorously compared with theoretical predictions derived from scalar-tensor gravity models and temperature-dependent equations of state. Our results demonstrate that both underlying gravitational theory and temperature substantially influence the inferred constraints on $\alpha$ and $\mu$. We obtain the strongest constraints as $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|=2.10^{+32.56}_{-39.26}\times10^{-7}$ and $|\Delta\mu/\mu|=1.61^{+37.16}_{-34.67}\times10^{-7}$ for modified gravity parameter $\gamma\simeq -3.69\times10^{13}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$, while for the finite temperature case, these are $|\Delta\alpha/\alpha|=1.60^{+37.31}_{-35.42}\times10^{-7}$ and $|\Delta\mu/\mu|=1.23^{+37.02}_{-35.71}\times10^{-7}$ for $T \simeq 1.1 \times 10^7\rm\, K$. These findings yield tighter constraints than those reported in earlier studies and underscore the critical roles of gravitational and thermal physics in testing the constancy of fundamental parameters.

 - **Abstract**
 With its third data release (DR3), Gaia begins unveiling dormant candidate compact object (CO) binaries with luminous companion (LC) as predicted by several past theoretical studies. To date, 3 black hole (BH), 21 neutron star (NS), and ~3200 white dwarf (WD) candidates have been identified with LCs in detached orbits using astrometry. We adopt an observationally motivated sampling scheme for the star formation history of the Milky Way, and initial zero-age main-sequence binary properties, incorporate all relevant binary interaction processes during evolution to obtain a realistic present-day intrinsic population of CO--LC binaries. We apply Gaia's selection criteria to identify the CO--LC binaries detectable using the observational cuts applicable for DR3 as well as its end-of-mission (EOM). We find that under the DR3 selection cuts, our detectable population includes no BH--LCs, approximately 10-40 NS--LCs, and around ~4300 WD--LCs. In contrast, by EOM, the expected numbers increase to 30-300 BH--LCs, 1500-5000 NS--LCs, and ~10^5-10^6 WD--LC binaries, primarily because of the significantly longer baseline of observation.

#### Power-Law and Logarithmic Entropy-Corrected Ricci Dark Energy in a Non-Flat FRW Universe with Viscous Interaction

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we consider the logarithmic-corrected and the power-law corrected versions of the holographic dark energy (HDE) model in the non-flat FRW universe filled with a viscous Dark Energy (DE) interacting with Dark Matter (DM). We propose to replace the infra-red cut-off with the inverse of the Ricci scalar curvature $R$. We obtain the equation of state (EoS) parameter $\omega_{\Lambda}$, the deceleration parameter $q$ and the evolution of energy density parameter $\omega_{\Lambda} '$ in the presence of interaction between DE and DM for both corrections. We study the correspondence of the power-law entropy corrected Ricci dark energy (PLECRDE) and the logarithmic entropy corrected Ricci dark energy (LECRDE) models with the Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG), the Modified Variable Chaplygin Gas (MVCG), the New Modified Chaplygin Gas (NMCG), the Yang-Mills (YM) and the Non Linear Electro-Dynamics (NLED) scalar field models.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21125

 - **Abstract**
 We present version 2.1 of the public code {\sc precession}, a Python module for studying the post-Newtonian dynamics of precessing black hole binaries. In this release, we extend the code to handle eccentric orbits. This extension leverages the existing numerical infrastructure wherever possible, introducing a semi-automatic method to adapt circular-orbit functions to the eccentric case via a Python decorator. Additional new features include orbit- and precession-averaged evolutionary equations for the eccentricity, as well as revised expressions to convert between post-Newtonian separation and gravitational-wave emission frequency.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent work has shown the possibility of detecting dense dark-matter distributions surrounding intermediate or extreme mass-ratio inspirals through gravitational waves using LISA. Modeling these systems requires evolving the coupled dynamics of the binary and the dark matter. This also requires setting reasonable initial conditions for the dark-matter distribution, which itself relies upon understanding the formation history of these systems. In this paper, we investigate how two aspects of these systems' formation histories shape the dark-matter distribution: accretion onto the primary and prior merger events. We model accretion by introducing a minimum allowed angular momentum of dark-matter particles, which removes such particles that would have been accreted by the primary. When simulating an inspiral within such a distribution, we find a smaller dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal from a vacuum binary as compared to an inspiral without such a cutoff, particularly for more extreme mass-ratios. We also simulate an inspiral which takes place within a dark-matter distribution that remains after a prior merger. We find that the decrease in dephasing from vacuum binaries when compared to the prior inspiral is most significant for less extreme mass-ratios. Nevertheless, the environmental effects from the dark matter for these different cases of initial data are still expected to be measurable by future space-based detectors.

#### Loopy Black-Hole Remnants

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21159

 - **Abstract**
 The quantized area predicted by loop quantum gravity suggests the existence of a lower bound for black-hole horizons. We prove this intuition within a covariant effective model for spherical loop quantum gravity, where nonsingular quasi-static black holes evaporate until their horizons attain the smallest positive eigenvalue of the area operator. Consistent with the third law of black-hole thermodynamics, this final state -- characterized by vanishing temperature and entropy -- cannot be realized in finite time. The process thus leads to the formation of stable remnants, whose estimated masses are approximately 20.94$\mu$g, lying in the Planck regime.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the spherical harmonic mode amplitudes of quasi-circular, nonprecessing binary black hole mergers using 283 numerical relativity (NR) simulations from the SXS, RIT, and MAYA catalogs. We construct fits using the leading-order post-Newtonian (PN) dependence on intrinsic parameters, replacing the PN velocity with fit coefficients. We compare these to polynomial fits in symmetric mass ratio and spin. We analyze $(\ell, m)$ modes with $\ell \leq 4$ from late inspiral ($t = -500M$ relative to the $(2,2)$ peak) to post-merger ($t = 40M$). For nonspinning systems, the $(2,2)$, $(2,1)$, and $(3,3)$ modes retain the leading-order PN dependence on mass ratio throughout the merger. Higher-order modes deviate from the PN dependence only near and after the merger, where polynomial fits of degree $N \leq 3$ can capture the amplitude behavior up to $40M$. For aligned-spin systems at fixed mass ratio, the $(2,1)$ mode retains its PN spin dependence, while the $(3,2)$ and $(4,3)$ modes exhibit a quadratic spin dependence near merger. The PN-inspired fits lose accuracy with increasing mass ratio, particularly near merger. Results broadly agree across catalogs, though discrepancies appear in the $(3,1)$, $(4,2)$, and $(4,1)$ modes, likely from resolution differences. Our results clarify the extent to which PN structure persists in mode amplitudes and show that simple polynomial models can capture strong-field behavior near merger, enabling efficient and interpretable waveform modeling in this regime.

#### Classification of global structures of evaporating regular black holes with infinite periods of time

 - **Abstract**
 We carry out model independent analyses for global structures of spherically symmetric regular black holes that evaporate and approach the extremal state spending infinite periods of time due to Hawking radiation. We assume the radius of the outer apparent horizon (outer AH) to be a decreasing function of ingoing null coordinate, and consider the three cases, Cases 1, 2, and 3, where the radius of the inner AH is a constant, increases, and decreases, respectively. A complete classification of the Penrose diagrams is presented in each case, taking account not only of the presence and absence of the event horizon but also of the relative positions of the inner and outer AHs. Sufficient conditions that lead to each type are proved, and the examples of each type are summarized. We also study the behavior of outgoing null geodesics in models where the null geodesic equation is solvable, and figure out the important factors to determine the type of a spacetime using concepts in the area of dynamical systems. The formation of a Cauchy horizon is also established in the solvable models when the event horizon is present.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we introduce a novel framework to investigate ringdown gravitational waveforms in the presence of dynamical matter fields outside the horizon of a black hole. We systematically analyze two distinct scenarios of dynamical matter fields: motion along geodesics and uniform motion with constant velocity. Our results reveal rich phenomenology in the ringdown gravitational wave signals, including the suppression or enhancement of echoes, frequency shifts in the decay oscillations, and intricate modulations of the power-law tails. Notably, we demonstrate that subluminal moving potentials can produce irregular echo patterns and shift the dominant frequencies, offering potential new observational signatures beyond the already-known ringdown analyses. This study provides a new perspective for probing dynamic environments around black holes and offers a theoretical foundation for interpreting possible deviations in future gravitational wave detections.

 - **Abstract**
 This work explores the black hole information loss paradox, a fundamental challenge in theoretical physics. It proposes insights using Holographic Entanglement Entropy (HEE) and the AdS/BCFT correspondence within Horndeski gravity. The work revisits the time-dependent behavior of HEE to probe black hole interiors and examines its implications for the Page curve, which describes the entropy evolution of Hawking radiation. It also discusses the relationship between conformal field theory (CFT) microstates and black hole thermodynamics through the AdS/BCFT correspondence, suggesting that only a subset of microstates corresponds to black holes with smooth interiors, while others may involve firewalls. The study extends black hole thermal entropy to time-dependent entanglement entropy, offering a perspective on the interplay between quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and gravity.

#### $2$-split from Feynman diagrams and Expansions

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we investigate the $2$-split behavior of tree-level amplitudes of bi-adjoint scalar (BAS), Yang-Mills (YM), non-linear sigma model (NLSM), and general relativity (GR) theories under certain kinematic conditions. Our approach begins with a proof, based on the Feynman diagram method, of the $2$-split property for tree-level BAS$\oplus$X amplitudes with $\mathrm{X}={\mathrm{YM},\mathrm{NLSM},\mathrm{GR}}$. The proof relies crucially on a particular pattern in the Feynmam rules of various vertices. Building on this, we use the expansion of X amplitudes into BAS$\oplus$X amplitudes to establish the $2$-split behavior. As a byproduct, we derive universal expansions of the resulting pure X currents into BAS currents, which closely parallel the corresponding on-shell amplitude expansions.
