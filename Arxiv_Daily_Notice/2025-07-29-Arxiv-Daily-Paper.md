#### First Temperature Profile of a Stellar Flare using Differential Chromatic Refraction
 - **Authors:** Riley Clarke, Federica Bianco, James R. A. Davenport, Jeffery Cooke, Sara Webb, Igor Andreoni, Tyler Pritchard, Aaron Roodman
 - **Subjects:** Subjects:
Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR)

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first derivation of a stellar flare temperature profile from single-band photometry. Stellar flare DWF030225.574-545707.45129 was detected in 2015 by the Dark Energy Camera as part of the Deeper, Wider, Faster Programme. The brightness ($\Delta m_g = -6.12$) of this flare, combined with the high air mass ($1.45 \lesssim X \lesssim 1.75$) and blue filter (DES $g$, 398-548 nm) in which it was observed, provided ideal conditions to measure the zenith-ward apparent motion of the source due to differential chromatic refraction (DCR) and, from that, infer the effective temperature of the event. We model the flare's spectral energy distribution as a blackbody to produce the constraints on flare temperature and geometric properties derived from single-band photometry. We additionally demonstrate how simplistic assumptions on the flaring spectrum, as well as on the evolution of flare geometry, can result in solutions that overestimate effective temperature. Exploiting DCR enables studying chromatic phenomena with ground-based astrophysical surveys and stellar flares on M-dwarfs are a particularly enticing target for such studies due to their ubiquity across the sky, and the heightened color contrast between their red quiescent photospheres and the blue flare emission. Our novel method will enable similar temperature constraints for large sample of objects in upcoming photometric surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

#### Bound dark energy: Particle origin of dark energy with DESI BAO and DES supernova data

 - **Abstract**
 The recent findings from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) indicate a preference for dynamical dark energy at a significance level above $2.5 \sigma$, with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data, favoring a time dependent equation of state $w(z)$ rather than the cosmological constant ($w = -1$). We introduce the Bound Dark Energy (BDE) model, in which dark energy arises from the lightest meson field $\phi$ in a dark SU(3) gauge group, developing dynamically through non perturbative interactions. Governed by an inverse power law potential $V(\phi) = \Lambda_c^{4+2/3}\phi^{-2/3}$, BDE features no dark energy free parameters: one less than $\Lambda$CDM ($\Lambda$) and three less than the $ w_{0}w_{a} $CDM ($ w_{0}, w_{a},\Lambda $) models. By integrating DESI BAO measurements, CMB data and Dark Energy Survey SN Ia distance data collected during the fifth year, BDE demonstrates a reduction of $42$ and $37$ percent in the reduced $\chi^{2}_{BAO}$ as well as lower AIC and BIC values compared to the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM models, respectively, while maintaining a comparable fit for both type Ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background data. Although the ($w_{0},w_{a}$) contour in BDE is 10,000 times smaller than that found in the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model, the BDE model suggests a dynamical dark energy scenario with precise values of $w_{0}=$-0.9301 $\pm$ 0.0004 and $w_{a}=$ -0.8085 $\pm$ 0.0053 while providing a consistency on the six Planck and derived parameters at the 1$\sigma$ level between BDE, $\Lambda$CDM and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM models. The critical parameters condensation energy scale $\Lambda_{c} = 43.806 \pm 0.190$ eV and epoch $a_{c} = (2.497 \pm 0.011) \times 10^{-6}$ are consistent with predictions from high energy physics.

#### From South to North: Leveraging Ground-Based LATs for Full-Sky CMB Delensing and Constraints on $r$
 - **Authors:** Wen-Zheng Chen, Yang Liu, Yi-Ming Wang, Hong Li

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19897

 - **Abstract**
 Delensing--the process of mitigating the lensing-induced B-mode contamination in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations--will be a pivotal challenge for next-generation CMB experiments seeking to detect primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) through B-mode polarization. This process requires an accurate lensing tracer, which can be obtained either through internal reconstruction from high-resolution CMB observations or from external large-scale structure (LSS) surveys. Ground-based large-aperture telescopes (LATs) are crucial for internal reconstruction, yet existing and planned facilities are confined to the southern hemisphere, limiting effective delensing to that region. In this work, we assess the impact of introducing a northern hemisphere LAT, assumed to be situated near AliCPT (hence termed Ali-like LAT, or LATN), on delensing performance and PGW detection, using simulations. Our baseline setup includes a space-based small-aperture mission (LiteBIRD-like, SAT) and a southern LAT (SO-like, LATS). External LSS tracers, which have been shown to play an important role in delensing before the availability of ultra-sensitive polarization data, are also considered. We find that southern-hemisphere internal delensing reduces the uncertainty in r by approximately 21% compared to the no-delensing case. Adding LATN enables full-sky internal delensing, achieving a further ~19% reduction--comparable to that from including LSS tracers (~17%). Once LATN is included, the marginal benefit of LSS tracers drops to ~10%. These results highlight the significant role of LATN in advancing delensing capabilities and improving PGW constraints.

#### Primordial Black Hole Triggered Type Ia Supernovae I: Impact on Explosion Dynamics and Light Curves

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21041

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass window are compelling dark matter candidates, made plausible by the existence of black holes and by the variety of mechanisms of their production in the early universe. If a PBH falls into a white dwarf (WD), the strong tidal forces can generate enough heat to trigger a thermonuclear runaway explosion, depending on the WD mass and the PBH orbital parameters. In this work, we investigate the WD explosion triggered by the passage of PBH. We perform 2D simulations of the WD undergoing thermonuclear explosion in this scenario, with the predicted ignition site as the parameter assuming the deflagration-detonation transition model. We study the explosion dynamics and predict the associated light curves and nucleosynthesis. We find that the model sequence predicts the light curves which align with the Phillip's relation ($B_{\max}$ vs. $\Delta M_{15}$). Our models hint at a unifying approach in triggering Type Ia supernovae without involving two distinctive evolutionary tracks.

 - **Abstract**
 Dark objects streaming into the solar system can be probed using gravitational wave (GW) experiments through the perturbations that they would induce on the detector test masses. In this work, we study the detectability of the resulting gravitational signal for a number of current and future GW observatories. Dark matter in the form of clumps or primordial black holes with masses in the range $10^7$-$10^{11}\,\rm{g}$ can be detected with the proposed DECIGO experiment.

#### There and back again: outspiralling motion in non-Kerr compact objects

 - **Abstract**
 In Keplerian dynamics, a test body orbiting a point particle in circular motion has a monotonically increasing frequency, with decreasing radius. If a dissipative channel is introduced, such as gravitational wave (GW) emission, (say) under the quadrupole approximation, the corresponding GW strain has an ever increasing frequency with time. A similar statement holds for equatorial motion of a test particle on the Kerr manifold, except such inspiral is cut off at the ISCO, wherein stable circular orbits cease to exist and a plunge is expected. We analyse circular timelike orbits in generic spinning spacetimes and study the conditions in which exotic motion can occur, due to the presence of non-Kerr features. In particular, we derive conditions under which an inspiral towards a compact object is naturally followed by an outspiral motion, and give concrete examples, as well as the corresponding GW phenomenology. This analysis serves both as a theoretical exploration of non-Kerrness as well as an example of a concrete smoking gun of exotic spacetimes.

#### Gravitational Wave Peep Contributions to Background Signal Confusion Noise for LISA

 - **Abstract**
 Two-body gravitational interactions will occasionally lead to a stellar-mass compact object entering a very highly eccentric orbit around a massive black hole at the center of a galaxy. Gravitational radiation damping will subsequently result in an extreme mass ratio inspiral. Much of the inspiral time of these events is spent with the compact object on a long-period orbit, with a brief burst of gravitational wave emission at periapsis firmly in the mHz band. Burst orbits have been previously modeled as parabolic, with a focus on extreme examples that could be detectable by space-based gravitational wave detectors. This work focuses on the recurring bursts called "peeps". Peeps are not likely to be individually resolvable; however, it is also important to consider them as possible sources of signal confusion noise because they do generate a signal within the LISA band with every pericenter passage. To account for peeps, we must utilize estimates for EMRI capture parameters along with tracking the massive black hole population out to a redshift of 3 using the Illustris Project. Then, this population is combined with an EMRI formation rate to estimate the number of EMRI events per unit volume for LISA. In this study, we model three different assumptions for the gravitational wave background produced by these highly eccentric peeps. We find that with our two most likely backgrounds, the signal may result in a slight rise of the LISA noise floor (SNR $\sim 0.3-2.4$); however, in the most abundant case, the background generated by these sources would be detectable on its own and likely obscure many potentially detectable sources (SNR $\sim77$).

#### Universality on thermodynamic relation with corrections in higher-dimensional de Sitter black holes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19800

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, the methodology proposed by Goon and Penco for investigating the universality on thermodynamic relations with corrections in de Sitter black holes is extended. A universal thermodynamic extremality relation, under consideration of the mass of the spacetime $M$ with various state parameters, proposed by Goon and Penco is investigated in higher dimensional spacetime, the established universal conclusions are not impacted by the convergence of energy from the coexistence region of two horizons to the point $N$ or $C$. Furthermore, by incorporating the shift of the angular momentum into our analysis, a more universal relation is derived, specifically applicable to rotating configurations. Notably, a novel conjecture is formulated that establishes a universal relationship framework connecting shifted thermodynamic quantities across arbitrary black hole backgrounds. These findings are expected to offer profound insights into the fundamental principles of quantum gravity.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19922

 - **Abstract**
 A new formalism in general relativity with a linear response relation between perturbed Einstein tensor and the stress-energy tensor is presented. Basic concepts are borrowed from statistical physics and theory of stochastic processes by extending them for a spacetime structure. We show qualitatively new results of the first applications which lay foundations for a sub-hydro mesoscopic theory in dense matter relativistic stars. This will enable one to probe structure and phenomena at intermediate scales in relativistic stars and exotic fluids that they are made up of. The overall aim is to build foundations for studying dynamical equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of astrophysical bodies based on stochastic correlations of perturbations of spacetime and matter fields. This will add to the present literature on asteroseismology a new insight in a significant this http URL is also expected that this will lead to direct or indirect observational consequences of meso scale physics under extreme conditions present in the exotic objects.

#### Thermodynamic stability of superflows in General Relativity and Newtonian gravity

 - **Abstract**
 Landau's criterion for superfluidity is a special case of a broader principle: A moving fluid cannot be stopped by frictional forces if its state of motion is a local minimum of the grand potential. We employ this general thermodynamic criterion to derive a set of inequalities that any superfluid mixture (with an arbitrary number of order parameters) must satisfy for a certain state of motion to be long-lived and unimpeded by friction. These macroscopic constraints complement Landau's original criterion, in that they hold at all temperatures, and remain valid even for gapless superfluids. Unfortunately, they are only necessary conditions for the existence of a frictionless hydrodynamic motion, since they presuppose the validity of a fluid description. However, they do provide sufficient conditions for stability against stochastic hydrodynamic fluctuations. We first formulate our analysis within the framework of General Relativity, and then we take the Newtonian limit.

#### On the Reinterpretation of Dark Energy as the Elasticity of Space

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we demonstrate that by treating space as a three dimensional elastic membrane, one can interpret the energy density stored in it as Dark Energy. In particular, we will model space as an infinitely large fundamental 3 brane and show that its vacuum stress energy tensor has the same mathematical form which one expects from the stress energy tensor describing a Lorentz invariant vacuum energy density (Dark Energy). We identify the dark-energy density with the tension of the fundamental 3 brane and thereby establish a direct correspondence between the cosmological constant and brane tension. Finally, we present a brief argument as to why the Cosmological Constant should be treated as a fundamental constant of nature, based on some light ontological discussion regarding the origin of the tension term in the broader framework of String Theory. In a forthcoming work, we will articulate a dynamical mechanism, which will be grounded in Q-theory, Hawking-Wu flux neutralization and broken super-symmetry, demonstrating the precise cancellation of vacuum energy in a manner such that the fundamental brane (spatial) tension remains the unique source of the Cosmological Constant.

#### Corrected first law of thermodynamics for dynamical regular black holes

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we establish the corrected first law of thermodynamics for dynamical regular black holes on both the event horizon and apparent horizon. We find that the temperature of dynamical regular black holes derived from the traditional first law differs from that obtained through other approaches. This indicates that, similar to static cases, the first law of thermodynamics requires correction. We then derive the corrected first law of thermodynamics from the Einstein field equations. Our analysis reveals that the corrected factor originates from the fact that the $ T^v_v $ component of the energy-momentum tensor depends on the black hole mass. This dependence implies that the mass of a regular black hole can no longer be directly identified as the internal energy, leading to the corrections of the first law of thermodynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we tested the thermal behavior of a class of regular black hole solutions defined as generalized black-bounce spacetimes. We introduce several novel configurations governed by different mass functions and geometric deformations, illustrated by parameters controlling regularity and horizon structure. Using the Hamilton Jacobi tunneling method, we compute the Hawking temperature associated with each model and analyze its dependence on the underlying parameters. We find that all proposed geometries are free of curvature singularities and exhibit positive, well defined quasi-local masses in the Hernandez Misner Sharp formalism. Also, we demonstrate that these models may possess multiple horizons, including extremal and asymmetric cases, while typically violating classical energy conditions in the vicinity of the bounce. Our results show and illustrate the structure and thermodynamic stability of these regular solutions.

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20256

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we present LensingFlow. This is an implementation of an automated workflow to search for evidence of gravitational lensing in a large series of gravitational wave events. This workflow conducts searches for evidence in all generally considered lensing regimes. The implementation of this workflow is built atop the Asimov automation framework and CBCFlow metadata management software and the resulting product therefore encompasses both the automated running and status checking of jobs in the workflow as well as the automated production and storage of relevant metadata from these jobs to allow for later reproduction. This workflow encompasses a number of existing lensing pipelines and has been designed to accommodate any additional future pipelines to provide both a current and future basis on which to conduct large scale lensing analyses of gravitational wave signal catalogues. The workflow also implements a prioritisation management system for jobs submitted to the schedulers in common usage in computing clusters ensuring both the completion of the workflow across the entire catalogue of events as well as the priority completion of the most significant candidates. As a first proof-of-concept demonstration, we deploy LensingFlow on a mock data challenge comprising 10 signals in which signatures of each lensing regime are represented. LensingFlow successfully ran and identified the candidates from this data through its automated checks of results from consituent analyses.

#### GW231123: Binary Black Hole Merger or Cosmic String?

 - **Abstract**
 The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration recently reported an exceptional gravitational-wave event, GW231123. This gravitational-wave signal was assumed to be generated from the merger of a binary black hole system, with source frame masses of $137^{+22}_{-17}~\textup{M}_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52}~ \textup{M}_\odot$ (90\% credible intervals). As seen by the two LIGO detectors, the signal has only $\sim 5$ cycles, between 30 and 80 Hz, over $\sim 10$ ms. It is of critical importance to confirm the origin of this signal. Here we present the results of a Bayesian model comparison to test whether the gravitational-wave signal was actually generated by a binary black hole merger, or emitted from cusps or kinks on a cosmic string. We find significant evidence for a binary black hole merger origin of the signal.

#### Heat Capacity and the Violation of Scaling Laws in Gravitational System

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20992

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20992

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we examine the scaling laws in gravitational system from the perspective of free energy landscape. It has been found that for some special black holes, their critical exponents are beyond mean field theory, and more surprisingly violate the scaling laws. We find that the main reason for the violation of the scaling laws is that the heat capacity at constant volume for these black holes is 0, so the critical exponent $\alpha$ is often treated as 0 and can not be derived from the scaling hypothesis while another three critical exponents can. We also find that the strange critical exponents means there is a symmetry violation in the order parameter.

#### Timelike entanglement and central charge for quantum BTZ black holes

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19813

 - **Abstract**
 We compute holographic timelike entanglement entropy for quantum BTZ black holes in a Karch-Randall braneworld scenario. These black holes are exact solutions of massive 3d gravity on the brane and are conjectured to be dual to thermal states in 2d defect CFTs, living at the interface of the brane and the boundary of the bulk $AdS_4$. Our analysis reveals an interesting relation between the tEE and the central charge pertaining to the dual CFT, which receives nontrivial corrections due to quantum backreaction effects on the Karch-Randall brane, which is explored non-perturbatively.

#### The holographic $\TTbar$ deformation of the CFT$_2$ with gravitational anomalies

High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th)
 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20292

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20292

 - **Abstract**
 We develop the holographic framework for the $\TTbar$ deformation of two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFT$_2$) with gravitational anomalies, characterized by unequal left and right central charges and holographically dual to topological massive gravity (TMG). Utilizing the mixed boundary condition prescription, we construct the deformed BTZ black hole geometry and derive the corresponding deformed energy spectrum, confirming that the universal flow equation remains valid despite the presence of gravitational anomalies. From the boundary perspective, we compute leading-order corrections to entanglement entropy and reflected entropy induced by the $\TTbar$ deformation, as well as the balanced partial entanglement entropy non-perturbatively. On the gravity side, these quantities are evaluated using spinning worldlines in the deformed bulk geometry, with results matching their field-theoretic counterparts in the high-temperature limit. We further analyze the reality condition for holographic entanglement entropy, which constrains the deformation parameter and reveals a generalized Hagedorn behavior. This Hagedorn-like transition is also independently reproduced from the asymptotic density of states in the deformed anomalous CFT$_2$, providing additional evidence for its universality.

#### Fiducial observers and the thermal atmosphere in the black hole quantum throat

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20983

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20983

 - **Abstract**
 We propose a construction of fiducial observers in the throat region of near-extremal black holes within the framework of JT quantum gravity, leading to a notion of local observers in a highly quantum regime of the gravitational field. The construction is based on an earlier proposal for light-ray anchoring to the asymptotic boundary and is uniquely fixed at the semiclassical level by demanding that the notion of time translations for an observer at the asymptotic boundary of JT gravity should be extended into the bulk as the flow of a conformal isometry. Since conformal isometries are a necessary condition for geometric modular flow, our construction is amenable as a candidate geometric gravitational dressing that may be interpreted via the modular crossed product, potentially connecting our choice of dressing with recent developments on the literature on local observables in quantum gravity. Taking this definition beyond the semiclassical regime, we compute quantum gravitational wormhole contributions to the black hole thermal atmosphere, directly producing a finite thermal entropy and leading to a quantum description of the stretched horizon in this model.
