#### Ruling out dominant electron scattering in Little Red Dots' Rosetta Stone using multiple hydrogen lines

 - **Abstract**
 The majority of Little Red Dots (LRDs) hosting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) exhibits broad H$\alpha$ emission, which recent studies propose originates from scattering off free electrons within an ionized and dense medium embedding the Broad Line Region (BLR), rather than directly from the BLR itself. This model suggests that the observed broad lines may be intrinsically narrower than observed, which would lead to black hole masses that are up to two orders of magnitude smaller than what inferred when assuming that the whole broad line comes from the BLR. To test this model, we present a joint analysis of multiple hydrogen recombination lines in the ''Rosetta Stone''AGN, the brightest known LRD at $z$=2.26. We show that H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Pa$\beta$ have different spectral profiles, which is inconsistent with the predictions of the simple electron scattering scenario. Additionally, we test a variety of exponential models and show that none of them can simultaneously reproduce all three line profiles with physically plausible parameters. The inadequacy of these models for the Rosetta Stone implies that the scenario of electron scattering by an ionized medium surrounding the BLR is not universally applicable to LRDs and AGN, and therefore provides a counterexample to the claim of a universal and systematic overestimation of black hole masses.
#### The incidence of X-ray AGN and non-AGN galaxies in the far-infrared: insights into host galaxy properties and AGN obscuration

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the far-infrared (far-IR) incidence of X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) and non-AGN galaxies as a function of stellar mass (M$_*$), star formation rate (SFR), and specific black hole accretion rate ($\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$), using data from five extragalactic fields (COSMOS, XMM-LSS, Stripe82, ELAIS-S1, and CDFS-SWIRE). We construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from optical-to-far-IR photometry to derive host galaxy properties and assess AGN obscuration. X-ray absorption is quantified using the 4XMM-DR11s catalog. Our final sample includes 172,697 non-AGN galaxies (53% Herschel-detected) and 2,417 X-ray AGN (73% Herschel-detected), with $10 < log\,[M_*/M_\sun] < 12$ and $0 < z < 2$. X-ray AGN exhibit a relatively flat far-IR detection rate across stellar mass and specific SFR ($sSFR = SFR / M_*$), unlike non-AGN galaxies, where detection correlates strongly with SFR. Among AGN, far-IR detection declines with increasing $\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$, despite rising SFR. Our results suggest X-ray AGN are preferentially found in gas-rich environments, where star formation and black hole accretion coexist. Far-IR incidence remains high across all sSFR bins, supporting a scenario in which AGN feedback regulates, rather than abruptly quenches, star formation. Comparing AGN and non-AGN SFRs without separating Herschel-detected from non-detected sources introduces biases. Obscured AGN show ~10% higher far-IR detection rates than unobscured ones, yet at similar $\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$, unobscured AGN tend to have higher SFR. This may suggest obscured AGN inhabit dustier systems with moderate star formation contributing to the far-IR. Our findings support a regulatory AGN feedback mode operating over extended timescales in gas-rich galaxies.
#### Little Red Dots As Late-stage Quasi-stars

 - **Abstract**
 We argue that the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered with the James Webb Space Telescope are quasi-stars in their late stages of evolution. Quasi-stars are hypothetical objects predicted to form following the core collapse of supermassive stars, and consist of black holes accreting from massive envelopes at a super-Eddington rate. We show that models of late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses exceeding $\sim 10\%$ of the total, predict thermal and radiative properties that are insensitive to both black hole and envelope mass, and spectrally resemble LRDs. Specifically, we show that they are likely to exhibit reddish colors, a strong Balmer break, and possess conditions favorable to the production of Balmer lines that are broadened by electron scattering. Their huge electron column densities suppress any X-rays. Late-stage quasi-stars, with black hole masses $\gtrsim 10^6 M_\odot$, should dominate the overall quasi-star population. Their short predicted lifetimes (tens of Myr), coupled with the high observed comoving density of LRDs, suggest that most or all supermassive black holes go through a quasi-star/LRD phase during their formation and growth.
#### Hiding Out at the Low End: No Gap and a Peak in the Black-Hole Mass Spectrum

 - **Abstract**
 In recent years, the existence of a gap in the mass spectrum of compact objects formed from stellar collapse, between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest black holes, has been a matter of significant debate. The presence or absence of a mass gap has implications for the supernova mechanism, as well as being a fundamental property of the compact object mass function. In X-ray binaries containing black holes a gap is observed, but it is not known whether this is representative of a true gap in the mass function or due to selection effects or systematic biases in mass estimation. Binary black hole mergers detected from gravitational waves in the GWTC-3 transient catalog furnish a large sample of several tens of low-mass black holes with a well-understood selection function. Here we analyze the \nevts{} GWTC-3 merger events (along with GW230529\_181500) with at least one black hole ($3 \, M_\odot < m_1$) and chirp masses below those of a $20\,M_\odot$--$20\,M_\odot$ merger ($\mathcal{M} < 17.41 M_{\odot}$) to uncover the structure of the low-mass black hole mass function. Using flexible parameterized models for the mass function, we find, similar to existing studies, a sharp peak in the mass function at $m \simeq (8-10 M_{\odot})$. We observe a steady decline in the merger rate to lower masses, but by less than an order of magnitude in total, and find that the first percentile of black hole masses in our most flexible model is $m_{1\%} =3.13^{+0.18}_{-0.04}$. In other words, this sample of low-mass black holes is not consistent with the existence of a mass gap.

 - **Abstract**
 The hottest, most ionized, and fastest winds driven by accretion onto massive black holes have the potential to reshape their host galaxies. Calorimeter-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is the ideal tool to understand this feedback mode, as it enables accurate estimates of physical characteristics needed to determine the wind's kinetic power. We report on a photoionization analysis of five observations of the Seyfert-1.5 galaxy NGC 4151, obtained with XRISM/Resolve in 2023 and 2024. In the Fe K band, individual spectra require as many as six wind absorption components. Slow "warm absorbers" (WAs, $v_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 100 - 1000~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$), very fast outflows (VFOs, $v_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 10^3~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1} - 10^4~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$), and ultra-fast outflows (UFOs, $v_{\mathrm{out}} \sim 10^4~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1} - 10^5~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$ or $0.033 - 0.33~c$) are detected simultaneously, and indicate a stratified, multiphase wind. Fast and variable emission components suggest that the wind is axially asymmetric. All of the wind components have mass flow rates comparable to or in excess of the mass accretion rate, though the slowest zones may be "failed" winds that do not escape. Two UFO components have kinetic luminosities that exceed the theoretical threshold of $L_{kin} \geq 0.5\% L_{Edd}$ necessary to strip the host bulge of gas and halt star formation, even after corrections for plausible filling factors. The bulk properties of the observed winds are consistent with magnetocentrifugal driving, where the density depends on radius as $n \propto r^{-1.5}$, but radiative driving and other mechanisms may also be important. Numerous complexities and variability require further analysis.

 - **Abstract**
 Constraints on the cosmological parameters of Torsion Condensation (TorC) are investigated using Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background data. TorC is a case of Poincaré gauge theory -- a formulation of gravity motivated by the gauge field theories underlying fundamental forces in the standard model of particle physics. Unlike general relativity, TorC incorporates intrinsic torsion degrees of freedom while maintaining second-order field equations. At specific parameter values, it reduces to the $\Lambda$CDM model, providing a natural extension to standard cosmology. The base model of TorC introduces two parameters beyond those in $\Lambda$CDM: the initial value of the torsion scalar field and its time derivative -- one can absorb the latter by allowing the dark energy density to float. To constrain these parameters, `PolyChord` nested sampling algorithm is employed, interfaced via `Cobaya` with a modified version of `CAMB`. Our results indicate that TorC allows for a larger inferred Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Tension analysis using the $R$-statistic shows that TorC alleviates the statistical tension between the Planck 2018 and SH0Es 2020 datasets, though this improvement is not sufficient to decisively favour TorC over $\Lambda$CDM in a Bayesian model comparison. This study highlights TorC as a compelling theory of gravity, demonstrating its potential to address cosmological tensions and motivating further investigations of extended theories of gravity within a cosmological context. As current and upcoming surveys -- including Euclid, Roman Space Telescope, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, LISA, and Simons Observatory -- deliver data on gravity across all scales, they will offer critical tests of gravity models like TorC, making the present a pivotal moment for exploring extended theories of gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a systematic analysis of automatic differentiation (AD) applications in astrophysics, identifying domains where gradient-based optimization could provide significant computational advantages. Building on our previous work with GRAF (Gradient-based Radar Ambiguity Functions), which discovered optimal radar waveforms achieving 4x computational speedup by exploring the trade-off space between conflicting objectives, we extend this discovery-oriented approach to astrophysical parameter spaces. While AD has been successfully implemented in several areas including gravitational wave parameter estimation and exoplanet atmospheric retrieval, we identify nine astrophysical domains where, to our knowledge, gradient-based exploration methods remain unexplored despite favorable mathematical structure. These opportunities range from discovering novel solutions to the Einstein field equations in exotic spacetime configurations to systematically exploring parameter spaces in stellar astrophysics and planetary dynamics. We present the mathematical foundations for implementing AD in each domain and propose GRASP (Gradient-based Reconstruction of Astrophysical Systems & Phenomena), a unified framework for differentiable astrophysical computations that transforms traditional optimization problems into systematic exploration of solution spaces. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically delineate unexplored domains in astrophysics suitable for automatic differentiation and to provide a unified, mathematically grounded framework (GRASP) to guide their implementation.
#### Probing the scalar-induced gravitational waves with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope and the Square Kilometer Array

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave astronomy presents a promising opportunity to directly observe scalar-induced gravitational waves originating from the early universe. Future experiments, including ground-based interferometers like LIGO and Virgo, the Pulsar Timing Array, and telescopes such as FAST and SKA, are poised to significantly enhance sensitivity to these gravitational waves. In this paper, we combined Cosmic Microwave Background data with upper or lower limits of the stochastic gravitational wave background provided by FAST or SKA, to constrain scalar-induced gravitational waves. To provide a comprehensive forecast, we consider two scenarios: one where FAST or SKA does not detect scalar-induced gravitational waves, thereby setting an upper limit on the fractional energy density; and another where these waves are detected successfully, thus establishing a lower limit on the fractional energy density. In the $\Lambda$CDM+$r$ model, the scalar spectral index of the power-law power spectrum is constrained to $n_s=0.9589^{+0.0021}_{-0.0011}$ from the combinations of CMB+BAO+SKA datasets in the upper limit scenario. The constraint shifts to $n_s = 0.9661^{+0.0027}_{-0.0039}$ in the lower limit scenario. Comparing with the constraint from the combinations of CMB+BAO datasets, the scalar spectral index $n_s$ exhibits significant changes, which could serve as an indicator for detecting scalar-induced gravitational waves. In the $\Lambda$CDM+$\alpha_s$+$r$ model and the $\Lambda$CDM+$\alpha_s$+$\beta_s$+$r$ model, the running of the scalar spectral index $\alpha_s$ and the running of the running of the scalar spectral index $\beta_s$ also show notable variations, suggesting potential indicators. The numerical findings clearly demonstrate the impact of the upper and lower limits provided by FAST or SKA.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nuclei (AGNs), among the universe's most luminous objects, radiate across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. They are powered by gravitational energy released from material feeding central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, current AGN theory remains largely phenomenological, relying on envisioned structures beyond accretion disks to produce broad optical emission lines (broad line regions, BLRs) and X-ray emission (corona). It struggles to explain accretion disk sizes, optical line diversity, BLR radial inflows/outflows, and crucially, rapid X-ray and optical variability (line width, line shape, inflow/outflow switch, emitting region) on timescales significantly shorter than disk accretion. Here we show that moderately eccentric flows around SMBHs-formed via circumnuclear gas accretion or tidal disruption events-generate eccentricity cascades in the BLRs (from 0.8 to 0.2 outwards), explaining multi-wavelength emission and variability. The flows' non-axisymmetric temperature structures explain dust sublimation asymmetries, different BLR components and their radial motions. The innermost BLR links to the SMBH vicinity through highly eccentric streams producing soft X-rays at periapsis. General relativistic precession further compresses these flows, generating a hard X-ray continuum near the SMBHs. Precession of the eccentric flow drives optical/X-ray variability, reproducing the observed X-ray power spectral density and occasional X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions. We thus propose eccentric accretion disks as a physical AGN model unifying the elusive BLRs and X-ray corona. This model enables detailed anatomy of AGNs and maximises their potential as cosmological standard candles.

 - **Abstract**
 We present the main-sequence binary (MSMS) Catalog derived from Gaia Data Release 3 BP/RP (XP) spectra. Leveraging the vast sample of low-resolution Gaia XP spectra, we develop a forward modeling approach that maps stellar mass and photometric metallicity to XP spectra using a neural network. Our methodology identifies binary systems through statistical comparison of single- and binary-star model fits, enabling detection of binaries with mass ratios between 0.4 and 1.0 and flux ratios larger than 0.1. From an initial sample of 35 million stars within 1 kpc, we identify 14 million binary candidates and define a high-confidence "golden sample" of 1 million binary systems. This large, homogeneous sample enables detailed statistical analysis of binary properties across diverse Galactic environments, providing new insights into binary star formation and evolution. In addition, the $\chi^2$ comparison allows us to distinguish stars with luminous companions from single stars or binaries with dark companions, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars and black hole candidates, improving our understanding of compact object populations.
#### Dynamical traction and black hole orbital migration

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the circumstances which allow a black hole to remain put at the galactic centre when the stellar core is anisotropic. We use N-body calculations to study the response of stellar orbit families embedded in a larger, isotropic isochrone (Hénon) background potential. When the BH orbits in an odd f[E,Lz] velocity distribution function, they transfer angular momentum to it. We call this dynamical traction: it takes place whenever the kinetic energy drawn from f[E,Lz] has an excess of streaming motion over its (isotropic) v-dispersion. For a dynamically cold disc, the outcome depends on both the orbit of the BH and that of a Jeans-unstable stellar sub-structures. When the stellar clumps have much binding energy, a BH may scatter off of them after they formed. In the process the BH may be dislodged from the centre and migrate outward due to dynamical traction. When the stellar clumps are less bound, they may still migrate to the centre where they either dissolve or merge with the BH. The final configuration is similar to a nuclear star cluster which may yet be moving at ~10 km/s wrt the barycentre. The angular momentum transferred to a BH by dynamical traction delays the migration to the galactic centre by several hundred million years. The efficiency of angular momentum transfer is a strong function of the fragmented (cold) state of the stellar space density. In a dynamically cold environment, a BH is removed from the central region through a two-stage orbital migration instability. A criterion against this instability is proposed in the form of a threshold in isotropic velocity dispersion compared to streaming motion. For a BH to settle at the heart of a galaxy on time-scales of ~ 300 Myr or less requires that a large fraction of Lz be dissipated, or, alternatively, that the BH grows in situ in an isotropic environment devoid of sub-structures.
#### Evidence for Intrinsic Galaxy Alignments in Ellipticity Autocorrelations out to $100 h^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}$ from SDSS Galaxies with DESI Imaging

 - **Abstract**
 Measuring the autocorrelation of galaxy shapes, the so-called intrinsic-intrinsic (II) correlation is important for both cosmology and understanding the formation of massive elliptical galaxies. However, such measurements are significantly more challenging than the cross-correlation with galaxy density (GI correlation) due to the much lower signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we report the first observational evidence for large-scale intrinsic alignments measured from the ellipticity autocorrelations, extending out to $100\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$. From SDSS and SDSS-III BOSS, we analyze over the redshift range $0.16\leq z\leq 0.70$ luminous red galaxies (LRG), LOWZ and CMASS galaxy samples, the latter two of which are cross-matched with high-quality DESI imaging data. By expanding one of the two II correlation functions, II($-$), in terms of the associated Legendre polynomials, we effectively isolate the line-of-sight projection effects and enhance the signal. The resulting correlation for all three samples exhibits a clear power-law form. We also show that combining the two II correlations, II($+$) and II($-$), increases the detection significance by $\sim 10\%$, though they appear equivalent mathematically under the linear alignment model. Importantly, this measurement opens a new observational window for probing signals uniquely encoded in shape autocorrelations, such as tensor perturbations from the gravitational waves. This analysis establishes a practical framework for probing such effects.
#### The Heavy Element Enrichment History of the Universe from Neutron Star Mergers with Habitable Worlds Observatory

 - **Abstract**
 Understanding where elements were formed has been a key goal in astrophysics for nearly a century, with answers involving cosmology, stellar burning, and cosmic explosions. Since 1957, the origin of the heaviest elements (formed via the rapid neutron capture process; r-process) has remained a mystery, identified as a key question to answer this century by the US National Research Council. With the advent of gravitational wave astronomy and recent measurements by the James Webb Space Telescope we now know that neutron star mergers are a key site of heavy element nucleosynthesis. We must now understand the heavy element yield of these events as well as mapping when these mergers occurred back through cosmic time, currently thought to peak when the universe was half its current age. This requires an extremely sensitive ultraviolet, optical, and infrared telescope which can respond rapidly to external discoveries of neutron star mergers. We here describe how the Habitable Worlds Observatory can provide the first complete answer to one of the questions of the century.

 - **Abstract**
 Analyses by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration suggest a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model when their baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and various Type Ia supernova (SNIa) samples. In this work, we systematically investigate the origin of the deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM reported in recent cosmological analyses by combining different CMB datasets, BAO measurements, and DESY5 SNIa samples within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. We find that the DESY5 SNIa sample, particularly its low-redshift component (DES-lowz), the Planck CMB data, the lensing measurements of Planck and ACT-DR6, and the DESI-DR2 BAO measurements contribute most significantly to the observed tensions. In contrast, combinations involving DES-SN, WMAP, SPT, and ACT-DR6 remain consistent with $\Lambda$CDM within $\sim1\sigma$. Our results highlight the critical impact of SNIa systematics, CMB data, and the choice of BAO dataset on constraints of dynamical dark energy models. These findings underscore the importance of improved calibration, homogeneity, and cross-validation of observational datasets to robustly assess potential deviations from the standard cosmological model.

 - **Abstract**
 Active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk provide dense environments to influence on the star formation, evolution, and migration. In AGN disks, pressure gradients and migration accelerations could create the anisotropy of the core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) when the massive stars explode at the end of their lives. In this study, we construct the equilibrium equations by considering the above two factors and then compute the light curves for three types of progenitor stars at different locations of AGN disks for the different supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, accretion efficiencies, explosion energies, and masses of ejecta. The results show that the migration acceleration has more significant effects on the anisotropic explosions than the pressure gradients of the AGN disks. The anisotropic luminosities are pronounced at large radii, and massive SMBHs would suppress the anisotropy and reduce the total luminosity.

 - **Abstract**
 Pulsars, the cosmic lighthouses, are strongly self-gravitating objects with core densities significantly exceeding nuclear density. Since the discovery of the Hulse--Taylor pulsar 50 years ago, binary pulsar studies have delivered numerous stringent tests of General Relativity (GR) in the strong-field regime as well as its radiative properties -- gravitational waves (GWs). These systems also enable high-precision neutron star mass measurements, placing tight constraints on the behaviour of matter at extreme densities. In addition, pulsars act as natural detectors for nanohertz GWs, primarily from supermassive black hole binaries, culminating in the first reported evidence of a stochastic GW background in 2023. In this article, I review key milestones in pulsar research and highlight some of contributions from my own work. After a brief overview of the gravity experiments in §1, I review the discovery of pulsars -- particularly those in binaries -- and their critical role in gravity experiments (§2) that laid the foundation for recent advances. In §3, I present the latest efforts on GR tests using the Double Pulsar and a pioneer technique to constrain the dense matter equation of state. §4 demonstrates the potential of binary pulsars on testing alternative theories to GR. Advances in nanohertz GW detection with pulsar timing arrays are discussed in §5. I outline some of the current challenges in §6 and conclude with final remarks in §7.

 - **Abstract**
 Simulate the entire GRB dynamics since its production until the jet's break-out from the star envelope is computationally expensive. In this work, we aim to investigate jet production at the black hole horizon and its subsequent evolution beyond the envelope boundary. We perform 2.5-dimensional GRMHD simulations using, as initial conditions, remapped massive star progenitors previously evolved with a state-of-the-art stellar evolutionary codes. Specifically, we adopt the Wolf-Rayet star models 12TH and 16TI from the Woosley \& Heger framework, and we evolve our own Long GRB progenitor with the MESA code. A dipolar magnetic field is imposed, with variations in field strength to explore its influence. We find that the jets are magnetically dominated, with their thermal and kinetic components remaining comparable during propagation through the stellar envelope. The cocoon is thermally dominated in most cases. Jet launching is successful when the magnetic field has a dipolar configuration and spin $a=0.9$, in contrast, a hybrid magnetic field does not result in jet formation. We observe disk formation in cases without a magnetized jet, however, the formation of a well-defined funnel is not evident and the expansion of such wind does not break the star for longer times. Our simulations show that a collapsar launches a successful, relativistic jet only when a strong, large-scale dipolar field, driving a magnetically arrested disk. Such jets collimate, accelerate, and break out of progenitor stars in $1.5\lesssim t\lesssim3.5$ s, while weaker or non-magnetised flows stall inside the star. The resulting jets have luminosities of $L_{j}\sim10^{49}$--$10^{53}\,$erg\,s$^{-1}$ and the final energy structure reveals that magnetisation distribution and progenitor stratification as the key determinants of jet structure and success.

 - **Abstract**
 Consider a system of point masses in a spherical potential. In such systems objects execute planar orbits covering two-dimensional rings or annuli, represented by the angular-momentum vectors, which slowly reorient due to the persistent weak gravitational interaction between different rings. This process, called vector resonant relaxation, is much faster than other processes which change the size/shape of the rings. The interaction is stron9gest between objects with closely aligned angular-momentum vectors. In this paper, we show that nearly parallel angular-momentum vectors may form stable bound pairs in angular-momentum space. We examine the stability of such pairs against an external massive perturber, and determine the critical separation analogous to the Hill radius or tidal radius in the three-body problem, where the angular-momentum pairs are marginally disrupted, as a function of the perturber's mass, the orbital inclination, and the radial distance. Angular-momentum pairs or multiples closer than the critical inclination will remain bound and evolve together in angular-momentum-direction space under any external influence, such as anisotropic density fluctuations, or massive perturbers. This study has applications in various astrophysical contexts, including galactic nuclei, in particular the Milky Way's Galactic centre, globular clusters, or planetary systems. In nuclear star clusters with a central super-massive black hole, we apply this criterion to the disc of young, massive stars, and show that clusters in angular-momentum space may be used to constrain the presence of intermediate-mass black holes or the mass of the nearby gaseous torus.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the cosmological implications of a tanh-parametrized scalar field model in the framework of modified $f(Q, L_{m})$ gravity by adopting the form $f(Q, L_{m})=\beta Q+\delta L_{m}$ along with a scalar field energy density $\rho_\phi = \rho_{c0} \tanh(A + Bz)$. Using MCMC methods and combining $31$ cosmic chronometer data points, $15$ BAO, DESI DR2 BAO and $1701$ Pantheon+ samples, we constrain the model parameters and obtain $H_{0}=74.284^{+4.155}_{-4.275}$, $\Omega_{m0}=0.326^{+0.093}_{-0.072}$ and $B=-0.001^{+0.030}_{-0.030}$. The model predicts a transition redshift $z_{tr}=0.5914$ and a present deceleration parameter $q_0=-0.5167$, consistent with a Universe transitioning from deceleration to acceleration. We further analyze the evolution of the EoS parameter, density components and statefinder diagnostics in which all parameters show asymptotic convergence to a de Sitter phase. Additionally, we study black hole mass accretion, showing its dependence on the scalar field dynamics. This work highlights the compatibility of tanh-scalar field forms with $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity in describing cosmic acceleration and gravitational phenomena.

 - **Abstract**
 The possibility of extracting energy from a rotating black hole via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism represents a cornerstone of relativistic astrophysics. We present general-relativistic collisionless kinetic simulations of Kerr black-hole magnetospheres covering a wide range in the black-hole spin. Considering a classical split-monopole magnetic field, we can reproduce with these ab-initio calculations the force-free electrodynamics of rotating black holes and measure the power of the jet launched as a function of the spin. The Blandford-Znajek luminosity we find is in very good agreement with analytic calculations and compatible with general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations via a simple rescaling. These results provide strong evidence of the robustness of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism and accurate estimates of the electromagnetic luminosity to be expected in those scenarios involving rotating black holes across the mass scale.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we study frozen states of charged boson stars. These solutions are globally regular and exist in a U(1) gauged scalar field model minimally coupled to gravity for suitable choices of the coupling constants. These configurations are field theoretical realizations of the Mazur-Mottola solution with a de Sitter interior, a black hole exterior and a thin shell that interpolates between the two and replaces the event horizon. We demonstrate that standard electrodynamics is sufficient to find these frozen states, but that the self-interaction of the scalar field is crucial. Adding Horndeski vector-tensor gravity to the model allows the frozen states to exist without self-interaction though. The frozen states possess one stable and one unstable lightring, the former inside the thin shell, the latter in the black hole exterior.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate an interacting dark energy-dark matter model within the quintessence framework, characterized by the coupling term $Q_0 = \alpha \kappa \rho_m \dot{\phi} \left[1 - \beta R^2/(6H^2) \right]$, and the scalar field evolves under an exponential potential $V(\phi) = V_0 e^{-\lambda \kappa \phi}$, with parameters $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\beta$. Recasting the cosmological equations into a first-order autonomous system using dimensionless variables, we perform a phase space analysis to identify conditions for stable, non-phantom accelerating attractors. The Ricci scalar term, controlled by $\beta$, significantly affects the stability of critical points, with attractors transitioning to repellers for higher values of $\beta$. We also analyze linear scalar perturbations, focusing on the matter density contrast $\delta_m$ and the growth index $\gamma$. Additionally, we compute the deceleration and jerk parameters, the Hubble rate, and the distance modulus $\mu(z)$, showing good agreement with observational data. The model naturally addresses the cosmic coincidence problem through scalar field tracking behavior. For moderate parameter values, matter perturbations continue to grow into the future, capturing both background and perturbative dynamics effectively. This framework thus offers a consistent and observationally viable approach to interacting dark energy.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper we present quasi equilibrium models of black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binaries with mass and spin values compatible with parameter estimates derived from gravitational radiation events GW200105 and GW200115, events consistent with the merger of BHNSs. Using the FUKA initial data framework, we determine the location of ISCO (Innermost Stable Circular Orbit) and radius of mass shedding. In most of the cases studied here the innermost stable orbit is located at larger separations. This is consistent with the fact that for those two events no electromagnetic counterparts have been observed since it is believed that the NS will enter into the plunge phase in a short time once the separation of the components of the binary will be smaller of ISCO. In analogy with classical binaries, we have associated to these QE sequences a Newtonian and Post Newtonian Roche Lobe analysis to verify whether the NS is filling its Roche Lobe before approaching the ISCO. For selected configurations explored here, the location of ISCO and of the orbit at which mass shedding occurs are at separation smaller than the last converged solution of our sequences. Our analysis shows that in such cases the neutron star is filling its Roche lobe suggesting that mass transfer might occur well before encountering the last stable orbit, and this should happen in catastrophic way in order to prevent any electromagnetic emissions. If this is the case, we are suggestion a third fate of the neutron star beyond the plunge or tidal disruption ones.

 - **Abstract**
 Considering an action in F(G) modified gravity, the static spherically symmetric solutions are investigated. Introducing the Lagrangian multipliers {\alpha} we obtain the Lagrangian and equations of motion. we obtain two type solutions for these models. The first case leads to Schwarzschild-de Sitter (anti de Sitter) solution and the other one, results in a new metric. At last, the event horizon, the Hawking temperature and the generalized second law of thermodynamics in the framework of the modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity for this solution as a black hole are investigated.

 - **Abstract**
 We consider a scalar-tensor theory in teleparallel gravity where a general function of the scalar field, f(phi), is non-minimally coupled to the torsion scalar T. First, we derive the field equations in this framework. Then, we study the cosmological evolution in a spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic universe described by the FRW metric, containing radiation and non-relativistic matter with energy densities rho_r and rho_m, respectively. We analyze the system as an autonomous dynamical model of dark energy. The cosmological behavior depends on the coupling function sigma = f'(phi)/sqrt(f(phi)) and the potential parameter lambda = [V'(phi) * f(phi)] / [V(phi) * f'(phi)]. A constant coupling sigma leads to a quadratic form f(phi) proportional to (phi + c)^2, while a constant lambda results in a power-law potential V(phi) proportional to f(phi)^lambda. These forms are supported by mathematical and physical considerations. We perform phase space analysis and show that lambda much greater than 1 is a necessary condition to obtain a radiation-dominated era with effective equation of state w_eff approximately 1/3 and a matter-dominated era with w_eff approximately 0. Moreover, small sigma^2 ensures radiation and matter dominance in the respective eras. Finally, we derive the necessary conditions for a viable cosmological trajectory in this setting.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate classical and semiclassical signatures of black holes in a recently proposed Proca-Gauss-Bonnet gravity model that admits asymptotically flat solutions with primary hair. Two distinct classes of spherically symmetric metrics arise from different relations between the coupling constants of scalar-tensor and vector-tensor Gauss-Bonnet interactions. For each geometry, we examine the range of parameters permitting horizon formation and analyze the motion of test particles and light rays. We compute characteristic observables including the shadow radius, Lyapunov exponent, innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) frequency, and binding energy. Additionally, we study scalar and Dirac field perturbations, derive the corresponding effective potentials, and calculate the grey-body factors (GBFs) using both the sixth-order Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method and their correspondence with quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our results show that the QNM-based approximation of GBFs is accurate for sufficiently large multipole numbers and that deviations from Schwarzschild geometry become pronounced for large values of the Proca hair and Gauss-Bonnet couplings.

 - **Abstract**
 Astronomical observations suggest that the current standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model in modern cosmology has some discrepancies when fitting the data during the whole expansion history of the universe. To solve the Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension, usually an unknown mechanism is considered that shifts the sound horizon at the decoupling era. On the other hand, dynamical dark energy models are also considered to resolve the problems of the cosmological constant, and the additional degrees of freedom require initial conditions for a solution. In this article we have considered a coupled quintessence dark energy model with a special focus on its early-time behaviour. In our solution the initial conditions are naturally decided by setting the value of the sound horizon at the recombination time, $\theta^*$. We find that during this process, $H_0$ could be derived and its value rises with the coupling strength of the interaction. We also performed the background and cosmic microwave background power spectrum analysis, and find that the existence of the interaction term affects the energy density during a narrow time interval range and shifts the early cosmic microwave background spectrum. We also constrained the parameter space of the underlying scenario using the markov chain monte carlo analysis. We find that the best-fit values of $H_0$ and $S_8$ are improved slightly for the interacting model, but not enough to release the tensions.

 - **Abstract**
 The thermodynamic inconsistency observed in regular black holes is resolved through the framework of reduced thermodynamic phase spaces. We demonstrate that regular black holes are essentially induced from singular black holes by adding an extra requirement, which imposes a constraint among black hole parameters. This constraint reduces the thermodynamic phase space, rendering the standard form of the first law of black hole thermodynamics inapplicable. Accordingly, we propose a novel methodology to study the thermodynamic properties of regular black holes. Thermodynamic quantities must be defined in the full, unconstrained thermodynamic phase space of the underlying singular black holes, only afterward is the constraint imposed to derive the consistent and meaningful thermodynamic quantities of the regular black holes. Crucially, this framework extends beyond regular black holes and applies universally to any black hole with this kind of constraint.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we employ numerical methods to investigate the fundamental properties of Hayward boson stars and the optical appearance of their accretion disks in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. Our results show that variations in the negative cosmological constant significantly affect the relationship between ADM mass and frequency, the critical magnetic monopole charge, the size of the photon ring, and the kinematic characteristics of particles at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). Through ray-tracing studies of the accretion disk's appearance, we find that for non-frozen boson stars, the absence of an event horizon leads to multiple photon rings appearing within the central shadow region. In contrast, for frozen boson stars, the presence of a critical event horizon causes their images to resemble those of Schwarzschild black holes, with no additional photon rings appearing within the shadow region. Furthermore, the negative cosmological constant significantly alters the image structure: a smaller ISCO radius leads to photon rings being obscured at specific viewing angles, preventing their appearance within the shadow region.

 - **Abstract**
 Cosmological models based on $f(G)$ gravity are efficient in fitting different observational datasets at both background and perturbation levels. This motivates the current study to take into account dynamical system analysis to investigate the matter power spectrum within the framework of modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity. After defining the dimensionless dynamical system variables for a power-law $f(G)$ model, We derive the full system of equations governing the energy density perturbations for both matter and Gauss-Bonnet fluids using the $1+3$ covariant formalism. After solving the energy density perturbation equations, we compute the matter power spectrum. The importance of studying first order perturbations for the defined $f(G)$ model and the relevance of different initial conditions in computing the matter power spectrum are also stressed. It is reported that matter power spectrum for $f(G)$ gravity, for a particular functional form of $f(G)$ model considered is not scale invariant as the case for General Relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 The growing catalog of gravitational wave (GW) detections by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration enables increasingly stringent tests of general relativity, particularly regarding possible parity and Lorentz violations. While most current analyses employ single-parameter methods, varying one deformation parameter at a time, modified gravity theories often predict multiple, coexisting deviations. In this work, we construct four specific multi-parameter GW waveform models incorporating parity- and Lorentz-violating effects and perform full Bayesian parameter estimation to compare multi-parameter and single-parameter constraints. We find that including multiple deformation parameters yields constraints on individual parameters that are generally comparable to those from single-parameter analyses, despite one specific model showing a degeneracy between the deformation parameters. Our results support the robustness of single-parameter tests for parity and Lorentz symmetry of gravity in current and future GW observations.

 - **Abstract**
 The time-like structure of the four-dimensional asymptotically flat Horndeski black holes is studied in detail. Focusing on the motion of massive neutral test particles, we construct the corresponding effective potential and classify the admissible types of orbits. The equations of motion are solved analytically, yielding trajectories expressed in terms of Weierstrass elliptic functions and elementary functions. As an application, we compute the perihelion precession as a classical test of gravity within the Solar System and use it to place observational constraints on the coupling parameter between the scalar field and gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we investigate the universal thermodynamic characteristics of black hole phase transitions in the low-temperature limit. Our results reveal that, far below the critical point, the near zero-temperature region also exhibits universal properties. By employing the Maxwell equal area law and analyzing the coexistence curve of black hole phase transitions, we derive three universal exponents: $\alpha=1$, $\beta=2$, and $\gamma=d-3$, where $d$ represents the spacetime dimension number. Furthermore, additional studies show that these exponents remain unchanged regardless of the black hole's charge and spin. These universal exponents provide valuable insights into enhancing our understanding of black hole thermodynamic phase transitions in low temperature and shed light on the fundamental aspects of quantum gravity.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from the collapse of density perturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). The PGWs' interpretation of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) corresponds to PBHs formation in the mass range $[10^{-12}-10^{-3}] M_{\odot}$. Importantly, our analysis shows that PGWs' interpretation of recent PTA data remains viable, as it does not lead to PBH overproduction. We derive the amplitude of PGWs by leveraging existing constraints on the PBH abundance across a wide mass range. Notably, these constrained amplitudes predict SGWB signals that would be detectable by future gravitational wave observatories.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the impact of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) on the thermodynamics of five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) black holes. A modified mass-temperature relation is derived under the assumption of local equilibrium, revealing that the black hole evolves into a stable remnant with a finite temperature, rather than completely evaporating. The corrected entropy, obtained within this framework, deviates from the commonly expected logarithmic form and aligns with similar findings in higher-dimensional Schwarzschild-Tangherlini spacetimes. Our results support the argument that the GUP-induced corrections to the black hole entropy are sensitive to the dimension of spacetime.

 - **Abstract**
 Previously, we attempted to over-spin Kerr-Taub-NUT black holes with test fields satisfying the null energy condition. We derived that a non-generic over-spinning could be achieved with strict restrictions on the test field modes and the initial space-time parameters. Here, we incorporate the effect of the second order variations by evaluating the Sorce-Wald condition for Kerr-Taub-NUT black holes. We calculate the second variation of the area for the sub-collection of Kerr-Taub-NUT black holes for which over-spinning is possible due to first order perturbations. We carry out an analysis to second order, avoiding the common order of magnitude problems where the second order variations appear in the form of a product with the square of an additional small parameter. We derive that the contribution of the second order variations fix the final state of the space-time parameters driving the Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole away from extremality. The event horizon is preserved in accord with the cosmic censorship conjecture and the laws of black hole dynamics.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational-wave (GW) detection offers a novel approach to exploring intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). The GW signals from IMBH mergers mainly fall in the decihertz frequency band. The lunar-based GW detector, the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), exhibits high sensitivity in this band, making it particularly well-suited for detecting IMBHs. However, for lower-mass IMBHs, the late inspiral and merger signals enter the sensitive frequency range of ground-based GW detectors. In this work, we aim to explore how multi-band observations with LGWA and the third-generation ground-based GW detector, the Einstein Telescope (ET), can contribute to detecting the population of IMBHs. We consider three population distribution cases of IMBHs, including two population models based on astrophysical motivations and a uniform distribution, and compute the signal-to-noise ratios for LGWA, ET, and their combination to directly compare their capabilities in detecting IMBH mergers. Our results suggest that LGWA possesses strong detection capability for high-mass IMBH mergers. At redshift $z = 1$, LGWA's detection rate for IMBH binaries with primary masses above $5 \times 10^4~M_\odot$ is largely insensitive to orbital inclination and mass ratio. In contrast, ET is more suited for detecting IMBH binaries with primary masses below $10^3~M_\odot$. The multi-band observation of LGWA and ET possesses strong detection capabilities across the full IMBH mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the multi-band detection can significantly and effectively recover the IMBH population distributions. In summary, we conclude that the multi-band observations of LGWA and ET will provide powerful detection capabilities for IMBHs and are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of this important yet still poorly observed class of black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 In this paper, we consider the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime metric and investigate its aspects using the quasiperiodic oscillations and the accretion disk due to the accreting matter. First, we focus on analyzing the geodesics of particles around the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime, together with the conserved quantities such as specific energy and angular momentum for massive particles orbiting on the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs). We show that the effect of the Buchdahl parameter $\tilde{k}$ increases as the radii of the ISCO orbits decrease, resulting in shifting orbits toward the central object compared to the Schwarzschild black hole case. We also consider astrophysical epicyclic oscillations and derive their general expressions using implications of circular motion of massive particles around the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime. Further, we explore the astrophysical implications of observational higher-frequency QPOs of the selected galactic microquasars of X-ray binary systems to obtain the best-fit constraints on the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime parameters. Finally, we consider the accretion disk around the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime using implications of the ISCO parameters that define the accretion disk's inner edge. We explore radiation properties of the accretion disk and redshifted image and intensity of a lensed accretion disk around the Buchdahl-inspired spacetime.

 - **Abstract**
 The diffeomorphism covariance is a fundamental property of General Relativity which leads to the fact that the same solution of Einstein equation can be given in completely distinct forms in different coordinates system. Distinguishing or identifying two metrics as solutions of Einstein equation is particularly challenging. In a recent paper arXiv:2503.14586 [hep-th], it is proposed to apply the relations of different Weyl invariants to distinguish solutions. In this note, we present a complementary application of the Weyl invariants. We verify from Weyl invariants that two metrics with completely different forms are the same solution. We also present the coordinates transformation that connects the two metrics.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the thermodynamic properties of the apparent horizon of Friedmann-Lemaître-Roberson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. We use the generalized definition of entropy for gravity theories in higher dimensions to determine the main thermodynamic variables and to compare their behavior with the corresponding quantities in Einstein's theory, emphasizing the role of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant and the dimension number. By imposing the validity of the laws of thermodynamics, we show that the apparent horizon can be interpreted thermodynamically as a dark energy fluid, independently of the coupling constant and the dimension number. Using the response functions, we determine the adiabatic index and the number of thermally accesible degrees of freedom of the apparent horizon and argue that this leads to a discretization of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant.

 - **Abstract**
 Third-generation gravitational wave detectors such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will have significantly better sensitivities than current detectors, as well as a wider frequency bandwidth. This will increase the number and duration of the observed signals, leading to many signals overlapping in time. If not adequately accounted for, this can lead to biases in parameter estimation. In this work, we combine the joint parameter estimation method with relative binning to handle full parameter inference on overlapping signals from binary black holes, including precession effects and higher-order mode content. As this method is computationally more expensive than traditional single-signal parameter estimation, we test a prior-informed Fisher matrix and a time-frequency overlap method for estimating expected bias to help us decide when joint parameter estimation is necessary over the simpler methods. We improve upon previous Fisher matrix implementations by including the prior information and performing an optimization routine to better locate the maximum likelihood point point, but we still find the method unreliable. The time-frequency method is accurate in 86% of close binary black hole mergers. We end by developing our own method of estimating bias due overlaps, where we reweight the single signal parameter estimation posterior to quantify how much the overlapping signals affect this http URL show it has 99% accuracy for zero noise injections (98% in Gaussian noise), at the cost of one additional standard sampling run when joint parameter estimation proves to be necessary.

 - **Abstract**
 Perturbations of the Kerr black hole are notoriously difficult to describe in the metric formalism and are usually studied in terms of perturbations of the Weyl scalars. In this work, we focus on the algebraically special linear perturbations (ASLP) of the Kerr geometry and show how one can describe this subsector of the perturbations solely using the metric formulation. To that end, we consider the most general twisting algebraically special solution space of vacuum General Relativity. By linearizing around the Kerr solution, we obtain two coupled partial differential wave equations describing the dynamics of the Kerr ASLP. We provide an algorithm to solve them analytically in the small spin approximation up to third order, providing the first exact solution of this kind in the metric formulation. Then, we use this framework to study the zero modes of the Kerr geometry. We present the exact analytical form of the shifts in mass and spin together with the required change of coordinates needed to identify them. Finally, we also provide for the first time closed expressions for the solution-generating perturbations generating the NUT and acceleration charges, thus deforming the Kerr solution to the linearized Kerr-NUT and spinning C-metric. These results provide a first concrete and rare example of perturbations of the Kerr black hole which can be treated entirely in the metric formulation. They can serve as a useful testbed to search for hidden symmetries of the Kerr perturbations.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the weak cosmic censorship conjecture by analyzing the dynamics of spinning timelike particles dropped along the rotational axis of an extremal Kerr (anti)de Sitter black hole. This idea was first considered in a seminal paper by Wald and later by Needham but both analyses were restricted to asymptotically flat spacetimes. We generalize these studies, involving spinning particles, to rotating spacetimes with non vanishing cosmological constant. We examine whether the absorption of such particles can overspin the black hole beyond extremality, potentially leading to the formation of a naked singularity. In asymptotically de Sitter spacetime, we find that particles that are captured cannot overspin the black hole. For generic initial conditions, similar conclusions hold also with anti-de Sitter asymptotics. However, in this case, we identify a narrow set of finely tuned trajectories, corresponding to particles injected very close to the horizon, that lead to the disruption of the event horizon.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the power and efficiency of energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in the Kerr-Sen-AdS$_{4}$ black hole, focusing primarily on the circular orbit region and the plunging region. After introducing the black hole event horizon, boundary of the ergosphere, and photon sphere radius, we first study the energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in circular orbit region. We plot the allowed regions for energy extraction and present the energy extraction power and efficiency, comparing them with the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. It was found that energy extraction is still possible even at a spin parameter of 0.5, which is lower than previous results, and the power can be higher than the BZ process in certain regions. In addition, we find the dilatonic scalar charge $b$ and the AdS radius $l$ contribute to lowering the spin threshold required for energy extraction. We also study the energy extraction in the plunging region by analyzing the allowed regions for energy extraction, and the power as well as efficiency. It was found that the energy extraction is possible even at a spin as low as 0.25. Especially, we find that parameter $b$ promotes lowering the energy extraction spin threshold while $l$ suppresses it, which is different from the circular orbit case. Moreover, the power and efficiency of energy extraction in the plunging region are higher than in the circular orbit region, indicating a stronger energy extraction capability in the plunging region.
