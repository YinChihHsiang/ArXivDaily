#### Threading the Magellanic Needle: Hypervelocity Stars Trace the Past Location of the LMC

 - **Abstract**
 Recent discoveries have shown that a population of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) originate from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We use three such HVSs as dynamical tracers to constrain the past orbit of the LMC. Since each star was ejected at a finite time in the past, it must intersect the past position of the LMC's central black hole at its ejection time. We model the LMC's orbit under the influence of dynamical friction and extended mass distributions for both the LMC and the Milky Way, generating a large ensemble of orbital realizations. By evaluating which orbits intersect the back-integrated HVS trajectories, we compute posterior distributions over the LMC's orbital history. This approach provides significantly tighter constraints on the past motion of the LMC than previously possible. We find two previously published orbital models that are consistent with these new constraints: a first-passage trajectory from a self-consistent hydrodynamic simulation, and a second-passage trajectory from a collisionless N-body simulation. In parallel, we infer the present-day ejection site of the HVSs -- likely tracing the LMC's dynamical center and supermassive black hole -- independent of conventional methods.

 - **Abstract**
 Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are rare extragalactic events of unknown origin. Tidal disruptions of white dwarfs by intermediate mass black holes, mergers of black holes and Wolf-Rayet stars, and failed supernovae are among the suggestions. In this paper, we explore the viability of very massive star core-collapse events as the origin of LFBOTs. The appeal of such a model is that the formation of massive black holes via core collapse may yield observational signatures that can match the disparate lines of evidence that point towards both core-collapse and tidal disruption origins for LFBOTs. We explore the formation rate of massive black holes in population synthesis models, and compare the metallicities of their progenitors with the observed metallicities of LFBOT host galaxies. We further examine the composition, mass loss rates and fallback masses of these stars, placing them in the context of LFBOT observations. The formation rate of black holes with mass greater than ~30-40Msol is similar to the observed LFBOT rate. The stars producing these black holes are biased to low metallicity (Z<0.3Zsol), are H and He-poor and have dense circumstellar media. However, some LFBOTs have host galaxies with higher metallicities than predicted, and others have denser environments (plausibly due to late mass loss not captured in the models). We find that long-lived emission from an accretion disc (as implicated in the prototypical LFBOT AT2018cow) can plausibly be produced in these events. We conclude that (very) massive star core-collapse is a plausible explanation for LFBOTs. The preferred progenitors for LFBOTs in this scenario overlap with those predicted to produce super-kilonovae. We therefore suggest that LFBOTs are promising targets to search for super-kilonovae, and that they may contribute non-negligibly to the r-process enrichment of galaxies.

#### Covariant cosmography in the presence of local structures: comparing exact solutions and perturbation theory

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observational evidence of axially symmetric anisotropies in the local cosmic expansion rate motivates an investigation of whether they can be accounted for within the Lemaître-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) framework with an off-center observer. Within this setting, we compute the exact relativistic luminosity distance via the Sachs equation and compare it with the approximate expression obtained from the covariant cosmographic approach (including Hubble, deceleration, jerk and curvature parameters). This comparison allows us to identify the regimes in which the covariant cosmographic method remains reliable. In addition, we compare the LTB relativistic distance for small inhomogeneities with the corresponding result derived from linear perturbation theory (LPT) in the standard cosmological model. This analysis establishes a precise correspondence between the LTB and LPT approaches, offering a consistent dictionary for the interpretation of the observed anisotropies of the large-scale gravitational field. This analysis will be instrumental in interpreting expansion-rate anisotropies, facilitating investigations of the local Universe beyond the FLRW framework with a fully non-perturbative metric approach.

#### GRMHD modelling of accretion flow around Sagittarius A$^*$ constrained by EHT measurements

 - **Abstract**
 We study low angular momentum, advective accretion flows around a Kerr black hole within the framework of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) in the steady state. By solving the full set of GRMHD equations, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of magnetized plasma in the strong gravity regime near a rotating black hole. The accretion solutions are obtained for a set of input parameters, namely energy (${\cal E}$), angular momentum (${\cal L}$), magnetic flux ($\Phi$), and isorotation parameter ($I$). By systematically varying these parameters, we generate a family of global GRMHD accretion solutions that characterize the physical environment around the black hole. Using this approach, we investigate whether the inferred magnetic field strengths reported by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) for Sagittarius A$^*$ at various radii can be reproduced. We find that, for a broad range of parameter values, our model successfully recovers the EHT inferred magnetic field strengths with an accuracy of approximately $10\%$, offering a self-consistent framework for interpreting near-horizon accretion physics.

#### Effect of a Fine-Scale Layered Structure of the Atmosphere on Infrasound Signals from Fragmenting Meteoroids

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03655

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the influence of a fine-scale (FS) layered structure in the atmosphere on the propagation of infrasound signals generated by fragmenting meteoroids. Using a pseudo-differential parabolic equation (PPE) approach, we model broadband acoustic signals from point sources at altitudes of 35-100 km. The presence of FS fluctuations in the stratosphere (37-45 km) and the lower thermosphere (100-120 km) modifies ray trajectories, causing multiple arrivals and prolonged signal durations at ground stations. In particular, meteoroids fragmenting at 80-100 km can produce two distinct thermospheric arrivals beyond 150km range, while meteoroids descending to 50 km or below yield weak, long-lived arrivals within the acoustic shadow zone via antiguiding propagation and diffraction. Comparison with observed infrasound data confirms that FS-layered inhomogeneities can account for multi-arrival "N-waves," broadening potential interpretations of meteoroid signals. The results also apply to other atmospheric-entry objects, such as sample return capsules, emphasizing how FS structure impacts shock wave propagation. Our findings advance understanding of wavefield evolution in a layered atmosphere and have broad relevance for global infrasound monitoring of diverse phenomena (e.g., re-entry capsules, rocket launches, and large-scale explosions).

#### Formation and growth of intermediate-mass black holes in dense star clusters: Lessons from N-body and MOCCA Monte Carlo Simulations

 - **Abstract**
 Dense star clusters are promising nurseries for the formation and growth of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $\sim 10^2-10^5\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), with increasing observational evidence pointing to their presence in massive star clusters and stripped dwarf-galaxy nuclei. During the early evolution of compact clusters, massive stars can rapidly segregate to the center, where frequent collisions may trigger the runaway growth of a very massive star (VMS). This object can subsequently collapse to form an IMBH or merge with a stellar-mass black hole. We carried out direct $N$-body and Monte Carlo simulations of star clusters with initial core densities between $10^6$ to $4\times 10^8\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ and total masses of $5.9\times 10^5$ and $1.3\times 10^6\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. These models show that IMBHs of $10^3-10^4\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ can form within $\leq 5$ Myr through the runaway collision channel. At later times, the IMBHs continue to grow through mergers with black holes, stars, and compact remnants, providing predictions testable with future gravitational-wave and transient surveys.

#### Beyond CPL: Evidence for dynamical dark energy in three-parameter models

 - **Arxiv link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03779

 - **Pdf link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.03779

 - **Abstract**
 We introduce three-parameter extensions of the two-parameter minimal Akhtar-Hossain (mAH) parametrization, termed modified minimal AH (MmAH1,2), which provide greater flexibility in the dynamics of dark energy. These models are compared with $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, mAH, CPL, and three-parameter CPL (CPL-$w_{\rm b}$) using a joint data set of the CMB compressed likelihood, DESI DR2, Pantheon$+$ supernovae, $H(z)$ measurements, and redshift-space distortions. While the common cosmological parameters remain stable across models, CPL and the MmAH1,2 yield modest improvements in fit, with $\Delta\chi^2\simeq -6$ to $-7$ and corresponding $\Delta{\rm AIC}\simeq -1$ to $-2$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM, suggesting a mild preference for dynamical dark energy. Statistical consistency with $\Lambda$CDM is quantified via the Mahalanobis distance in one, two, and three dimensional parameter subspaces. In 1D, the strongest deviation occurs for MmAH1 ($2.5\sigma$), followed by CPL ($2.3\sigma$). In 2D, CPL-$w_{\rm b}$ shows the highest discrepancy ($2.3\sigma$), while other models remain at the $1.7$-$2.1\sigma$ level. In 3D, CPL-$w_{\rm b}$ continues to exhibit the largest tension ($\sim2\sigma$), though this arises in the presence of very strong correlations, particularly between $w_{\rm a}$ and $w_{\rm b}$, whereas the MmAH extensions display slightly weaker but still non-negligible discrepancies ($1.4$-$1.8\sigma$). Overall, these results indicate consistent evidence for departures from $\Lambda$CDM.

 - **Abstract**
 As a continuation of DRAGON-II, we present the DRAGON-III project, which focuses on the simulations of million-body globular clusters and nuclear clusters over 10 Gyr. We report on its preliminary results on globular clusters. The first 100 Myr of the simulations have produced 41 pulsars, 191 X-ray binaries, 17 gravitational wave sources, and one black hole-black hole merger due to the loss of orbital energy in the form of gravitational wave emission. The inclusion of initial soft binaries brings surprisingly interesting results, including one IMBH in a binary black hole, and compact object binaries resembling the Gaia-BH1 and the wide black hole-giant binary reported in Wang et al. (2024, Nat. Astro.).

#### Is CPL dark energy a mirage?

 - **Abstract**
 Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) raise doubts about the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM, suggesting a preference for an inherently dynamical dark energy component. The Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization -- a widely used two-parameter model for the dark energy equation of state -- displays marked early-time phantom behavior and a recent crossing of the phantom divide. These features suggest the convenience to check observationally the robustness of such evolution. To address this, we design two alternative families of two-parameter dark energy parameterizations which remain close to the original CPL but aim to soften its phantom character. Specifically, these models reproduce CPL-like behavior at low redshift but mitigate early phantom behavior through the use of smooth sigmoid transitions, yielding a more gradual evolution. By combining recent DESI data with constraints from the cosmic microwave background and Type Ia supernovae, we assess the viability of these models. Our analysis shows that CPL remains a strong and competitive parameterization, with the proposed alternatives only marginally favored or disfavored. We conclude that current observational data lack the statistical precision to decisively distinguish between CPL and similarly constructed parameterizations across the redshift range probed by late-time observables.

#### Limiting the Yukawa Gravity through the Black Hole Shadows of Sgr A* and M87*

 - **Abstract**
 Recently, the \textit{EHT} collaboration unveiled the shadow images of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) M87* and Sgr A*, with angular radii of $42\pm3$\,$\mu$as and $48.7\pm7.0$\,$\mu$as, respectively. These observations are consistent with the shadow of a Kerr black hole in general relativity (GR). Observations of the shadow of SMBHs can be used to test modified gravity theories, including Yukawa gravity, in extremely strong fields. In this paper, we illustrate the shadows of Yukawa black holes, showing that their sizes are significantly influenced by the Yukawa parameters $\lambda$ and $\kappa$. Using the EHT observations of M87* and Sgr A*, we obtain constraints on the Yukawa parameters. For Sgr A*, Keck and VLTI provide different priors on its gravitational radius. The Sgr A* shadow yields $\kappa=-0.04^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ for $\lambda>1$\,AU with the Keck prior, while $\kappa=-0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$ with the VLTI prior. As $\lambda$ decreases, the constraints weaken, reaching $-0.37<\kappa <0.17$ (Keck prior) and $-0.47<\kappa<0.04$ (VLTI prior) at $\lambda=0.1$\,AU. For M87*, with a mass significantly larger than Sgr A*, this system can only put constraints on $\kappa$ at larger $\lambda$. For $\lambda>1.5\times10^4$\,AU, the \textit{EHT} observation of M87* yields $\kappa=-0.01^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$. No significant deviation from GR is detected in our analysis. Additionally, we explore potential constraints using the next-generation VLBI, like \textit{ngEHT} and the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), which promise the detection of the second ring of photons. The improved angular resolution and the measurements of the second ring could substantially refine constraints on the Yukawa parameters, enhancing our ability to test deviations from GR in the strong-field regime.

 - **Abstract**
 We present measurements of the dusty torus sizes of 51 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with a redshift of $z<$ 0.8. Our analysis utilizes about 16 years of optical photometric data of 146 AGNs from various time-domain surveys, including ASAS-SN, CRTS, and ZTF, along with 14 years of infrared data in the $W$1 ($\sim$ 3.4 $\mu$m) and $W$2 ($\sim$ 4.6 $\mu$m) bands obtained from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The estimated dust torus size ranges from 1000 to 3000 days, using both the cross-correlation analysis and lightcurve modeling through `MICA'. The measured lag has been corrected by $(1+z)^{-0.37}$, to account for cosmological time dilation and the torus temperature-gradient scaling. We conduct a linear regression analysis for both the $W$1 and $W$2 bands to examine the radius--luminosity ($R$--$L_{BOL}$) relationship under two conditions: one where the slope is fixed at 0.5 and one where it is allowed to vary. For the fixed slope of 0.5, we find the ratio of R$_{\mathrm{BLR}}$: R$_{W1}$: R$_{W2}$ to be 1: 9: 12, indicating that the torus lies outside the BLR and that its size increases with wavelength. Furthermore, we determine the relationship between torus size and L$_{BOL}$, yielding best-fit slopes of $0.413\pm0.047$ for the $W$1 band and $0.397\pm0.058$ for the $W$2 band. Both slopes are shallower than predicted by the dust radiation equilibrium model. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the torus size systematically decreases as the Eddington ratio increases, a trend that can be explained by the self-shadowing effects of slim disks.

 - **Abstract**
 Galaxy observations suggest there is about one merger of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) throughout the observable universe in a year. Here, we introduce the methodology to search for gravitational waves from these events with Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Modelling the inspiral, the merger, the ringdown, and the gravitational wave memory components of the signal in simulated data, we demonstrate a proof of principle for detection and parameter estimation. We study a few representative SMBHB mergers with chirp masses spanning $10^{8} - 10^{10}~M_\odot$ at distances from a few Mpc to 100~Mpc to asses their detectability in PTA observations. Assuming the fixed binary inclination angle of $90^{\circ}$ corresponding to the maximum displacement memory signal, these signals appear distinct for a PTA with 25 pulsars timed for 13 years with 100 ns precision. We demonstrate the capabilities of PTAs to constrain chirp masses and distances of detected merging binaries, as well as to place limits. The sky position uncertainties of the order of $1^{\circ}$, which we find in this optimistic example, could potentially enable electromagnetic follow-up and multi-messenger observations of SMBHB mergers. Finally, we show that the measurement uncertainties on the parameters of simulated merging binaries depend weakly on the presence of the gravitational wave background with Hellings-Downs correlations in our simulated data.

 - **Abstract**
 These notes review theoretical models of massive black hole formation, growth and observables. They start with a brief summary of basic properties of massive black hole properties. The current view on massive black holes and active galactic nuclei at high redshift is then summarized, highlighting the JWST ``revolution'' and the questions raised by the recent observations. The notes then touch on massive black hole formation and growth mechanisms, emphasizing the processes at play at early cosmic times. Then techniques for modeling the cosmic massive black hole evolution, are reviewed with an emphasis on cosmological simulations, before approaching how observables are derived from models. They conclude with a section reflecting on the main questions on the JWST-discovered population in light of the material presented in the earlier sections.

#### Multiwavelength continuum, emission line and BAL variability with prominent PV absorption in the X-ray-weakest quasar PG0043+039

 - **Abstract**
 PG0043+039 has been identified as an extremely X-ray-weak quasar and as a peculiar broad-absorption-line quasar based on UV HST spectra. We took simultaneous deep X-ray observations of PG0043+039 with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, UV spectra with the HST, and optical spectra with the HET telescope in 2022. PG0043+039 was an extreme low-X-ray-luminosity quasar in 2022. This AGN showed an extreme steep alpha_oX value of -2.47. The X-ray luminosity was a factor of 3.4 higher in the meantime in 2013. The optical and UV continuum only decreased by a factor of 1.3 - 1.5 from 2013 to 2022. Very strong emission-line intensity variations by factors of eight or more were observed in the OVI_1038 and SiIV_1403 lines between 2013 and 2022. The other UV emission lines such as Ly_alpha only decreased by a factor of 1.4. We derived a black hole mass of M=6.95*10^{8} M_solar (based on H_beta). This corresponds to an Eddington ratio of L/L_edd = 0.115. PG0043+039 exhibits strong and broad absorption lines in the UV. The highly ionized absorption lines show the largest velocity blueshifts in their broad absorption lines. The PV absorption is very strong, with equivalent widths of 7 - 10 AA. PG0043+039 shows strong Ly_alpha emission despite strong PV absorption. All the strong absorption-line troughs in the UV varied in unison in velocity space back and forward (-2000.+-this http URL-1, +2740.+-this http URL-1) without any major changes in absorption strength or in their profiles for the years 1991, 2013, and 2022. We found no general correlations of X-ray/opt/UV continuum variations with the broad absorption line variations. However, based on the simultaneous UV and X-ray observations - taken in 2013 and 2022 - we see higher maximum velocities of the blueshifted broad absorption lines in the UV when the X-ray flux was lower.

 - **Abstract**
 The infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) into the Milky Way (MW) has displaced the MW's centre of mass, manifesting as an observed reflex motion in the velocities of outer halo stars. We use a Simulation Based Inference framework to constrain properties of the MW, LMC and the induced reflex motion using the dynamics of outer MW halo stars. Specifically, we use the mean radial and tangential velocities of outer halo stars calculated in a set of distance and on-sky bins. We train neural networks to estimate parameter posterior distributions using a set of $128,000$ rigid MW--LMC simulations conditioned upon velocity data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the combined H3+SEGUE+MagE outer halo surveys. We constrain the reflex motion velocity and the enclosed MW and LMC masses within $50 \, \rm kpc$ using the DESI or H3+SEGUE+MagE dataset while varying the survey sky coverage and depth. We find the most precise constraints by using the radial and tangential velocity data from the H3+SEGUE+MagE survey and on-sky quadrant sky coverages. We report a reflex motion velocity, the speed at which the MW lurches towards the LMC, of $v_{\rm{travel}} = 26.4^{+5.5}_{-4.4} \, \rm km \, \rm s^{-1}$, while simultaneously finding an enclosed LMC mass of $M_{\rm LMC}(< 50 \, \rm kpc) = 9.2^{+1.9}_{-2.3} \times 10^{10}\, \rm M_{\odot}$ and enclosed MW mass of $M_{\rm MW}(< 50 \, \rm kpc) = 4.4^{+0.7}_{-0.7} \times 10^{11}\, \rm M_{\odot}$. Our results suggest that the LMC's total mass is at least $\approx 10-15 \%$ of that of the MW. This inference framework is flexible such that it can provide rapid and reliable constraints when applied to any future survey measuring the velocities of outer halo stars.

 - **Abstract**
 When debris from a star that experienced a tidal disruption events (TDE) after passing too close to a massive black hole returns to pericenter on the second passage, it is compressed, leading to the formation of nozzle shocks (in the orbital plane) and pancake shocks (perpendicular to the orbital plane). Resolving these shocks is a long-standing problem in the hydrodynamic simulations of parabolic TDEs. Excessive numerical energy dissipation or heating unrealistically expands the stream. In this Letter, we apply adaptive particle refinement to our 3D general relativistic smoothed particle simulations to locally increase the resolution near the pericenter. We achieve resolutions equivalent to $6.55\times10^{11}$ particles, allowing us to converge on the true energy dissipation. We conclude that only $4\times10^{-5}$ of the orbital energy is dissipated in nozzle shocks for a Sun-like star tidally disrupted by a $10^6$ solar-mass black hole, therefore the nozzle shocks are unlikely to be important in the evolution of TDEs.

#### New charged dynamical particles in spatially flat FLRW space-times

 - **Abstract**
 New time-dependent metric tensors with spherical symmetry satisfying the Einstein-Maxwell equations in space-times with FLRW asymptotic behaviour are derived here for the first time. These geometries describe dynamical charged non-rotating black holes hosted by the perfect fluid of the asymptotic FLRW space-times. Their gravitational sources are the stress-energy tensors formed by a contribution of the perfect fluid and an electromagnetic one due to the Coulomb field produced by the time-dependent black-hole charge in the asymptotic FLRW background. The dynamics of these models is determined by the dynamical mass, which may be an arbitrary function of time, and two arbitrary real-valued parameters. The first one simulates the effect of a cosmological constant as in our $\kappa$-models we proposed recently [I. I. Cotaescu, Eur. Phys. J. C (2024) 84:819]. The second parameter relates surprisingly the dynamical black hole charge to the cubic root of the mass function. The role of these parameters is investigated analyzing simple examples of dynamical charged black holes in the matter-dominated universe.

 - **Abstract**
 We model the motion of a small compact object on a nearly circular orbit around a spinning supermassive black hole, which is also interacting with a thin equatorial accretion-disk surrounding the latter, through tools from self-force and Hamiltonian perturbation theory. We provide an analytical and relativistically-accurate formalism to calculate the rate of energy and angular momentum exchanged at Lindblad resonances. We show that strong relativistic effects can potentially cause a reversal in the direction of the torque on the small compact object if the surface density gradient is not too large. We analytically explore the dependence of the torque reversal location on the spin of the supermassive black hole and demonstrate that the ratio of the reversal location to the innermost stable circular orbit is approximately insensitive to the spin of the supermassive black hole. Our results show that relativistic torques can be 1--2 order of magnitude larger than the Newtonian torque routinely used in the literature to model disk/small-compact-object interactions close to the supermassive black hole. Our results highlight the importance of including relativistic effects when modeling environmental effects in extreme mass-ratio inspirals.

 - **Abstract**
 Within general relativity, we study spherically symmetric configurations with wormhole topology consisting of spinor fields and a Maxwell electric field. For such a system, we construct complete families of regular asymmetric solutions describing wormholes connecting two identical Minkowski spacetimes. The physical properties of such systems are completely determined by the values of three input quantities: the throat parameter, the spinor frequency, and the coupling constant. Depending on the specific values of these parameters, the configurations may have essentially different characteristics, including negative ADM masses.

 - **Abstract**
 This work tries to establish the theoretical framework for gravitomagnetic-hydrodynamics (GMHD), revealing a fundamental correspondence between geometrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamic phenomena in general relativity. By introducing the gravitoelectromagnetic formalism to relativistic fluids, a set of leading-order GMHD equations is derived that govern the co-evolution of spacetime geometry and matter dynamics in the early Universe. This analysis reveals that, under high-temperature and high-density conditions such as those during the electroweak phase transition, the gravitomagnetic Reynolds number becomes large, leading to a strongly coupled fluid-spacetime system. This coupling supports the emergence of gravitational Alfven waves and a turbulent energy cascade. Our findings suggest that GMHD turbulence may leave imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background, offering a new window into the nonlinear dynamics of the primordial Universe.

 - **Abstract**
 This study delves into the intricate properties of a Schwarzschild black hole enveloped by King dark matter in an isotropic configuration. The thermodynamic characteristics of this black hole are meticulously analyzed, and the dynamics of massive and massless particles in its vicinity are investigated. In examining the trajectories of massless particles, the shadow cast in the presence of King dark matter is explored, revealing virtual ranges for the corresponding parameters. For the dynamics of massive particles, the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit, angular momentum, energy, and angular velocity of a test particle within the King dark matter framework surrounding the black hole are calculated. The effect of King dark matter on the accretion disk energy flux, effective radiation temperature, differential luminosity, and spectral luminosity are then investigated. The stability of the photon sphere in the presence of King dark matter is also studied, and finally, the thermodynamic potentials of this black hole are examined from a topological perspective.

 - **Abstract**
 We use a Hamiltonian version of the semiclassical Einstein equation to study classical gravity coupled to a quantum scalar field with potential in spherical symmetry. The system is defined by effective constraints where the matter terms are replaced by their expectation values in a quantum state. For the static case, we find numerically that the resulting equations admit asymptotically flat, de Sitter, and anti-de Sitter boson star and regular black hole solutions. We also show that the Bardeen and Hayward nonsingular black hole proposals (and some generalizations thereof) are not solutions to our equations.

 - **Abstract**
 We carefully investigate, extend, and shed new light on the McVittie exact solution of Einstein's gravity (EG) with the focus on the implications in the Universe we live in. It turns out that the only known exact solution of EG, which interpolates between an asymptotic homogeneous and isotropic Universe and a Schwarzschild black hole, is actually singular in 2M, namely, the curvature invariants diverge and the spacetime is geodetically incomplete in 2M. Very important: all energy conditions are satisfied except the dominant one (DEC), which is violated inside the radius 8M/3. Notice that 2M is not the event horizon, but a curvature singularity covered by an apparent horizon that, at the actual stage of the Universe, nearly coincides with 2M. Moreover, the curvature singularity is not analytic with respect to the dynamics of the Universe encoded in the Hubble function $H(t)$: for arbitrarily small but not zero $H^\prime(t)$, the curvature invariants are singular, while for $H^\prime(t)$ identically zero, they are regular. Therefore, we can not analytically decouple the black hole from the entire Cosmos, namely, we can not assume the Schwarzschild solution locally and the FRW metric at large scale without violating the analyticity of the metric. Since the spacetime does not exist for $r \leqslant$2M, and since the DEC is violated for r<8M/3, we are allowed to doubt the existence of black holes in our Universe as understood up to now. In particular, the violation of DEC seems catastrophic for the spacetime stability below 8M/3. We build and study a toy model for the gravitational collapse, generalizing the Vaidya to the McVittie-Vaidya metric. Although dynamical, the singularities remain in the same locations. Finally, in order to achieve the curvature smoothness and geodesic completion, we propose two solutions: one in Einstein's conformal gravity, and the other replacing M with M(r).

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the modified thermodynamics of a Hayward-Anti de Sitter (H-AdS) black hole in atypical conditions, incorporating a string fluid, Hayward regularisation, and quantum entropy corrections. Our analysis reveals a first-order phase transition between small and large black hole phases, characterised by a swallowtail behaviour in the Gibbs free energy profiles. It is found that the key parameters - string fluid strength, Hayward regularisation scale, and quantum correction coefficients significantly influence the critical temperature and phase stability of the H-AdS system. It is further noticed that a large black hole phase is stabilised by these modifications, with quantum corrections smoothing the transition. This model offers a valuable framework to study quantum gravity effects on black hole thermodynamics with potential implications in analysing black hole evolution and astrophysical observations.

 - **Abstract**
 This paper investigates the bounds on the minimum orbital period for test objects around d-dimensional charged black holes in asymptotically flat spacetimes. We find numerically that the minimum orbital period decreases as the charge of the black hole increases. Thus, the upper limit is reached for an uncharged black hole, while the lower limit is attained for a maximally charged one. We then analytically derive the upper and lower bounds for the minimum orbital period. These results improve our understanding of dynamics around d-dimensional black holes and impose constraints on candidate gravity theories.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate quasi-universal relations in neutron stars linking standard observables, such as tidal deformability ($\Lambda$) and normalized moment of inertia ($\bar{I}$), with normalized curvature scalars in general relativity. These curvature scalars include the Ricci scalar ($\mathcal{R}$), the Ricci tensor contraction ($\mathcal{J}$), the Weyl scalar ($\mathcal{W}$), and the Kretschmann scalar ($\mathcal{K}$). We systematically examine both piecewise polytropic and color-flavor-locked equations of state, finding: (1) significant correlations between both local (central and surface) and global (volume-averaged) curvature scalars with $\bar{I}$ and $\Lambda$; (2) especially strong correlations between surface and volume-averaged curvature scalars and both $\bar{I}$ and $\Lambda$; (3) a near equation-of-state-independent maximum for the normalized Ricci scalar, suggesting a link to the trace anomaly; and (4) new universal relations involving normalized central and volume-averaged pressure and energy density, which also correlate strongly with $\bar{I}$ and $\Lambda$. Using constraints from GW170817 and low-mass X-ray binaries, we demonstrate that $\Lambda$ measurements directly constrain both scalar curvature quantities and the interior properties of canonical-mass neutron stars. These findings agree with the literature on equation-of-state-dependent Bayesian inference estimates. Our identified relations thus provide an equation-of-state-insensitive connection between stellar observables, spacetime geometry, and the microphysics of compact stars.

 - **Abstract**
 While the majority of gravitational wave (GW) events observed by the LIGO and Virgo detectors are consistent with mergers of binary black holes (BBHs) on quasi-circular orbits, some events are also consistent with non-zero orbital eccentricity, indicating that the binaries could have formed via dynamical interactions. Moreover, there may be GW events which show support for spin-precession, eccentricity, or both. In this work, we study the interplay of spins and eccentricity on the parameter estimation of GW signals from BBH mergers. We inject eccentric signals with no spins, aligned spins, and precessing spins using hybrids, TEOBResumS-DALI, and new Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations, respectively, and study the biases in the posteriors of source parameters when these signals are recovered with a quasi-circular precessing-spin waveform model, as opposed to an aligned-spin eccentric waveform model. We find significant biases in the source parameters, such as chirp mass and spin-precession ($\chi_p$), when signals from highly-eccentric BBHs are recovered with a quasi-circular waveform model. Moreover, we find that for signals with both eccentricity and spin-precession effects, Bayes factor calculations confirm that an eccentric, aligned-spin model is preferred over a quasi-circular precessing-spin model. Our study highlights the complex nature of GW signals from eccentric, precessing-spin binaries and the need for readily usable inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric, spin-precessing waveform models for unbiased parameter estimation.

 - **Abstract**
 Einstein-bumblebee gravity is one of the simplest vector-tensor theories that realizes spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. In this work, we first construct an exact dyonic Reissner-Nordström-like black hole solution in four dimensions, carrying both electric and magnetic charges and admitting general topological horizons. We then study its thermodynamic properties, and employ the Wald formalism to compute the conserved mass and entropy, thereby establishing the first law of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we generalize these results to Taub-Newman-Unti-Tamburino case and higher dimensions case.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational wave astronomy has opened an unprecedented window onto tests of gravity and fundamental physics in the strong-field regime. In this study, we examine a series of well-motivated deviations from the classical Kerr solution of General Relativity and employ gravitational wave data to place constraints on possible deviations from the Kerr geometry. The method involves calculating the phase of gravitational waves using the effective one-body formalism and then applying the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework to constrain the parameters appearing in these scenarios beyond General Relativity. The effective one-body method, known for its capability to model complex gravitational waveforms, is used to compute the wave phase, and the post-Einsteinian framework allows for a flexible, model-independent approach to parameter estimation. We demonstrate that gravitational wave data provide evidence supporting the Kerr nature of black holes, showing no significant deviations from General Relativity, thereby affirming its validity within the current observational limits. This work bridges theoretical waveform modeling with observational constraints, providing a pathway to test the no-hair theorem and probe the astrophysical viability of modified black holes.

 - **Abstract**
 Gravitational waves from black hole binary mergers carry information about the component spins, but inference is sensitive to analysis assumptions, which may be broken by terrestrial noise transients known as glitches. Using a variety of simulated glitches and gravitational wave signals, we study the conditions under which glitches can bias spin measurements. We confirm the theoretical expectation that inference and subtraction of glitches invariably leaves behind residual power due to statistical uncertainty, no matter the strength (signal-to-noise ratio; SNR) of the original glitch. Next we show that low-SNR glitches - including those below the threshold for flagging data-quality issues - can still significantly bias spin inference. Such biases occur for a range of glitch morphologies, even in cases where glitches and signals are not precisely aligned in phase. Furthermore, we find that residuals of glitch subtraction can result in biases as well. Our results suggest that joint inference of the glitch and gravitational wave parameters, with appropriate models and priors, is required to address these uncertainties inherent in glitch mitigation via subtraction.

 - **Abstract**
 We provide a holographic prescription to compute real-time thermal correlators with arbitrary operator ordering. In field theory, these correlation functions are captured by a multi-fold Schwinger-Keldysh time contour. We propose a holographic dual for these contours, which generalizes the gravitational Schwinger-Keldysh geometry previously advocated in the literature. Our geometry consists of multiple AdS-black holes glued together at the future and past horizons, with matching conditions determined by unitarity and the KMS condition. As a proof of concept, we solve for a probe scalar field in this geometry and compute bulk-bulk and bulk-boundary propagators, in terms of which we evaluate the 4-point functions at tree-level. We show that in perturbation theory, the lowest-order diagrams that contribute non-trivially to the out-of-time order four-point function are exchange diagrams which explore the full four-fold geometry. Furthermore, these diagrams reduce to a simple factorized expression. We propose a conjecture on the structure of higher order observables and provide a partial proof by studying a subset of the contributing diagrams.

 - **Abstract**
 Recent studies have demonstrated that an $\textit{ad hoc}$ Dirichlet boundary condition, placed outside but close to an event horizon, for probe degrees of freedom in an otherwise black hole geometry is capable of capturing non-trivial level-correlations of the corresponding spectrum of the probe sector. Much of the interesting physics stems from a hierarchy of scales that is present in the quantum spectrum, in terms of two quantum numbers that characterize it. In this work, we establish an explicit connection with the hierarchy of these scales with a $\textit{radial localization}$ or the absence of it of the probe scalar WKB-wavefunction. Subsequently, this scale separation can be traced back to the hierarchy between the local red-shift and the classical light-traversing time in a geometry that produces a Rindler-throat. The classical null ray takes a logarithmically divergent time to reach the Dirichlet wall, and interestingly, we explicitly demonstrate that the scalar quantum spectrum arising from the Rindler throat yields a Dip-time of the corresponding spectral form factor, which scales with a universal power of the light traversing time. Armed with these, we further consider a $\textit{dressed effective model}$ where the Dirichlet boundary condition is inserted in a ten-dimensional supergravity geometry, where classical string sources back-react. We demonstrate that, as a result of this backreaction, the quantum-dynamical time-scales, $\textit{e.g.}$ the Dip time of the corresponding spectral form factor can be further enhanced with factors of the string length, thereby making the Dirichlet wall configuration better mimic the true black hole. In the dual field theory, the geometry corresponds to thermal states of a large $N$ gauge theory in the Veneziano limit, where both the number of colour and the flavour degrees of freedom are large.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the dilaton fluctuations near the string based on three classes of solutions of the 3D C-metric within the framework of the string-world holography. As a setup of holography, we focus on the asymptotic symmetry, recover the Virasoro algebra by central extension and get the central charge of the AdS3. Then we reduce the gravity on the brane as a JT gravity model by introducing a fluctuation. As an extension of the braneworld, we also investigate the higher curvature correction to the brane under some conditions. Finally, we make an expansion on generalized entropy of black hole solution with respect to small l and find that the leading term comes from Weyl anomaly, which is different from that in 4-dimensional C-metric.

 - **Abstract**
 Sphalerons in nonlinear Klein-Gordon models are unstable lump-like solutions that arise from a saddle point between true and false vacua in the energy functional. Numerical simulations are presented which show the sphaleron evolving into an accelerating kink-antikink pair whose separation approaches the speed of light asymptotically at large times. Utilizing a nonlinear collective coordinate method, an approximate analytical solution is derived for this evolution. These results indicate that an exact solution is expected to exhibit a gradient blow-up for large times,caused by energy concentrating at the flanks of the kink-antikink pair.

 - **Abstract**
 We propose to work on the Euclidean black hole solution with a corner rather than with the prevalent conical singularity. As a result, we find that the Wald formula for black hole entropy can be readily obtained for generic F(Rabcd) gravity by using both the action without the corner term and the action with the corner term due to their equivalence to the first order variation, which implies that it is the corner rather than the corner term that encodes the entropy related information. With such an equivalence, we further make use of a special diffeomorphism to accomplish a direct derivation of the ADM Hamiltonian conjugate to the Killing vector field normal to the horizon in the Lorentz signature as a conjugate variable of the inverse temperature in the grand canonical ensemble.
