 - **Abstract**
 We present measurements of the temperature and E-mode polarization angular power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from observations of 4% of the sky with SPT-3G, the current camera on the South Pole Telescope (SPT). The maps used in this analysis are the deepest used in a CMB TT/TE/EE analysis to date. The maps and resulting power spectra have been validated through blind and unblind tests. The measurements of the lensed EE and TE spectra are the most precise to date at l=1800-4000 and l=2200-4000, respectively. Combining our TT/TE/EE spectra with previously published SPT-3G CMB lensing results, we find parameters for the standard LCDM model consistent with Planck and ACT-DR6 with comparable constraining power. We report a Hubble constant of $H_0=66.66\pm0.60$ km/s/Mpc from SPT-3G alone, 6.2 sigma away from local measurements from SH0ES. For the first time, combined ground-based (SPT+ACT) CMB primary and lensing data have reached Planck's constraining power on some parameters, a milestone for CMB cosmology. The combination of these three CMB experiments yields the tightest CMB constraints to date, with $H_0=67.24\pm0.35$ km/s/Mpc, and the amplitude of clustering $\sigma_8=0.8137\pm0.0038$. CMB data alone show no evidence for physics beyond LCDM; however, we observe a 2.8 sigma difference in LCDM between CMB and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) results from DESI-DR2, which is relaxed in extended models. The combination of CMB and BAO yields 2-3 sigma shifts from LCDM in the curvature of the universe, the amplitude of CMB lensing, or the dark energy equation of state. It also drives mild preferences for models that address the Hubble tension through modified recombination or variations in the electron mass in a non-flat universe. This work highlights the growing power of ground-based CMB experiments and lays a foundation for further cosmological analyses with SPT-3G.

 - **Abstract**
 We present projected constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a constituent of dark matter, based on microlensing observations from the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We use a catalogue of microlensing light curves simulated with Rubin Observatory's OpSims to demonstrate that competitive constraints crucially rely on minimising the false positive rate (FPR) of the classification algorithm. We propose the Bayesian information criterion and a Boosted Decision Tree as effective discriminators and compare their derived efficiency and FPR to a more standard $\chi^2$-test.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar-mass black holes (BHs) represent the natural end states of massive stars. It is estimated that $10^8$ stellar-mass BHs are present in the Milky Way galaxy, a significant fraction of which are expected to be isolated. Despite their expected abundance, only about 20 have been detected so far - mostly in binary systems - with just one confirmed isolated black hole (IsoBH) identified via astrometric microlensing. In this study, we investigate the potential for detecting electromagnetic emissions from IsoBHs by generating synthetic model spectra of their emissions in different types of interstellar medium environments. These model spectra are then compared with current observational capabilities. We show that photons emitted by IsoBHs - especially those accreting material in dense environments or within the Solar neighborhood - should be readily detectable. However, confidently identifying these sources remains highly challenging. We conclude that a number of IsoBHs must already exist in current astronomical catalogs but have not been identified as such. We outline possible strategies for detection and identification of IsoBHs using the current and upcoming telescopes.

 - **Abstract**
 Primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses below $10^9\,\rm{g}$ are typically assumed to have negligible cosmological impact due to their rapid evaporation via Hawking radiation. However, the 'memory burden' effect, which is a quantum suppression of PBH evaporation, can dramatically alter their decay dynamics. In this work, we revisit early-Universe constraints on ultralight PBHs in this mass range, demonstrating that memory burden significantly alters previous constraints. We compute new cosmological bounds from BBN that strongly limit the presence of ultralight PBHs in the early Universe. We report that the PBHs in the mass range $10^0$-$10^2\,\rm{g}$ for $k=2$ are unconstrained by observations.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the orbital decay of a massive BH embedded in a dark matter halo and a stellar bulge, using both analytical and numerical simulations with the aim of developing and validating a reliable dynamical friction (DF) correction across simulation resolutions. We develop a Python-based library to solve the equations of motion of the BH and provide an analytical framework for the numerical results. Then, we carry out simulations at different resolutions and for different softening choices using the Tree-PM code OpenGADGET3, where we implement an improved DF correction based on a kernel-weighted local density estimation. Our results demonstrate that the DF correction significantly accelerates BH sinking and ensures convergence with increasing resolution, closely matching analytical predictions. We find that in low-resolution regimes - particularly when the BH mass is smaller than that of the background particles - our DF model still effectively controls BH dynamics. Contrary to expectations, the inclusion of a stellar bulge can delay sinking due to numerical heating, an effect partially mitigated by the DF correction. We conclude that our refined DF implementation provides a robust framework for modeling BH dynamics both in controlled simulation setups of galaxies and in large-scale cosmological simulations. This will be crucial for future simulation campaigns, to enable more accurate predictions of AGN accretion and feedback, and to estimate gravitational-wave event rates.
#### A Black Hole is Born: 3D GRMHD Simulation of Black Hole Formation from Core-Collapse

 - **Abstract**
 We present the first three-dimensional, fully general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (3D GRMHD) simulation of a black hole (BH) formed from the collapsed core of a massive star. The ability to self-consistently capture the birth of a compact remnant in 3D is crucial for modeling natal BH properties (including masses, spins, and kicks), which are of particular interest in the era of gravitational wave astronomy. However, such simulations have remained elusive due to extreme computational challenges and demands. We employ the GPU-accelerated dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code GRaM-X to follow the collapse, core-bounce, shock propagation, and eventual BH formation of a massive stellar progenitor in full 3D. We initialize our simulation by mapping a one-dimensional (1D) model of a star with a zero-age-main-sequence mass of $45 M_\odot$ to 3D. We use moderate rotation (consistent with expectations from stellar evolution modeling) and a relatively weak dipolar magnetic field. The collapsing core drives a shock that reaches a maximum radius of roughly 170 km before stalling and does not lead to a successful explosion. The proto-neutron star accretes matter before collapsing to form a BH $t_{BH} \approx 325$ ms after core-bounce. The time of BH formation and initial BH mass are remarkably similar to those obtained with GR1D, a 1D general-relativistic neutrino-hydrodynamics code, to which we compare our results. We track the horizon of the newborn BH after formation and calculate a steady kick velocity of $v_{kick} \approx 72$ km/s and a mass of $M_{BH} \approx 2.62 M_\odot$, which is still rising at the end of the simulation.

 - **Abstract**
 As an alternative gravitational theory to General Relativity (GR), Conformal Gravity (CG) can be verified through astronomical observations. Currently, Mannheim and Kazanas have provided vacuum solutions for cosmological and local gravitational systems, and these solutions may resolve the dark matter and dark energy issues encountered in GR, making them particularly valuable. For static, spherically symmetric systems, CG predicts an additional linear potential generated by luminous matter in addition to the conventional Newtonian potential. This extra potential is expected to account for the observations of galaxies and galaxy clusters without the need of dark matter. It is characterized by the parameter $\gamma^*$, which corresponds to the linear potential generated by the unit of the solar mass, and it is thus a universal constant. The value of $\gamma^\ast$ was determined by fitting the rotation curve data of spiral galaxies. These predictions of CG should also be verified by the observations of strong gravitational lensing. In this study, building upon the previous research, we tested CG via strong lensing statistics. We used a well-defined sample that consisted of both galaxies and galaxy clusters. This allowed us to test CG through statistical strong lensing in a way similar to the conventional approach in GR. As anticipated, our results were consistent with previous studies, namely that the fitted $\gamma^*$ is much larger than that from rotation curves. Intriguingly, we further discovered that, in order to fit the strong lensing data of another sample, the value of $\gamma^*$ cannot be a constant, as is required in CG. Instead, we derived a formula for $\gamma^*$ as a function of the stellar mass $M_*$ of the galaxies or galaxy clusters. It was found that $\gamma^*$ decreases as $M_*$ increases.
#### Temporal evolution of quasi-periodic oscillations in an accreting black hole Swift J1727.8-1613: coevolution of the disk-corona during the state transition

 - **Abstract**
 Low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are commonly observed in black hole X-ray binaries, and their frequency has been found to correlate with various energy spectral properties. In this work, we present a detailed timing analysis of Swift J1727.8-1613, revealing a novel two-branch correlation between the QPO frequency and the observed disk emission, which differs from previous findings of a single correlation. Specifically, at QPO frequencies below 3 Hz, the QPO frequency is negatively correlated with the observed disk emission. Such a negative relation transitions to a positive one, as the QPO frequency exceeds approximately 3 Hz. The correlation between QPO frequency and Compton flux exhibits an opposite trend, with a positive correlation at lower frequencies and a negative correlation at higher ones. We interpret these behaviors as signatures of an evolving disk-corona geometry, within the framework of a Lense-Thirring precessing hot flow. Additionally, we find that during the flare state, the QPO fractional root-mean-square (rms) remains nearly constant above 15 keV, but increases with energy below this threshold. The slope of the rms-energy relation becomes steeper as the energy spectrum softens.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we study two scalar field driven dark energy models characterized by the axion potential and the inverse power law potential, each coupled to dark matter through a momentum exchange interaction. By formulating the dynamics as an autonomous system, we identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. To constrain these models, we utilize observational data from Pantheon Plus Type Ia Supernovae, DES Y5, DESI DR2 BAO, and Planck 2018 CMB compressed likelihood, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Both potentials exhibit weak to strong preference over the $\Lambda$CDM model, with a particularly strong preference for the momentum-coupled scenario when Supernova data are included in the analysis. Furthermore, we find the coupling parameter to be negative, with no lower bound, for both potentials. This suggests that momentum-exchange coupling between the dark sectors cannot be ruled out. From the stability analysis, we observe that for both potentials, the late-time attractor corresponds to a dark energy dominated phase, and the scalar field can behave as a stiff fluid during the early epoch.
#### An H$α$ Cloud in the HI Tail: Recent Star Formation in the Outskirts of NGC 4258 Revealed by Nanshan 1-m Telescope

 - **Abstract**
 We present first-light deep H$\alpha$ imaging taken with the Nanshan 1-meter wide-field telescope on the local galaxy NGC 4258, alongside archival data from Hubble Space telescope (HST), Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, and The Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. The H$\alpha$ image shows ongoing star formation not only inside the galaxy but also in an HI cloud in the eastern HI tail, which is roughly 16 kpc away from the main galaxy. The HST images reveal several ultra-blue compact objects ($\rm F555W - F814W <-0.5 mag,\, FWHM\sim 0.2''$) in the H$\alpha$ bright region, aligned with the HI tail, suggesting the presence of young open cluster candidate in the HI tail. Our results suggest that wide field H$\alpha$ imaging is a valuable tool for investigating recent star formation in the extended regions of NGC 4258. Furthermore, the star formation in diffuse HI tails could highlight an potential aspect of galaxy stellar halo formation, warranting further investigation of the impact of star formation in halos on galaxy evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Stellar streams are sensitive laboratories for understanding the small-scale structure in our Galaxy's gravitational field. Here, we analyze the morphology of the $300S$ stellar stream, which has an eccentric, retrograde orbit and thus could be an especially powerful probe of both baryonic and dark substructures within the Milky Way. Due to extensive background contamination from the Sagittarius stream (Sgr), we perform an analysis combining Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey photometry, $\textit{Gaia}$ DR3 proper motions, and spectroscopy from the Southern Stellar Stream Spectroscopic Survey ($\textit{S}^5$). We redetermine the stream coordinate system and distance gradient, then apply two approaches to describe $300S$'s morphology. In the first, we analyze stars from $\textit{Gaia}$ using proper motions to remove Sgr. In the second, we generate a simultaneous model of $300S$ and Sgr based purely on photometric information. Both approaches agree within their respective domains and describe the stream over a region spanning $33^\circ$. Overall, $300S$ has three well-defined density peaks and smooth variations in stream width. Furthermore, $300S$ has a possible gap of $\sim 4.7^\circ$ and a kink. Dynamical modeling of the kink implies that $300S$ was dramatically influenced by the Large Magellanic Cloud. This is the first model of $300S$'s morphology across its entire known footprint, opening the door for deeper analysis to constrain the structures of the Milky Way.

 - **Abstract**
 Chemically-homogeneously evolving stars have been proposed to account for several exotic phenomena, including gravitational-wave emissions and gamma-ray bursts. Here we study whether these stars can explain the metal-poor dwarf galaxy, I Zwicky 18. We apply our synthetic spectral models from Paper II to (i) establish a classification sequence for these hot stars, (ii) predict the photonionizing flux and the strength of emission lines from a IZw18-like stellar population, and (iii) compare our predictions to available observations of this galaxy. Adding two new models computed with PoWR, we report (i) these stars to follow a unique sequence of classes: O->WN->WO (i.e. without ever being WC). From our population synthesis with standard assumptions, we predict that (ii) the source of the UV C-IV and other emission bumps is a couple dozen WO-type Wolf-Rayet stars (not WC as previously assumed) which are the result of chem.-hom. evolution, while these, combined with the rest of the O-star population, account for the He-II ionizing flux and spectral hardness. Contrasting our results against published optical and UV data and accounting for different aperture sizes and spatial regions probed by the observations, we find that (iii) our models are highly consistent with them. Since our "massive Pop II stars" might just as well exist in early star-forming regions, our findings have implications for upcoming JWST surveys; and given that our results apply for binary populations too as long as the same fraction (10%) of the systems evolves chem. homogeneously, we conclude that the stellar progenitors of gravitational waves may very well exist today in IZw18.

 - **Abstract**
 Currently, the increasing availability of accurate cosmological probes leads to the emergence of tensions between data on the one hand and between theoretical predictions and direct observations on the other. Moreover, after 25 years since the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe has elected the $\Lambda$CDM model as the reference model, resolving shortcomings of the standard cosmological model seems to be an unpostponed priority. Hence, it is key to test alternative models and investigate new cosmological probes at distances that range from the late to the early Universe, namely between the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae and baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) data. Bargiacchi et al. (2022) for the first time analysed dark energy (DE) models using quasars (QSOs) while also testing their consistency with BAO. Here, we carry on by exploring the compatibility of QSOs with both CMB data and dark energy survey measurements against the standard cosmological model and some DE extensions, such as the $w$CDM and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterisations. We also consider an interacting dark matter and vacuum energy scenario, where vacuum energy perturbations affect the evolution of the matter growth rate in a decomposed Chaplygin gas model. We implement the QSO probe in Cobaya Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, using Botzmann solver codes as Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS) for the theory predictions. Our work shows that simple DE deviations from $\Lambda$CDM model do not reconcile the data and that only more complex models of interaction in the dark sector can succeed in solving the discrepancies of probes at all scales.

 - **Abstract**
 Future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are expected to detect tens of thousands of compact binary coalescences (CBC) per year, depending also on the final detectors layout. For this reason, it is essential to have a fast, reliable tool for forecasting how different detector layouts will affect parameter estimation for these events. The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) is a common tool for tackling this problem. In this paper, we present a new open source code GWJulia to perform FIM analysis of CBC parameters, i.e., stellar black-hole binaries (BBH), neutron star binaries (BNS), and neutron star-black hole binaries (NSBH). The code is purely written in Julia, making it fast while maintaining a high level of accuracy. We consider a set of case studies to compare different Einstein Telescope (ET) designs. We compare a 10km triangular configuration with two 15km L-shaped detectors with different orientations and temperatures. We discuss also the accuracy of combinations of parameters, which is very informative for cosmology or population studies. Finally, we focus on the detection of golden events and explore how the FIM can guide posterior sampling of GW signals using a novel Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler.

 - **Abstract**
 We analyse DESI BAO, CMB, and supernova data to explore the physical origin of the DESI indication for dynamical dark energy. Beyond the standard CPL parametrization, we explore truncated alternatives and quintessence models. We conclude that there is compelling evidence for dark energy to be decaying in the late universe, but the evidence for a phantom behaviour is less significant. Models without phantom behaviour are compatible with the data at the $2\sigma$ CL. Furthermore, we examine a concrete quintessence scenario with a Higgs-like potential, allowing for a direct comparison with parametrized approaches and testing its consistency with current observations. This framework enables a broader investigation of late-time cosmic evolution and reveals a $93.8\%$ preference for a future transition into an anti-de Sitter space, which may ultimately lead to a cosmological collapse of our Universe.
#### Natal kick by early-asymmetrical pairs of jets to the neutron star of supernova remnant S147

 - **Abstract**
 We analyze the bipolar morphology of the jet-shaped core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) S147 and its neutron star (NS) kick velocity, and suggest that two pairs of unequal, opposite jets contributed to the NS kick velocity. This kick by early asymmetrical pairs (kick-BEAP) of jets mechanism operates within the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We examine the prominent pair of large ears and, based on their flat structure rather than the more common conical structure of ears, conclude that two pairs of jets close in angle inflated the two opposite ears. We connect two opposite X-ray bright zones by an additional axis to create the full point-symmetric morphology of CCSNR S147. We propose that the two unequal jets that formed the X-ray bright zones imparted the first kick-BEAP, while the two pairs of jets that formed the ears imparted the second kick-BEAP. The two kick velocities are of about equal magnitude of ~450 km/s, which implies very energetic jets. Such jets can excite gravitational waves that present detectors can detect from the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. We use the morphology we identify to estimate the CCSNR age at 23,000 yr. Our results strengthen the JJEM.

 - **Abstract**
 Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a stellar-mass compact object spiraling into a massive black hole, are key sources for future space-based gravitational wave observatories such as LISA. Accurate modeling of these systems requires incorporating the spin effects of both the primary and secondary bodies, particularly for waveforms at the precision required for LISA detection and astrophysical parameter extraction. In this work, we develop a framework for modeling flux-driven spherical inspirals (orbits of approximately constant Boyer-Lindquist radius) of a spinning secondary into a Kerr black hole. We leverage recently found solutions for the motion of spinning test particles and compute the associated gravitational wave fluxes to linear order in the secondary spin. Next, we show that spherical orbits remain spherical under radiation reaction at linear order in spin, and derive the evolution of the orbital parameters throughout the inspiral. We implement a numerical scheme for waveform generation in the frequency domain and assess the impact of the secondary spin on the gravitational wave signal. In contrast to quasi-circular inspirals, we find that neglecting the secondary spin in spherical inspirals induces large mismatches in the waveforms that will plausibly be detectable by LISA.

 - **Abstract**
 Nonlinear gravitational wave memory is a surprise of theoretical physics. Whereas it is understood that a gravitational wave induces oscillatory squeezing and stretching motion in a collection of freely-falling test masses, it is unexpected that the wave leaves a residual displacement of the test masses. This displacement is the tribute in memoriam to the passing wave. The memory originates in a nonlinear feature of gravitation. Whilst merging black holes are a significant source of gravitational waves, the gravitational wave energy itself is a further source of gravitational waves. The memory is often described as a permanent displacement of the test masses caused by a burst of primary gravitational waves. But as we show, memory vanishes at late times in a sea of echoes.

 - **Abstract**
 We explore the dynamics and gravitational-wave emission from black hole pairs on unbound orbits undergoing close hyperbolic encounters (CHEs) in dense astrophysical environments. While General Relativity predicts gravitational Bremsstrahlung radiation occurring at periastron, the contribution of the scalar gravitational-wave mode in fully general f(R) gravity remains largely unexplored. We characterize the f(R) scalar mode gravitational radiation for both non-precessing and precessing hyperbolic orbits, identifying potential detection signatures for advanced gravitational wave observatories. By systematically varying orbital precession and eccentricity, we examine their influence on the emitted gravitational waves. We derive potentially detectable time delay and scalar-to-tensor amplitude ratio estimates for representative astrophysical environments and determine optimal orbital configurations for the detection of f(R) scalar gravitational waves from hyperbolic encounters. Our results provide a theoretical framework for scalar-mode signals and observables, establishing CHEs as a promising probe of f(R) gravity with future detectors.

 - **Abstract**
 Charged and/or rotating black holes in General Relativity feature Cauchy horizons, which indicate a breakdown of predictability in the theory. Focusing on spherically symmetric charged black holes, we remark that the inevitability of Reissner-Nordstrom Cauchy horizon is due to the divergent electromagnetic self-energy of point charges. We demonstrate that any causal theory of nonlinear electrodynamics that regularizes the point charge self-energy also eliminates Cauchy horizons for weakly charged black holes. These black holes feature one (event) horizon and a spacelike singularity, analogous to the Schwarzschild metric. An example with Born-Infeld electrodynamics illustrates how this gives rise to an upper bound on the charge, which we compare with known bounds.

 - **Abstract**
 An exact solution to the vacuum Einstein equations is presented, whose structure is based on the Hopf fibration. The solution employs a geodesic null vector field that defines a twisting congruence and appears in the metric in Kerr-Schild form. This solution is of Petrov type D and involves two parameters. Remarkably, the resulting spacetime is regular, with no curvature singularities. Both the Kretschmann scalar and the Chern-Pontryagin scalar are nonzero and remain finite throughout the spacetime. In addition, the Newman-Penrose Weyl scalar $\Psi_2$ possesses both nonzero real and imaginary parts, reflecting the topologically nontrivial nature of the gravitational field. The spacetime also admits two Killing vector fields and a Killing-Yano tensor, which induces an associated Killing tensor, revealing its hidden symmetry. The derivation is simple and self-contained, offering a transparent and geometrically guided approach to finding new exact solutions in general relativity.

 We establish a hidden symmetry between the specific volumes of the coexistent phases and hence develop an analytical approach to study criticality of AdS black holes. In particular, using the method, we solve the coexistence line exactly for a variety of black holes, including the charged AdS black hole (in the four and the five dimensions), the rotating AdS black hole, the Gauss-Bonnet black hole and the quantum BTZ black hole.

 - **Abstract**
 In this work, we shall consider how a dynamical oscillating and phantom crossing dark energy era can be realised in the context of $F(R)$ gravity. We approach the topic from a theoretical standpoint, considering all the conditions that may lead to a consistent phantom crossing behaviour and separately how the $F(R)$ gravity context may realise an oscillating dark energy era. Apart from our qualitative considerations, we study quantitatively two $F(R)$ gravity dark energy models, which are viable cosmologically and also exhibit simultaneously phantom crossing behaviour and oscillating dark energy. We consider these models by numerically solving the field equations using appropriate statefinder parameters engineered for dark energy studies. As we show, $F(R)$ provides a natural extension of Einstein's general relativity, which can naturally realise a transition from a phantom era to a quintessential era, a feature supported by recent observational data, without resorting to phantom scalar fields to realise the phantom evolution.

 - **Abstract**
 Transient noise ("glitches") in gravitational wave detectors can mimic or obscure true signals, significantly reducing detection sensitivity. Identifying and excluding glitch-contaminated data segments is therefore crucial for enhancing the performance of gravitational-wave searches. We perform a noise analysis of the KAGRA data obtained during the O3GK observation. Our analysis is performed with hierarchical veto (Hveto) which identifies noises based on the statistical time correlation between the main channel and the auxiliary channels. A total of 2,531 noises were vetoed by 28 auxiliary channels with the configuration (i.e., signal-to-noise threshold set to 8) that we chose for Hveto. We identify vetoed events as glitches on the spectrogram via visual examination after plotting them with Q-transformation. By referring to the Gravity Spy project, we categorize 2,354 glitches into six types: blip, helix, scratchy, and scattered light, which correspond to those listed in Gravity Spy, and dot and line, which are not found in the Gravity Spy classification and are thus named based on their spectrogram morphology in KAGRA data. The remaining 177 glitches are determined not to belong to any of these six types. We show how the KAGRA glitch types are related to each subsystem of KAGRA. To investigate the possible correlation between the main channel and the round winner - an auxiliary channel statistically associated with the main channel for vetoing purposes - we visually examine the similarity or difference in the glitch pattern on the spectrogram. We compare the qualitative correlation found through visual examination with coherence, which is known to provide quantitative measurement for the correlation between the main channel and each auxiliary channel. Our comprehensive noise analysis will help improve the data quality of KAGRA by applying it to future KAGRA observation data.

 - **Abstract**
 We discuss the Generalized Uncertainty Principle and the Extended Uncertainty Principle in the context of black hole solutions coming from non-local theories of gravity, focusing, specifically, on Infinite Derivative Gravity. We argue that these modifications of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle are effective descriptions arising from the non-local features of gravitational interaction. By comparing the predictions of both the modified uncertainty principles and non-local gravity, we find theoretical constraints on otherwise free parameters as well as universal laws for black hole physics beyond General Relativity.

 - **Abstract**
 In this study, we investigate the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe within the framework of non-minimally coupled $f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, where $Q$ is the non-metricity scalar and $L_m$ is the matter Lagrangian. We derive modified Friedmann equations in a flat FLRW background and employ the \textit{Gong-Zhang} parameterization for the DE equation of state (EoS), allowing an analytical form of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. The model parameters are constrained using recent Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Pantheon+SH0ES Type Ia supernova datasets through MCMC-based chi-squared minimization. We analyze various cosmological quantities including the deceleration parameter, EoS, jerk, snap, lerk, and diagnostic tools such as $Om(z)$ and the statefinder pair $(r,s)$. Our findings indicate a viable transition from deceleration to acceleration and reveal a quintessence-to-phantom-like evolution of dark energy. Furthermore, energy conditions are examined, showing a violation of the strong energy condition, consistent with current cosmic acceleration. The results establish that the $f(Q,L_m) $ framework with non-minimal coupling and parameterized EoS provides a compelling alternative to $\Lambda$CDM in describing cosmic acceleration.

 - **Abstract**
 We study the formation and behaviour of bound states formed outside the horizon of a black hole in the presence of quintessence matter. Calculating the Regge and Wheeler potential for general metric function, we find that the presence of quintessence influences significantly the metric function and the Hawking temperature. We show that large black holes radiate less in the presence of large quintessence matter and it seems to live longer, while small black holes radiate more.

 - **Abstract**
 We present a model that offers an explanation for the presence of (Dark Matter and) Dark Energy in the universe. A key idea is to express the volume form of the Lorentzian metric on space-time in terms of a positive function of a new scalar field multiplying a certain four-form given by the wedge product of the differential of the mimetic scalar field and a certain closed three-form. An ansatz for this three-form related to one commonly used to determine the winding number of a map from a three-dimensional hypersurface to a three-sphere is discussed. An action functional depending on the space-time metric, the new scalar field, the mimetic scalar and the three-form is proposed, and the field equations are derived. Special solutions of these equations for a Friedmann-Lemaître universe are presented.

 - **Abstract**
 We study black hole imaging in the context of geometrically thick accretion disks in Schwarzschild spacetime. By decomposing the emitting region into a set of one-dimensional luminous segments, each characterized by its inclination angle and inner radius, we construct transfer functions that capture key image features-namely, the direct image, lensing ring, and photon ring. This approach allows a unified treatment of disk geometry and viewing angle. We explore three regimes: optically thin, optically thick, and partially optically thick disks. For optically thin flows, increasing the disk thickness broadens the lensing ring, gradually bridging the photon ring and the direct image. The photon ring remains narrow, but its position robustly defines the innermost edge of the lensing structure. In the optically thick case, image features are primarily determined by the first intersection of traced light rays with the disk, and we provide analytical criteria for the presence of lensing and photon rings based on the critical deflection angles. For partially optically thick disks, we adopt a simplified radiative transport model and find a critical absorption coefficient $\chi \sim (6M\psi_0)^{-1}$ beyond which the image rapidly transitions from an optically thin- to thick-disk appearance. These results help clarify the respective roles of the photon and lensing rings across different disk configurations, and may offer a useful framework for interpreting future high-resolution black hole observations.

 - **Abstract**
 Inaccurate modeling of gravitational-wave signals can introduce systematic biases in the inferred source parameters. As detector sensitivities improve and signals become louder, mitigating such waveform-induced systematics becomes increasingly important. In this work, we assess the systematic biases introduced by an incomplete description of the ringdown signal from massive black hole binaries in the LISA band. Specifically, we investigate the impact of mode truncation in the ringdown template. Using a reference waveform composed of 13 modes, we establish a mode hierarchy and determine the minimum number of modes required to avoid parameter biases across a wide range of LISA sources. For typical systems with masses $\sim 10^6$--$10^7\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $z \sim 2$--$6$, we find that at least 3--6 modes are needed for accurate parameter estimation, while high-SNR events may need at least 10 modes. Our results are a window-insensitive lower bound on the minimum number of modes, as more modes may be needed depending on the choice of time-domain windowing of the post-merger signal.

 We prove, unconditionally, the linear stability of the Kerr family in the full subextremal range. On an analytic level, our proof is the same as that of our earlier paper in the slowly rotating case. The additional ingredients we use are, firstly, the mode stability result proved by Andersson, Whiting, and the first author and, secondly, computations related to the zero energy behavior of the linearized gauge-fixed Einstein equation in work by the second author.

 - **Abstract**
 We investigate the production and detection of gravitational waves (GWs) within the framework of Gravitational Quantum Field Theory (GQFT). In this theory, GWs exhibit five propagating modes: one scalar, two vector, and two tensor modes. Unlike General Relativity, the gravitational field equations in GQFT involve both symmetric and antisymmetric tensors, governed by their respective energy-momentum tensors, both of which can act as sources for GW radiation. By solving the linearized gravitational equations, we derive general analytic expressions for the different GW degrees of freedom. Our analysis reveals that the symmetric energy-momentum tensor generates scalar and tensor GWs through the trace and traceless parts of the quadrupole moment, respectively. In contrast, the antisymmetric stress tensor induces scalar and vector GWs with enhanced coupling strengths. We examine two illustrative examples: a black hole binary with a slightly elliptical orbit, which produces scalar GWs, and a neutron star binary where one component has a net spin aligned with its velocity, leading to vector GW emission. Finally, we study the detectability of these GW polarizations by analyzing their signatures in GW detectors. Our findings indicate that current observatories can detect both scalar and tensor modes, while a newly designed detector would be required to probe vector GWs.

 We study the thermodynamic properties of black holes, taking into account the non-extensivity of their entropy at the thermodynamic and statistical level. To this end, we interpret the Rényi entropy as determining the fundamental thermodynamic equation, which is represented by a quasi-homogeneous function. As a consequence, the Rényi parameter turns out to be an independent thermodynamic variable that must be treated in the framework of extended thermodynamics. As a particular example, we use the formalism of geometrothermodynamics to show that the Schwarzschild black hole can become stable for certain values of the Rényi parameter.

 - **Abstract**
 A model in which black hole scalarization occurs for supermassive black holes, while their less massive counterparts remain unscalarized, has been recently proposed. We explore whether this model can emerge from an effective field theory obtained by integrating out a heavy second scalar field. We show that the resulting EFT does not have the right coupling sign or the right hierarchy of scales. We then consider whether supermassive black hole scalarization could occur in theories with two scalars. We show that, although they can violate black hole uniqueness through curvature- and spin-induced scalarization, they do not naturally produce scalarization exclusively for supermassive black holes.
